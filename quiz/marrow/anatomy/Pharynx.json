The nasopharynx is present above the soft palate and is made up of the roof, floor, posterior wall, \nand two lateral walls. Important structures seen in the nasopharynx are: • Pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube • Torus tubarius- tubal elevation which is present behind the opening of the eustachian tube. 596 \nSold by @itachibot • çossa of Žosenmuller- A lateral pharyngeal recess that is present behind the torus tubarius.

      "explanation": "Passavant's ridge is formed by palatopharyngeus and superior constrictor muscles. Some fibers of the palatopharyngeus muscle pass deep to the mucous membrane of the pharynx \nand form an internal sphincter to the superior constrictor. These muscles contract and cause a \nridge on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx which is known as Passavant's ridge. 597 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of a middle ear infection i.e., otitis media as a complication \nof pharyngitis. This is due to the spread of the infection via the eustachian tube. It opens \napproximately behind the posterior end of the inferior turbinate, in the lateral wall of \nthe nasopharynx. The eustachian tube connects the nasopharynx and the tympanic cavity in the middle ear. It is \nusually collapsed and opens during activities such as yawning or swallowing. Its function is to \nmaintain the pressure in the middle ear cavity and drain any secretions from the middle ear.",

Passavant's ridge is not seen in the oropharynx as it is present on the posterior \nwall of the nasopharynx. The oropharynx extends from below the soft palate to the upper border of the epiglottis.

Pyriform fossae are present between the aryepiglottic folds medially and thyroid cartilage, \nthyrohyoid membrane laterally. They serve as channels that direct the solid and liquid food from \nthe oral cavity into the esophagus. Clinical significance: Branches of the internal laryngeal nerve lie beneath the mucous membrane \nof the piriform fossa. èence this site can be used for infiltrating the local anesthetics.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a pulsion diverticulum on the barium swallow is suggestive of \nZenker's diverticulum. It originates through Killian's dehiscence, which is a site of weakness \npresent in the inferior constrictor muscle. The inferior constrictor muscle is made up of 2 parts: • Upper part - thyropharyngeus, made of oblique fibres. • Lower part - cricopharyngeus, made of transverse fibres. Between the two muscles, there is a potential gap which is called the pharyngeal dimple or \nKillian's dehiscence. Another site of weakness in the pharyngeal wall is the Laimer's triangle, which is present between \nthe cricopharyngeus and the longitudinal muscle of the oesophagus.",
