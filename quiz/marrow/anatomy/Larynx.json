Vocal ligament The saccule is a pouch that ascends forwards from the anterior end of the ventricle, between the \nvestibular fold and thyroid cartilage. It is conical in shape and contains around 60 and 70 mucous glands, sited in the submucosa. It is separated from the thyroid cartilage by the thyroepiglotticus muscle which compresses the \nsaccule. On compression, the secretions of the saccule are released into the vocal cords (which \nlack mucous glands) to lubricate and protect them from desiccation and infection. 610 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical significance: Laryngocele is an air-filled cystic swelling due to dilatation of the saccule. It is seen in trumpet \nplayers, glass-blowers, or weight lifters due to raised trans-glottic air pressure. It can be internal, \nexternal, or combined. External laryngocele presents as a reducible swelling in the neck which increases in size on \ncoughing or performing Valsalva maneuver. Internal laryngocele is managed by marsupialization and surgical excision through an external \nneck incision done for external laryngocele.",

      "explanation": "The nerve which is closely related to the course of the superior thyroid artery is the external \nlaryngeal nerve. Injury to this nerve causes paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle. It is the main \ntensor of the vocal cord and paralysis of this muscle leads to the decreased pitch of voice. The internal laryngeal nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane at a higher level than the superior \nthyroid artery.
