      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The vasa vasorum (Latin: vessels of the vessels) is a network of small blood vessels that supply \ntunica adventitia and the outer part of tunica media of large blood vessels. Blood supply of arteries: • Small arteries- The vessel wall gets nourishment by diffusion from the blood circulating in the \nvessel itself. When the vessel wall thickness is more than 1 mm, simple diffusion from the lumen \nbecomes inadequate. • Larger arteries- They have their own vascular supply within the adventitia called vasa \nvasorum. It supplies the adventitia and the outer part of the tunica media. The intima and the \ninner part of the media of large vessels are nourished directly by diffusion from the luminal blood. The given image shows a transverse section of the aorta showing vasa vasorum and the layers as \nfollows: • Tunica intima • Tunica media • Tunica adventitia • Vasa vasorum 1193 \nSold by @itachibot",

Precapillary or postcapillary communication between neighbouring vessels is called anastomoses. \nAnastomoses are of the following types: • Arterial anastomoses are communications between the arteries or branches of arteries. e.g., \npalmar arch, plantar arch, the circle of Willis. • Venous anastomoses are communications between the veins or tributaries of veins. e.g., dorsal \nvenous arches of the hand and foot. • Arteriovenous anastomosis (shunt) are communications between an artery and a vein. e.g., av \nshunts found in the skin of nose, lips, ears, mucosa of nose and intestines, and erectile tissue.

      "explanation": "Muscular arterioles contribute to the major part of peripheral resistance to blood flow. The smallest arteries of the muscular type are called arterioles. They have a tunica media that is \nrelatively thicker than the tunica adventitia. Arterioles cause the largest drop in blood pressure \nbefore the blood flows into the tissue capillary beds. They are densely innervated by sympathetic \nfibres. The contraction of arterioles is mainly regulated by local vasoactive and metabolic factors, \nbut central mechanisms also play a role.

They can be of two types: • Anatomic end arteries (or true end arteries) - do not have anastomoses. e.g., central artery of \nretina, internal auditory artery (labyrinthine artery of the internal ear). • Functional end arteries - have anastomoses but they are insufficient to provide adequate blood \nsupply when the main vessel is occluded. e.g., segmental arteries supplying the kidney.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The testicular veins have valves. Valves within the veins maintain a unidirectional flow of blood, even against gravity. Congenital \nabsence of valves in testicular veins may be a predisposing factor for the development of \nvaricocele. The inferior vena cava also has a valve (the Eustachian valve) to direct the flow of \noxygenated blood towards the foramen ovale to escape the pulmonary circulation. After birth, \nwith the establishment of the pulmonary circulation and the increase in systemic vascular \nresistance driving the closure of foramen ovale, the valve has no function and tends to regress.
