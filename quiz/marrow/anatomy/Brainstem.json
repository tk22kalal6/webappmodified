      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of contralateral hemiplegia and paralysis of the third cranial nerve is \nsuggestive of Weber syndrome involving the midbrain. In this, the tectum lies posterior to the \ncerebral aqueduct. The midbrain connects the pons and cerebellum with the forebrain. Externally, on the posterior \nsurface, there are two pairs of colliculi—the corpora quadrigemina: • The superior colliculi are centers for visual reflexes. The superior brachium connects the \nsuperior colliculi to the lateral geniculate body and the optic tract. • The inferior colliculi are auditory centres, and the inferior brachium connects the inferior \ncolliculus to the medial geniculate body. 410 \nSold by @itachibot The trochlear nerve emerges in the midline below the inferior colliculi. Internally, the midbrain comprises two cerebral peduncles. Each one is divided into an anterior \ncrus cerebri and a posterior tegmentum by the substantia nigra. The oculomotor nerve emerges \nfrom a groove on the medial side of crus cerebri and passes to the lateral wall of the cavernous \nsinus.",
