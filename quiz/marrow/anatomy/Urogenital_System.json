This bulge lateral to the attachment of the dorsal mesentery is known as \nthe urogenital ridge.

It forms the Bowman's \ncapsule, proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. • Ureteric bud, which is an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, gives rise to the collecting system \nof the kidney. It forms the collecting ducts, minor and major calyces, and renal pelvis. • Angiogenic mesenchyme, which migrates into the metanephric blastema, gives rise to the \nglomeruli and the vasa recta. 170 \nSold by @itachibot",

After this incorporation, the ureters now open separately into the bladder, near the opening of the \nmesonephric duct. Due to the ascent of the kidneys, the ureteral openings move farther cranially, \nwhile the openings of the mesonephric ducts move close together. The triangular area between \nthese ducts (trigone of the bladder) is thought to arise from the terminal portion of the \nmesonephric ducts. Recent update: It was considered that the epithelium of the trigone is initially mesodermal and is \nlater replaced by the endoderm-derived transitional epithelium. However, current research \nindicates that there is no mesodermal epithelial contribution to the bladder at the trigone (Gray's \nanatomy, 41st edition).",
