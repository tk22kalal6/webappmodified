      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The marrow cavity in the shaft of the fetal long bone mainly contains red marrow. Bone marrow is a soft, pulpy tissue found in the marrow cavity and the spaces of spongy bone. It \nis mainly of two types: • Yellow marrow - made up predominantly of fat cells and may contain few islands of hemopoietic \ntissue. It is seen in the shaft of the long bones of an adult. • Red marrow - It is made up predominantly of hemopoietic tissue. It is seen throughout the \nskeleton of the fetus. It persists till about five years of age after which, the red marrow in the shaft \nof long bones is gradually replaced by the yellow marrow. By around 20-25 years of age, the sites \nwhere the red marrow persists include: • Vertebrae • Sternum • Ribs • Clavicles • Scapulae • Pelvis • Cranial bones • Proximal ends of femur and humerus The term gelatinous marrow refers to the degenerated bone marrow in the cranial bones, seen in \nold age. There is no white marrow. 219 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "a": "The inorganic calcium salts make the bone tough and resilient.",
        "b": "The organic connective tissue affords resistance against compressive and impact forces.",

        "d": "The organic matrix constitutes about 65% of the dry weight of the bone."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Calcium phosphate in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite is the major constituent of the inorganic \nsalts present in the bone. The ground substance of the bone (bone matrix) is predominantly made up of inorganic mineral \nsalts, which constitute about 60-70% of the dry weight of the bone. These inorganic salts are \ndeposited within the organic matrix. • Inorganic mineral salts - makes the bone hard and rigid, and thus provides resistance to the \ncompressive and impact forces as in weight-bearing or jumping respectively. Its constituents are: • Calcium phosphate in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite (85% of total salts) 221 \nSold by @itachibot • Calcium carbonate (10% of total salts), magnesium, chloride, fluoride, citrate, sodium, and \npotassium. • Organic matrix - makes the bone tough and resilient (flexible) and thus provides resistance to the \ntensile forces. Its constituents are: • Type I collagen (predominantly) • Glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and water. • Osteonectin and osteocalcin - predominant glycoproteins present in bone. These bind to calcium \nand help in the mineralization of the bone. • Other substances include chondroitin sulfates, phospholipids, and phosphoproteins. Note: Histological preparation of bone sections involves a process called decalcification, wherein \nthe inorganic mineral salts of the bone are removed by treating the bone with weak acids or \nchelating agents such as EDTA or citrate. The decalcification causes the bone to lose its rigidity.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "During the formation of bone, the mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts secrete type I collagen and \ngelatinous matrix (unmineralized bone matrix), which together forms the osteoid. The collagen fibers swell up within the gelatinous matrix and become indistinct. Calcium salts are \ndeposited into the gelatinous matrix under the influence of osteoblasts and this process is called \nmineralization.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "222 \nSold by @itachibot The structure marked as A in the above image is Volkmann's canal. The Haversian canals \ncommunicate with each other by the transverse perforating canals, which are called Volkmann's \ncanals. The Haversian system or osteon constitute most part of the compact bone. Each Haversian system \ncontains a central canal within which the small blood vessels, nerves, and endosteum are present. \nThis canal is surrounded by multiple layers or lamellae of the calcified matrix containing type I \ncollagen fibers. These canals communicate with each other by Volkmann's canal. Successive lamellae are separated from each other by lacunae containing osteocytes. These \nosteocytes are in communication with each other, the central canal and the periphery of the \nosteon via the dendritic processes present within the canaliculi. The parallel lamellae present \nbetween osteons is called interstitial lamellae and the parallel lamellae present near the \nperiosteum are called the circumferential lamellae. On microscopy, osteon can be identified by • Presence of Haversian canal with concentric lamellae around it • Volkmann's canal • Osteocytes with canaliculi • Interstitial lamellae • Circumferential lamellae 223 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Membranous bones (and not membranocartilagenous bones) are also known as dermal bones. The bone is classified into three categories on the basis of pattern of development as follows: • Membranous bones - These bones ossify from highly vascular membranes of primitive \nmesenchyme. At centres of ossification, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoprogenitor \ncells which give rise to osteoblasts. These osteoblasts help in the formation of bone. e.g., bones of \nthe skull and facial bones. • Cartilaginous bones - These bones ossify from hyaline cartilage. The deeper layers of the \nperichondrium surrounding the cartilage contain osteoprogenitor cells which help in bone \nformation. e.g., bones of limbs, vertebral column and thoracic cage. 224 \nSold by @itachibot • Membranocartilaginous bones - These bones ossify partly from cartilage and partly from \nmesenchymal condensations. e.g., clavicle, mandible, occipital, temporal and sphenoid.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The type of cartilage shown in the above image is hyaline cartilage and it is present in bronchi. Hyaline cartilage is made up of chondrocytes and matrix. The chondrocytes in the deeper matrix \nare rounded in shape and may appear in a group of eight that originate by the mitotic divisions of \na single chondroblast. These groups of cells are called isogenous cell aggregates or cell nests. The \nimportant components of the matrix are type II collagen, aggrecan (proteoglycan) and \nchondronectin (glycoprotein). The matrix which immediately surrounds the chondrocytes is \nbasophilic and is known as the territorial matrix and the matrix which are more distant from the \ncells appears pale and is known as the interterritorial matrix. On microscopy, hyaline cartilage can be identified by: • Presence of chondrocytes within lacunae. • Group of two or more chondrocytes which are known as isogenous cell aggregates or cell nests. • Basophilic territorial matrix and pale interterritorial matrix • Presence of perichondrium with outer fibrous and the inner cellular layer",
