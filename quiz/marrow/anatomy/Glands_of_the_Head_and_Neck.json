      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario is suggestive of postoperative hypoparathyroidism due to injury to \nthe superior branch of the inferior thyroid artery. The parathyroid glands are small yellowish-brown structures lying between the posterior border \nof the thyroid gland and its capsule. There are • Two superior parathyroid glands • Two inferior parathyroid glands These are supplied by the superior branch of the inferior thyroid artery. They secrete \nparathormone which helps in the regulation of the serum calcium, by the release of calcium from \nbones. 579 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Sternothyroid and sternohyoid prevent the upward extension of the thyroid swelling through its \nattachment to the thyroid cartilage. Pretracheal fascia encloses the thyroid gland and is attached to the larynx. This attachment is \nresponsible for the movement of the enlarged thyroid gland on deglutition. The thyrohyoid membrane is a fibro-elastic ligament, which arises from the superior margin of \nthe thyroid cartilage, and gets attached to the hyoid bone. It facilitates the upward movement of \nthe larynx during swallowing. The ligament of Berry, also called the suspensory ligament extends from the cricoid cartilage to \nthe thyroid. Its attachment prevents the thyroid gland from sinking down into the mediastinum. 580 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The newly discovered salivary glands are predominantly present over torus tubarius. Torus \ntubarius is the anatomical structure formed by the cartilage that supports the entrance of the \nauditory tube. The proposed name of these newly identified glands is tubarial salivary glands. These glands \nextend caudally to the pharyngeal wall and cranially to Rosenmuller's fossa. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography with radio-labeled ligands to the \nprostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA PET/CT) can visualize these salivary glands with high \nsensitivity and specificity. Clinical significance: It has been reported that radiotherapy over the location of these glands has led to xerostomia and \ndysphagia. Sparing these glands, thus, might improve the quality of life of patients receiving \nradiotherapy. 581 \nSold by @itachibot Tongue and Palate",
