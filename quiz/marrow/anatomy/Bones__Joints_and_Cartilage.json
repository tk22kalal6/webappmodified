      "explanation": "The Haversian system is seen in compact bones, not cancellous bones. Based on their macroscopic structure, bones can be classified as compact and cancellous (spongy) \nbones. Compact bones are composed of cylindrical structural units called Haversian systems or \nosteons. Each Haversian system contains a central canal within which the small blood vessels, \nnerves, and endosteum are present. This canal is surrounded by multiple layers or lamellae of the \ncalcified matrix containing type I collagen fibers. These canals communicate with each other by \nVolkmann's canal. 1157 \nSold by @itachibot The lamellae of the cancellous/spongy bone are arranged in a meshwork, and hence do not form \nHaversian systems. The diaphysis and outer cortex of long bones are predominantly made of compact bone, while the \nepiphysis and inner medulla are predominantly made of cancellous bone.",

At the articular margin, the periosteum is \ncontinuous with the capsule of the joint. The periosteum has 2 layers: 1158 \nSold by @itachibot • The outer fibrous layer - contains fibroblasts. • The inner cambium layer (osteogenic layer) - contains progenitor cells that develop into \nosteoblasts.

Based on their development, bones can be classified into 3 categories: • Membranous bones (dermal bones) are formed through intramembranous ossification. There is \ndirect bone formation within highly vascular sheets or ‘membranes’ derived from mesenchymal \ncondensations. e.g., bones of the facial skeleton including the frontal, lacrimal, zygomatic, and \nnasal bones. • Cartilaginous bones are formed by intra-cartilaginous (enchondral) ossification. Bone forms by \nossification of preformed hyaline cartilage model. This is the main method of bone formation in \nthe body. e.g., bones of limbs, vertebral column, and thoracic cage. • Membranocartilaginous bones ossify from both cartilage and mesenchymal condensation. \ne.g., clavicle, mandible, occipital bone, temporal bone, sphenoid bone, etc.",

Ellipsoid joints have an oval, convex (male) surface fitting into an elliptical concave (female) \nsurface. They show biaxial movements such as flexion-extension, and abduction–adduction. A \ncombination of these movements results in circumduction. Movement on the third axis is \nprevented due to the general articular shape. E.g., Wrist (radiocarpal) joint, atlanto-occipital joints, metacarpophalangeal joints, and \nmetatarsophalangeal joints.",

Protraction occurs when the lower jaw is \npushed forward, while retraction pulls the lower jaw backward. Protraction and retraction also occur in the scapula. During protraction, the scapula is moved \nlaterally and anteriorly along the chest wall, such as during rowing movements. Retraction is \nbringing scapula back to the original position after protraction. Option A: Opposition is the thumb movement that brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the \ntip of a finger. Returning the thumb to its anatomical position next to the index finger is called \nreposition. Option B: Excursion is the side to side movement of the mandible. Option D: Depression and elevation are downward and upward movements of the mandible (or \nscapula), respectively.",
