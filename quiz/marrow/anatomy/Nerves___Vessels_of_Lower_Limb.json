The patient shows characteristic lurching gait/ Trendelenburg's gait (positive Trendelenburg's \nsign), which is seen in paralysis of gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles. These muscles \nare supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the \nopposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action \nresults in the slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk \nin the upright position. When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported \n(normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. 1101 \nSold by @itachibot In the given case, when the patient lifts up his right leg and tries to stand on the left leg, his right \npelvis tilts down.
