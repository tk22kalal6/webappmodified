      "explanation": "The core of each pharyngeal arch (branchial arch) is derived from mesoderm and neural crest \ncells. Pharyngeal arches initially have identical structures: • Surface ectoderm on the outside • A mesenchymal core derived from mesoderm • Endoderm derived epithelium on the inside The mesoderm in the arches is derived from paraxial mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm. This \nis invaded by the neural crest cells that contribute to the formation of skeletal elements and \nconnective tissue of the head and neck region. 71 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The 5th pharyngeal arch disappears soon after its formation, so only 5 arches remain. Pharyngeal arches appear in the 4th or 5th week of development and contribute to the formation \nof the head and neck region. They are formed as a series of 6 thickenings in the cranial most part \nof the foregut (the future pharynx). They are craniocaudally numbered from I to VI. The 5th \npharyngeal arch disappears, so only 5 arches remain. • The first pharyngeal arch is also known as the mandibular arch • The second pharyngeal arch is also known as the hyoid arch • The 3rd, 4th, and 6th pharyngeal arches have no special names 72 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The pharyngeal membrane is the location where the ectoderm of the pharyngeal cleft meets the \nendoderm of the pharyngeal pouch. In the interval between any two adjoining pharyngeal arches, the endoderm extends outward in \nthe form of a pouch (pharyngeal pouch) to meet the ectoderm, which dips into this interval as a \npharyngeal cleft. The membrane formed where the pharyngeal cleft comes in contact with the \npouch is called the pharyngeal membrane. Initially, there are four pharyngeal membranes between the five arches. Only the first pharyngeal \nmembrane develops and contributes to the formation of the tympanic membrane. The 2nd, 3th, \nand 4th pharyngeal membranes do not develop further into any structure. They get obliterated \nwhen the mesoderm from the 2nd arch overgrows and fills the succeeding clefts. 73 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The tongue muscles are derived from the myotomes of the occipital somites. The tongue muscles get their motor supply from the hypoglossal nerve (12th cranial nerve), except \nthe palatoglossus muscle, which is supplied by the vagus nerve. Development of the tongue • The anterior part of the tongue (body) is derived from the 1st pharyngeal arch. It is formed from \n2 lateral lingual swellings and one medial swelling called the tuberculum impar. • The posterior part of the tongue (root) is derived from the mesoderm of the 2nd, 3rd, and part of \nthe 4th arch. This part develops from a medial swelling called copula (hypobranchial eminence). • The posterior-most part of the tongue and the epiglottis are derived from a third swelling formed \nin the posterior part of the 4th arch. 84 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of a branchial cyst that develops due to the persistence of \nthe cervical sinus. The cervical sinus is formed when the 2nd arch mesoderm overgrows the succeeding arches and \noverhangs them as shown in the image. The space between the overhanging 2nd pharyngeal \narch and the 3rd, 4th, and 6th arches is called the cervical sinus. The cavity of the cervical sinus is \nlined by ectoderm and normally gets obliterated. In some individuals, a part of the cervical sinus may persist and give rise to swellings known as \nbranchial cysts. It is present in the neck along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid \nmuscle. These cysts are most commonly located just below the angle of the mandible. If the \nbranchial cyst opens onto the surface, it becomes a branchial sinus. 85 \nSold by @itachibot",

The vertebral bodies and the annulus fibrosus (peripheral part of the intervertebral disc) are \nderived from the mesenchymal cells of the sclerotome.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The long left recurrent laryngeal nerve is due to the persistence of the left 6th arch artery. During the development, the laryngeal nerves initially arise below the 6th arch artery and cross \nhere to innervate the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. As the larynx moves cranially relative to the \naortic arch arteries, the recurrent laryngeal nerves on the right and left sides are caught under the \n6th arch arteries. On the right side, the distal 6th arch artery disappears. Since there is no 5th arch artery, the right \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under the 4th arch artery which becomes the future \nright subclavian artery. On the left side, the 6th arch artery persists, which develops into ductus arteriosus, which later \nforms ligamentum arteriosum. Due to the persistence of the 6th arch artery, the left recurrent \nlaryngeal nerve is caught under it and therefore, has a relatively long course. 86 \nSold by @itachibot Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems",
