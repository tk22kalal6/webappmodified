      "explanation": "The region marked corresponds to the surface marking for the right atrium. The costal margin, xiphoid process, and the mid-clavicular line are seen in this image. The \nexaminer draws a laterally convex line that extends from a level below the 2nd costal cartilage (as \nclued in by the sternal angle) i.e., 3rd costal cartilage to about 3 spaces below i.e., the 6th costal \ncartilage. This line is about 1.2 cms lateral to the sternal edge. These suggest that the region \nmarked corresponds to the surface marking for the right atrium. The projection of the cardiac borders, of an average adult, onto the anterior thoracic wall forms a \ntrapezoid. This can be mapped out using the percussion method by looking for cardiac dullness. The varying heart borders and the corresponding surface markings are as follows: • Upper border: Slopes gently from the second left costal cartilage to the third right costal \ncartilage. It corresponds to the left atrium. 827 \nSold by @itachibot • Right border: Convex to the right and runs from the third to the sixth right costal cartilages, 1–2 \ncm lateral to the sternal edge.
