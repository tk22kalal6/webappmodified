      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The correct order of the given layers from deep to superficial is stratum \nbasale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum corneum. Most of the body is covered by thin skin that has 4 layers as follows (superficial to deep): • stratum corneum • stratum granulosum • stratum spinosum • stratum basale Some parts of the body such as the palms, soles and flexor surfaces of digits have thick skin \n(glabrous skin) with 5 layers as follows (superficial to deep): • stratum corneum • stratum lucidum • stratum granulosum • stratum spinosum • stratum basale Mnemonic for skin layers (superficial to deep): Come Let's Get Some Beer (Corneum, Lucidum, \nGranulosum, Spinosum, and Basale).

      "explanation": "Non-nucleated cells are present in the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. The cells are \ndevoid of both a nucleus and membranous organelles. The cells in this layer contain densely arranged keratin filaments within the cytoplasmic matrix \nproviding a barrier function that prevents the entry of microbes from the environment and \nleakage of fluids from the body.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of an itchy, asymmetrical pigmented lesion on the face with \nan irregular border(image) that rapidly grew in size, points towards a diagnosis of malignant \nmelanoma arising from the melanocytes. These cells are present in the stratum basale layer of the \nepidermis. Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells. They produce melanin which is packed into \norganelles called melanosomes and transferred via finger-like processes called dendrites to \nthe keratinocytes.",

They are primarily present in the dermal papillae of all parts of the hand and foot, the lips, the \nanterior aspect of the forearm, palpebral conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the apical part of \nthe tongue. They are highly concentrated in the finger pads. Meissner’s corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to shape and \ntextural changes during exploratory and discriminatory touch.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The muscle responsible for goosebumps (image) is the arrector pili muscle which is a smooth \nmuscle supplied by the sympathetic nerves. It connects the dermal sheath of the hair follicles to \nthe papillary layer of the dermis. Contraction of these muscles makes the hair more vertical (piloerection), elevates the epidermis \naround the hair (goosebump), and dimples the skin surface where the muscle is inserted.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The statement 'ligaments are devoid of nerve supply' is false. Ligaments have a rich nerve supply. This helps them function as sense organs and participate \nin reflex mechanisms important for monitoring the position and movements of the joint. Intrinsic \nligaments surround the joint, whereas extrinsic ligaments are away and independent of the joint. The majority of ligaments are made up of collagen fibres predominantly. These are inelastic and \nnot stretchable. Ligamentum flavum and ligaments of auditory ossicles are exceptions, as \nthey predominantly have elastin fibres that make them elastic and stretchable.",
