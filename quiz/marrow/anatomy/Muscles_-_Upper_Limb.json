      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The drooping of the shoulder is due to the paralysis of the trapezius muscle. The trapezius is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI). It causes: • Retraction of scapula • Shrugging of the shoulder • Overhead abduction (along with serratus anterior) Paralysis of the trapezius causes drooping of the shoulder and slight winging of the scapula (the \nsuperior angle of the scapula becomes more prominent). 713 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The lumbricals and interossei muscles are affected. The lumbricals and interossei muscles through their attachments to the dorsal digital expansions, \ncause: • Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints • Extension of the interphalangeal (IP) joints In cases of ulnar nerve injury, these muscles may get atrophied leading to the extension of MCP \njoints and flexion of IP joints. 729 \nSold by @itachibot Note: The ulnar nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the hand, except for • First and second lumbrical • Abductor pollicis brevis • Opponens pollicis • Part of flexor pollicis brevis",
