Nutcracker syndrome is characterized by left renal vein hypertension, which occurs due to the \ncompression of the left renal vein between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric \nartery.

It runs anterior to the aorta just below the \norigin of the superior mesenteric artery and drains into the inferior vena cava after crossing the \nmidline.

      "explanation": "The median lobe of the prostate forms the uvula vesicae. Uvula vesicae is an elevation in the mucous membrane of the urinary bladder, behind the internal \nurethral orifice. It is often enlarged in benign prostatic hypertrophy.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The internal urethral orifice lies at the level of the upper border of the pubic symphysis at birth. At birth, the bladder is an abdominal organ. But as the child grows, the blader descends, and near \npuberty, it becomes a pelvic organ. In an adult, the internal urethral orifice lies 3–4 cm behind the lower part of the pubic symphysis. \nIt corresponds to the bladder neck. Clinical note: As the bladder lies above the symphysis pubis, we can safely perform suprapubic \nneedle punctures to obtain urine samples in children. But in adults, this can only be done if the \nbladder is fully distended.",

These neurons contract the external urethral sphincter. 968 \nSold by @itachibot The external urethral sphincter is made up of skeletal muscle fibers. In the contracted state, they \nare responsible for the maintenance of urinary continence. Just before the onset of voiding the \nsphincter is relaxed. This happens because the neurons in the Onuf's nucleus are centrally \ninhibited by the brain. The below image shows Onuf's nucleus located in the lamina IX.

      "explanation": "There are five arterial segments in the kidney: • Apical • Superior • Middle • Inferior • Posterior Blood supply of the kidney: The renal artery is a direct lateral branch of the abdominal aorta. Near \nthe hilum of the kidney, the renal artery is divided into anterior and posterior divisions. These \ndivisions are further divided into five segmental arteries (four anterior and one posterior). The \nsegmental arteries further branch out in a hierarchy to form different arteries. Finally, the renal \nvein is formed which joins the inferior vena cava. 970 \nSold by @itachibot 971 \nSold by @itachibot Internal and external genitalia",
