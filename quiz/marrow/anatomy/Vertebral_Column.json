      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The typical cervical vertebrae are characterized by a foramen in the transverse process called the \nforamen transversarium. This foramen transversarium transmits the vertebral artery and vein, along with a branch from \nthe cervicothoracic ganglion (vertebral nerve). Lateral parts of the transverse processes of the \ncervical vertebrae also contain the anterior and posterior tubercles. The images given below illustrate a typical cervical and thoracic vertebrae respectively.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The vertebral column consists of 33 bones. Generally, the number of vertebrae found in each \nsegment are as follows: • 7 cervical • 12 thoracic • 5 lumbar • 5 sacral • 4 coccygeal However, this total is subject to frequent variability, and there have been reports of variation \nbetween 32 and 35 vertebrae. The total length of vertebral column is about 70 cm in males and about 60 cm in females on an \naverage. Fibrocartilaginous intervertebral discs separate neighboring vertebrae in the cervical, \nthoracic and lumbar region (except the first 2 cervical vertebrae). The vertebral column supports \nthe trunk, protects the spinal cord and nerves, and provide attachments for muscles. It is also an \nimportant site of hematopoiesis throughout life.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The cervical-kyphosis pair is incorrectly matched. The cervical part of the vertebral column \nnormally demonstrates lordosis. During embryonic life, the body appears flexed and has 2 primary spinal curvatures. These are the \nthoracic and the pelvic curves, which are convex dorsally. After birth, functional muscle \ndevelopment leads to the early appearance of secondary spinal curvatures. These are the cervical \nand the lumbar curves, both of which are convex forwards (lordosis). Normal adult curvatures of the vertebral column are as follows: • The cervical curve is lordosis (convex forwards) • The thoracic curve is kyphosis (convex dorsally) • The lumbar curve is lordosis (convex forwards) • The pelvic curve is concave anteroinferiorly The image given below illustrates the adult vertebral column. 1134 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The thoracic curvature is a primary curve and is developed during embryonic life itself. Both the primary curves (thoracic and pelvic) that appear during embryonic life are convex \ndorsally. After birth, functional muscle development results in the appearance of secondary \ncervical and lumbar spinal curvatures in the sagittal plane. • The secondary cervical curvature occurs with the development of function in the muscles \nresponsible for the head extension. • The secondary lumbar curvature occurs with the development of function in the muscles \nresponsible for sitting upright and walking.",

      "explanation": "The craniovertebral joints do not include the wings of the sphenoid. These connect the cranium to the vertebral column. • They include the atlanto-occipital joints and atlanto-axial joints. • The bones involved include the occipital condyles, the atlas, and the axis. These joints are specialized to provide greater mobility than seen in the rest of the axial skeleton. \nTogether, they function as a universal joint that allows horizontal and vertical scanning \nmovements of the head. Occipitocervical fusion and stabilization surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with \noccipitocervical pathologies including trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, congenital malformations, \nneoplasms, and degeneration. High degree of mobility and the sharp angle at which the occiput \nmeets the upper cervical spine, makes rigid surgical fixation challenging. 1135 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The transverse atlantal ligament is a component of the cruciform ligaments at the atlanto-axial \njoints. Cruciform ligaments are shaped like a cross: • The horizontal component of the cross is formed by the transverse atlantal ligament. It is \nattached on each side to the lateral mass of atlas. It retains the dens in position. • The vertical component of the cross is formed by the superior and inferior longitudinal \nligaments. • Superior longitudinal ligament arises from the upper margin of the transverse atlantal ligament \nand inserts into the basilar part of the occipital bone. • Inferior longitudinal ligament arises from the lower margin of the transverse atlantal ligament \nand inserts to the posterior surface of the axis vertebra. 1136 \nSold by @itachibot Other ligaments at the atlanto-axial joints: • Membrana tectoria- Strong band found inside the vertebral canal, which is the upward \ncontinuation of the posterior longitudinal ligament • Alar ligaments- Thick cords from the apex of the dens to the medial side of the occipital condyles • Apical ligament of the dens- Connects the apex of dens to the anterior margin of the foramen \nmagnum between the alar ligaments",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Rotation is anatomically restricted in the lumbar region. The given clinical vignette is suggestive of carcinoma prostate, which has metastasised to the \nlumbar spine. Anatomically, the lumbar region of the vertebral column has a restricted range for \nrotational movements. Movements of the vertebral column: • Flexion of the spine is accompanied by relaxation of the anterior longitudinal ligament and \ncompression of the anterior parts of the intervertebral discs. Flexion is effectively absent in the \nthoracic region. Flexion movements are greater than extension or lateral flexion in the lumbar \nregion. • Extension is marked in cervical and lumbar regions. It is significantly less at thoracic levels as \ntheir discs are thinner and because of the ribs and chest musculature. • Lateral flexion is flexion combined with coupled axial rotation. Lateral movements occur in all \nparts of the column but are the greatest in the cervical and lumbar regions. • Axial rotation is the highest in the cervical region, 50% of which occurs at the atlantoaxial joint. \nAll the other spine segments below the cervical have only a slight range of rotation, among which \nthe thoracolumbar junction has the most. The remainder of the lumbar region has very little \nrotation. 1138 \nSold by @itachibot",
