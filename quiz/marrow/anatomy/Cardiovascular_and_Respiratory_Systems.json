The liver cords grow into the septum \nbreaking the course of this vein into an extensive vascular network known as hepatic sinusoids. \nThe sinusoids form the hepatic vein and drain into the inferior vena cava. • Portal vein: The anastomotic plexus formed by the vitelline veins around the duodenum \ndevelops into a single vessel called the portal vein. • Inferior vena cava: The hepatocardiac portion of IVC develops from the right hepatocardiac \nchannel, which is derived from the right vitelline vein. • Superior mesenteric vein: This vein is derived from the right vitelline vein and drains the \nprimary intestinal loop.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The larynx and trachea develop from the laryngotracheal tube. The laryngotracheal (respiratory) diverticulum develops from the ventral wall of the pharyngeal \npart of the foregut. The free caudal end of the respiratory diverticulum elongates downwards to enter the thorax, \nwhere it bifurcates to form the right and left bronchial buds or lung buds, which in turn further \ndevelops to form the bronchi and the lung parenchyma. The part of the diverticulum cranial to the bifurcation is known as laryngotracheal tube, which \nfurther develops to form the larynx and trachea.",

      "explanation": "The most common type of tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is esophageal atresia with distal \nTEF (also known as type C). 107 \nSold by @itachibot It occurs due to the defective formation of the tracheoesophageal septum. There is an abnormal \nconnection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea. These defects occur in approximately \n1/3000 births. The condition is commonly associated with esophageal atresia. TEF can be grossly classified into 5 types, types A to E, as shown in the image below:",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It most commonly \noccurs due to failure of fusion of pleuroperitoneal folds during the development of the diaphragm. The diaphragm develops from 4 mesodermal sources as follows: • Septum transversum becomes the anterior and medial part of the diaphragm including the \ncentral tendon • Pleuroperitoneal membranes (paired structures) become the dorsolateral parts of the diaphragm • Mesoderm of body wall from somites of cervical segments three to five (C3-5) contribute to the \nperipheral muscular part • Mesentery of the esophagus forms the crura of the diaphragm 109 \nSold by @itachibot Congenital diaphragmatic hernia results due to failure of various structures forming diaphragm to \nfuse. It occurs in 1/2000 births. The defect allows abdominal viscera to enter the pleural cavity. It \nis most frequently caused by the failure of one or both of the pleuroperitoneal membranes to fuse. \nPosterolateral defects (Bochdalek’s hernia) are the most common (85–90%). 110 \nSold by @itachibot Alimentary, Hepatobiliary systems, Pancreas and Spleen",
