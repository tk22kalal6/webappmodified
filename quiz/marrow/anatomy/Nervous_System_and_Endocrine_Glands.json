      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The spinal cord develops from the caudal part of the neural tube. The nervous system develops from the neurectoderm i.e. the specialized ectoderm overlying the \nnotochord. The neuroectoderm initially thickens to form the neural plate. The neural plate is then \nconverted to a neural groove, followed by a neural tube. • The enlarged cranial part of neural tube forms the brain. It has 3 primary vesicles that form: • Forebrain (prosencephalon) • Midbrain (mesencephalon) • Hindbrain (rhombencephalon) • The narrow caudal part of the neural tube forms the spinal cord.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The sulcus limitans is located between the sensory alar and the motor basal plates. The cells in the wall of the neural tube proliferate and are subdivided into the inner mantle layer \nand outer marginal layer. Due to the fast growth of the mantle layer cells, the lumen of the neural \ntube gets compressed. The line separating the compressed ventral part from the dorsal part is called the sulcus limitans. \nWhen the sulcus limitans is formed, the tube is divided into the dorsal or alar lamina and ventral \nor basal lamina. In the spinal cord, the ventral thickenings or basal plates contain ventral motor horn cells. The \ndorsal thickenings i.e. the alar plates contain the interneurones that receive the terminals of \nprimary sensory neurons.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The first commissure to develop is the anterior commissure. 155 \nSold by @itachibot Commissures are fibre bundles that cross the midline and connect the right and left brain \nhemispheres. Many important fiber bundles cross at lamina terminalis. Commissures at lamina terminalis: • Anterior commissure - first commissure to appear. These fibers connect the olfactory bulb and \nrelated brain areas to the corresponding structures in the contralateral hemisphere. • Hippocampal commissure (fornix commissure) - develops second. The fibers emerge from the \nhippocampus and reach the lamina terminalis. From here, they arch outside the choroid fissure to \nthe mamillary body and the hypothalamus. • Corpus callosum - appears by the 10th week. It connects the non-olfactory areas of the right and \nthe left cerebral cortices.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The structure marked as A in the image is the corpus callosum. It develops from the lamina \nterminalis. Lamina terminalis is a part of the wall of the neural tube that closes the cranial end of the \nprosencephalon. The lamina terminalis becomes thickened to form the commissural plate that \nfacilitates the passage of neurons between the two hemispheres. There are 3 commissures that pass through lamina terminalis: • Anterior commissure 156 \nSold by @itachibot • Hippocampal commissure • Corpus callosum The corpus callosum is the largest of these commisures. Initially, corpus callosum forms a small \nbundle in the lamina terminalis. Due to the continuous expansion, it extends anteriorly and \nposteriorly arching over the thin roof of the diencephalon. It connects the non-olfactory areas of \nthe right and the left cerebral cortices.",

Based on the degree of defect and tissues herniating, they are classified as follows: • Meningocele - Defect is small and only meninges bulge through it • Meningoencephalocele - Defect is large and a part of brain bulges with the meninges • Meningohydroencephalocele - Defect is large and a part of the brain and ventricle bulge with the \nmeninges",

This becomes the anterior lobe of the pituitary (pars distalis). The neurohypophysis or posterior pituitary, develops from the neuroectoderm. A downward \nextension of the diencephalon, called infundibular process, grows down from the floor of the 3rd \nventricle, during the 6th week.
