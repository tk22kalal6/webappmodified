      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The structure related to the anterior surface of the affected bone i.e. the proximal femur is the \nintertrochanteric line. It is present at the junction of the neck and shaft of the femur. The femur can be divided into: • Proximal femur - consists of the head, neck, greater and lesser trochanters. The intertrochanteric \nline is present on the anterior surface at the junction of the neck and shaft of the femur. The \nintertrochanteric crest is present on the posterior surface. • Shaft of the femur - consists of linea aspera (bony crest present on the posterior surface), gluteal \ntuberosity, and pectineal line. • Distal femur - consists of the medial condyle, lateral condyle, intercondylar fossa, and patellar \nsurface. The images given below shows the anatomy of the femur bone. 1027 \nSold by @itachibot Spiral fractures of long bones such as femur or humerus in a child suggest an external application \nof a twisting force. This is highly suspicious of non-accidental trauma. The probable diagnosis is \nbattered baby syndrome.",

      "explanation": "The normal angle of the neck of the femur to the shaft is approximately 125°. This is known as \nneck-shaft angle or angle of inclination. This facilitates the movement at the hip joint, enabling the limb to move freely. • When the angle is &gt; 135°, the condition is known as coxa valga • When the angle is &lt; 120°, the condition is known as coxa vara The image given below shows the normal neck-shaft angle of femur. 1028 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The arterial supply to the femoral head is mostly by the medial circumflex femoral artery. 1029 \nSold by @itachibot The blood supply of the femoral head is derived from an arterial ring (trochanteric anastomosis) \naround the neck of the femur constituted by: • Medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, branches of profunda femoris artery • Superior and inferior gluteal vessels (minor contributions) In the fetus and early postnatal period, the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries \ncontribute equally. Whereas in the later life the supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery \ndiminishes and it is mainly supplied by two major arteries of the medial circumflex femoral \narteries.

      "explanation": "The patella is an example of sesamoid bone, which is formed within the tendon of the quadriceps \nfemoris muscle. It is triangular in shape and lies in the patellofemoral groove. The apex is directed inferiorly which \ngives attachment to the patellar ligament and the base is directed superiorly which gives \nattachment to the quadriceps femoris muscle. Its convex anterior surface is perforated by numerous nutrient vessels and is separated from the \nskin by a prepatellar bursa. Its posterior surface has an oval articular area crossed by a smooth \nvertical ridge that fits into the intercondylar groove. This ridge divides the patellar articular area \ninto medial and lateral facets. These facets articulate with the corresponding condyles of the \nfemur. 1033 \nSold by @itachibot Important sesamoid bones: • Patella - largest sesamoid bone in the tendon of quadriceps femoris. • Pisiform - tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris. • Fabella - lateral head of the gastrocnemius. • Two sesamoid bones can be found in the first metacarpal within the tendons of flexor pollicis \nbrevis and adductor pollicis. • Two sesamoid bones can be found in the first metatarsophalangeal articulation within the \ndouble tendon of flexor hallucis brevis.",
