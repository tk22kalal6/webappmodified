      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of post-traumatic cerebellar ataxia presenting with \nimpaired balance. The largest part of the affected structure i.e. the cerebellum is the middle lobe, \nalso known as the posterior lobe. The gait shown in the above video is a cerebellar ataxic \ngait. Here, the patient is seen attempting tandem walking and displaying improper heel-toe \ncoordination, erratic foot placement, and truncal swaying. The cerebellum consists of two hemispheres (right and left) joined by a median vermis. It is \ndivided into three lobes: • Anterior lobe - lies superiorly above the primary fissure • Middle lobe - lies inferiorly below the primary fissure • Flocculonodular lobe - lies posterior to the uvulonodular fissure It has two surfaces, superior and inferior, separated by a horizontal fissure. It is connected to the \nother parts of the central nervous system via three peduncles. 428 \nSold by @itachibot",
