It involves the diencephalon, a structure that is derived \nfrom the prosencephalon. The diencephalon forms the thalamus, epithalamus, subthalamus, and hypothalamus.

The thalamus is an ovoid shape mass of grey matter that forms a relay station for all information \npassing to the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and brainstem. 397 \nSold by @itachibot Relations of the thalamus: • Anteriorly: Interventricular foramen • Superiorly: It is covered by a sheet of white matter called stratum zonale. Above the stratum \nzonale lies the body of fornix and the ventricle • Posteriorly: The posterior end is expanded to form the pulvinar, which overhangs above the \nsuperior colliculus. • Inferiorly: Plane connecting the hypothalamic sulci • Medially: Lateral wall of the third ventricle • Laterally: Posterior limb of the internal capsule The image below demonstrates the lateral and medial relations of the thalamus. 398 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical stem of a hemi-sensory loss and severe excruciating pain of the affected areas is \nsuggestive of thalamic pain syndrome also known as Dejerine Roussy \nsyndrome. Hence, thalamus marked as B is most likely to be involved. Occlusion of these thalamic and thalamogeniculate branches results in the thalamic pain \nsyndrome. It is characterized by C/L hemisensory loss which starts as numbness and progresses to \ncause severe burning pain in the affected regions. As the thalamus is the site for the relay of \nsensory information between the periphery and cortex, a lesion in the thalamus causes a \nmiscommunication between the afferent pathway and cortex of the brain. Pain occurs during the \nrecovery from the thalamic infarct. This pain responds poorly to analgesics. Anticonvulsants such \nas carbamazepine or gabapentin or tricyclic antidepressants may be beneficial.
