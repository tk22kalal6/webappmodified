      "explanation": "The hard palate contains keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, has a submucosa, and \ncontains minor salivary gland. This keratinised stratified squamous epithelium has regional \nvariations and may be orthokeratinised or parakeratinised(found in hard palate and gingiva). The bony structure of the hard palate is covered by a firmly attached mucosa in the central part. \nIn the lateral parts, the hard palate also has a submucosal layer containing blood vessels. There \nare minor mucous type salivary glands in the submucosa in the posterior part of the hard palate. (Note: In the orthokeratinized epithelium the cell nuclei disappear in the keratinized layer, \nwhereas in the parakeratinized epithelium flattened, highly condensed nuclei remain in the cell \ncytoplasm of the keratinized layer until exfoliation)",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, the histological image is likely to be of the endometrium. It shows the \npresence of glycogen masses in the basal cytoplasm of the epithelial cells lining the glands which \nare the features of the early secretory phase of the endometrium. The uterus is made up of an external layer of smooth muscle called the myometrium, and an \ninternal layer called the endometrium. The endometrium has three layers which are namely: • Stratum compactum, • Stratum spongiosum (which make up the stratum functionalis) • Stratum basalis. The changes observed in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle are continuous and may be \nsummarized as follows: • Increase in thickness of endometrium - The endometrium progressively increases in thickness. \nIn the postmenstrual phase, it is 0.5–1 mm thick; in the proliferative phase it is 2–3 mm thick, \nand in the secretory phase, its thickness reaches 5–7 mm. • Increase in dimensions of uterine glands - The uterine glands grow in length. At first, they are \nstraight but gradually become convoluted. Because of these convolutions, the glands acquire a \n'saw-toothed' appearance when seen in the longitudinal section. The glands also increase in 283 \nSold by @itachibot diameter. • Change in the epithelial lining of glands - The epithelium lining the glands is at first cuboidal. \nDuring the proliferative stage, it becomes columnar. Glycogen accumulates in the basal portion of \nthe epithelial cell, pushing the nucleus nearer the lumen. During the secretory phase, the apical \npart of the cell is shed off as part of the secretion and the cell again becomes cubical. Given below is a histological section of the endometrium in the proliferative phase.",

      "explanation": "The image shows an arrow mark pointing towards the cilia. All the structures given in the options \nhave a ciliated lining epithelium except epididymis, which is lined by pseudostratified columnar \nepithelium with stereocilia. The given image is a histological section of the epididymis showing the pseudostratified columnar \nepithelium with stereocilia. 284 \nSold by @itachibot Cilia are minute hair-like projections, while stereocilia are very long, thick microvilli measuring \nabout 5–10 m in length. Ciliated epithelium: • The epithelium bears cilia, which moves in a coordinated fashion, and help in the movement of \nthe mucus, or propel the movement of any other structures such as ova or spermatozoa. • The ciliated columnar epithelium is found in most of the respiratory tract, the uterus, and the \nuterine tube (oviduct), efferent ductules of the testis, parts of the middle ear and auditory tube; \nthe ependyma lining the central canal of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. • The pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium is seen in the trachea and in large bronchi. 285 \nSold by @itachibot Skin & Special Senses, Eye and Ear",
