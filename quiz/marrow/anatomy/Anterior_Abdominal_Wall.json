This is because the \nneurovascular plane of the abdominal wall lies between these two muscles. The plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis contains: • Lower 6 thoracic nerves (T7-12) • Iliohypogastric nerves • Posterior intercostal and subcostal vessels • Anastomosis between superior and inferior epigastric arteries The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique used for \nabdominal surgeries like open cholecystectomy, open appendicectomy, and hernia surgery.

The pyramidalis is a triangle-shaped muscle that runs within the rectus sheath. The base is \nattached to the anterosuperior margin of the pubis and to the ligamentous fibres in front of the \nsymphysis. The apex is attached to the linea alba. It gets its nerve supply from the terminal branches of the subcostal nerve (the ventral ramus of \nT12).
