      "explanation": "Among the given options the given structure is of the capillary. The wall of the capillary is formed mainly by endothelial cells that are lined on the outside by a \nbasal lamina made of glycoprotein. There is no adventitia that differentiates it from a venule. 251 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows the microvessels - arteriole, venule, and capillary. The capillaries can be classified into two types: • Continuous capillaries - The edges of endothelial cells fuse completely with those of adjoining \ncells to form a continuous wall. The exchange of material between the blood and tissue occurs \nthrough the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells or through the intercellular material adjoining the \ncells. • Fenestrated capillaries - The walls of these capillaries have apertures in their endothelial lining \nwhich are closed by a thin diaphragm. The fenestration may also be present as pores, which \npasses through the entire thickness of the cell. The exchange of material occurs by diffusion \nthrough these fenestrae. They are mainly seen in renal glomeruli, intestinal villi, endocrine glands, \nand pancreas. Sinusoids differ from the capillaries in that the wall sinusoid has only endothelium, which is \nsupported by a thin layer of connective tissue. The endothelium has larger deficiencies in the form \nof fenestrations or long slits. 252 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "options": {
        "a": "The fibrous elements present in the tunica intima and media run circularly",
        "b": "The fibrous elements of the tunica adventitia run longitudinally",

        "d": "Collagen fibers are predominantly present in the tunica intima"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The fibrous elements in the intima and the adventitia (mainly collagen) run longitudinally (i.e., \nalong the length of the vessel), whereas those in the media (elastic tissue or muscle) run circularly. The tunica adventitia consists of connective tissue in which collagen fibres are prominent. This \nlayer prevents undue stretching or distension of the artery. Structure of arterial wall: The wall of an artery is made up of three layers, from inside out these include: 1. Tunica intima: • It is the innermost layer and consists of endothelium, which lies on the basal lamina. • Beneath the endothelium, there is a delicate layer of sub-endothelial connective tissue. • A membrane formed by elastic fibers surrounds the basal lamina. This membrane is called the \ninternal elastic lamina. 2. Tunica media: • It consists of smooth muscle or elastic tissue, depending on which there are two types of arteries: \nmuscular artery and elastic artery respectively. • The smooth muscle or elastic tissue is surrounded by a membrane made up of elastic fibers \ncalled, external elastic lamina. 3. Tunica adventitia: • It is the outermost layer and predominantly consists of connective tissue formed by collagen \nfibres. • This layer prevents the artery from being overstretched or excessively distended. 253 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "options": {
        "a": "They are also known as distributing arteries",
        "b": "The internal elastic lamina is distinct from the tunica media",
        "c": "Smooth muscles are absent in the tunica media",
        "d": "The elastic recoil helps in continuous flow of the blood"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The elastic recoil of the elastic arteries helps in continuous blood flow. The large elastic arteries distend and recoil during systole and diastole respectively due to \nabundant elastic tissue. The recoiling acts as an additional force that pushes blood into smaller \narteries. So, blood flows continuously through arteries but with some fluctuation in pressure \nduring systole and diastole. The main differences between the elastic and muscular arteries are shown in the table given \nbelow: Structure \nElastic artery \nMuscular artery The internal elastic lamina is \ndistinct Tunica intima \nThe internal elastic lamina ca \nnnot be distinguished from t \nhe surrounding tunica media Predominantly of smooth mu \nscle cells.Very few elastic fibe \nrs. Tunica media \nPredominantly of elastic fiber \ns.Few smooth muscle cells. Relatively thicker and consist \ns of fibroblastic tissue. Relatively thin and consists \nmainly of elastic fibers Tunica adventiti \na Other options: Option A: The elastic arteries are also known as conducting vessels, as their main function is to \nconduct the blood from the heart, whereas the muscular arteries are known as distributing \nvessels. Option B: The internal elastic lamina in the elastic arteries is not distinct and cannot be \ndifferentiated from the tunica media as the structure of the internal elastic lamina is same as that \nof the elastic fibers present in tunica media of elastic arteries. 254 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: The tunica media of the elastic arteries is predominantly made up of elastic tissue. \nBetween the elastic membranes, there is some loose connective tissue. Some smooth muscle cells \nmay be present.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "255 \nSold by @itachibot The arterioles present in the spleen divide into a number of straight vessels that are \ncalled penicilli. The splenic artery after entering the hilum of the spleen divides into about five branches that \nenter the organ independently. Each branch divides and subdivides as it travels through the \ntrabecular network. Arterioles arising from this network leave the trabeculae to pass into the \ninter-trabecular spaces. The spleen is histologically composed of: • White pulp - For some distance, each arteriole is surrounded by a dense sheath of lymphocytes. \nThese lymphocytes constitute the white pulp of the spleen. • Penicilli - The arteriole then divides into a number of straight vessels that are called penicilli. • Ellipsoid - Each of the penicilli shows a localised thickening of its wall that is called an ellipsoid. \nThe ellipsoid consists of concentric lamellae formed by aggregation of fibroblasts and \nmacrophages. • Ampulla - Distal to the ellipsoid, the vessel dilates to form an ampulla, the walls of which \nbecome continuous with the reticular framework. • Red pulp - As a result, blood flows into spaces lined by reticular cells, coming into direct contact \nwith lymphocytes there. The part of splenic tissue, which is infiltrated with blood in this way is \ncalled the red pulp. • Sinusoids - Blood from spaces of the red pulp is collected by wide sinusoids that drain into veins \nin the trabeculae. Stave cells: The sinusoids of the spleen are lined by a somewhat modified endothelium. The \nendothelial cells here are elongated and are shaped like bananas. They are referred to as stave \ncells.",
