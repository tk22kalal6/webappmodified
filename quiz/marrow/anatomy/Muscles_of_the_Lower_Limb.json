      "explanation": "The sartorius muscle is the longest muscle in the body. It originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts into the superior aspect of the \nmedial surface of the tibial shaft near the tibial tuberosity (joins gracilis and semitendinosus at the \npes anserinus). It flexes and laterally rotates the hip joint and flexes the knee and is innervated by the femoral \nnerve (L2, L3, and L4).",

        "c": "3",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The structure involved in causing lurching gait in the child is gluteus medius (marked as 2). The gluteus medius originates from the outer surface of the ilium between the anterior and \nposterior gluteal lines. Insertion of the muscle is at the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. It \nis supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. Gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of \ngluteus medius and minimus: • When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on \nthe opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action \nresults in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in \nthe upright position. • The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, \nneck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions \nlike paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc. • When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported \n(normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive \nTrendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected \nside with contralateral pelvis drop. 1069 \nSold by @itachibot Other options 1 - Gluteus maximus - involved in the extension of flexed thigh, abduction (only upper fibres), and \nlateral rotation at the hip joint. Insertion is at the iliotibial tract. 3 - Piriformis - involved in lateral rotation and assists abduction at the hip joint. It is inserted into \nthe medial side of greater trochanter of the femur. Entrapment of the sciatic nerve in the \npiriformis can lead to piriformis syndrome. 4 - Sciatic nerve - The nerve passes over the obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus \ninferior and quadratus femoris. It supplies knee flexors and muscles below the knee. Paralysis of \nthis nerve results in flail foot and severe difficulty in walking.",

      "explanation": "The gastrocnemius (two heads) and soleus muscles are collectively known as triceps surae. \nThey constitute a powerful muscular mass whose main function is plantar flexion of the foot. The main bulk of the calf is formed by gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles. These 3 \nmuscles form the superficial flexor group of the posterior compartment of the lower leg.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Dorsiflexion of the foot causes pain in the deep posterior compartment syndrome of the leg. All tibial fractures should be monitored for signs of compartment syndrome. Severe pain is the \nmost important clinical feature. Regular clinical evaluation is important because swelling, \nblistering, and skin necrosis is associated with late, severe compartment syndrome. Compartment syndromes of the lower limb: • Superficial and deep posterior compartment syndrome - There will be pain on passive \ndorsiflexion of the foot and on the toe extension • Anterior compartment syndrome - There will be pain on passive plantar flexion of the foot and \ntoe flexion • Lateral compartment syndrome - There will be pain on passive foot inversion.",

From superficial to deep, the layers \nare numbered from one to four. Muscles of the sole of the foot are: 1st layer: This is the superficial layer which includes abductor hallucis, abductor digiti minimi, \nand flexor digitorum brevis. 2nd layer: It consists of flexor accessorius and the four lumbrical muscles,the tendons of flexor \nhallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus run in the same plane as the muscles of the second \nlayer. 3rd layer: It contains the shorter intrinsic muscles of the toes, which are flexor hallucis brevis, \nadductor hallucis and flexor digiti minimi brevis. 1086 \nSold by @itachibot 4th layer: It consists of plantar and dorsal interossei and the tendons of tibialis posterior and \nfibularis longus. 1087 \nSold by @itachibot Nerves & Vessels of Lower Limb",
