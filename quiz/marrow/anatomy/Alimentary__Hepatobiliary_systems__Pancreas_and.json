Between the allantois and hindgut, a wedge of mesoderm, called the urorectal \nseptum, grows. The urorectal septum divides the endodermal cloaca into two parts: • The primitive urogenital sinus in the anterior part develops into the urinary \nbladder, urethra, and lower part of the vagina (in females) • The primitive rectum in the posterior part develops into the lower part of the rectum and upper \npart of the anal canal.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of gastroschisis. It is caused due to the failure of the body wall to \nclose in the abdominal region during development. Ventral wall defects include: • Gastroschisis: The intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall. The defect \nusually lies to one side of the umbilicus (right side commonly). The loops of the bowel are not \ncovered by amnion as they herniate through the abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. 124 \nSold by @itachibot The affected bowel loops can be damaged by exposure to amniotic fluid. • Omphalocele: The bowel loops fail to return from the physiologic umbilical hernia. Since the \numbilicus is covered by a reflection of the amnion, the omphalocele is also covered by amnion. • Bladder or cloacal exstrophy: Failure of the body wall to close in the pelvic region. Bladder \nexstrophy is less severe of the 2 and only the bladder is exposed in this condition. Cloacal \nexstrophy is more severe and both the bladder and rectum, which are derived from the cloaca, are \nexposed. • Ectopia cordis: Failure of the lateral body wall folds to close in the midline in the thoracic region. \nThis results in the heart remaining outside the thoracic cavity.",

      "explanation": "125 \nSold by @itachibot The condition shown in the image is cloacal exstrophy, which is caused by the failure of the body \nwall to close in the pelvic region. The given image shows the classic feature of cloacal exstrophy, which includes an exstrophic \ncentral bowel area flanked by two hemibladders: • Bladder exstrophy: The bladder is seen turned inside out (exstrophy means turned inside out) \nand visible as 2 hemibladders on either side. • Bowel exstrophy: The central defect is the prolapsed intestinal loop that appears as the elephant \ntrunk deformity. The central bowel field usually contains an ileocecal segment that has prolapsed. • In addition, omphalocele can be noted in the umbilical region in this image. Exstrophy of the bladder or cloaca occurs due to abnormal closure of the body wall in the pelvic \nregion: • Exstrophy of the bladder: The bladder mucosa is exposed to the surface. In male infants, \nepispadias is seen additionally. • Exstrophy of the cloaca: The closure of the ventral body wall is more severely affected than in \nbladder exstrophy. There is the involvement of the bladder and rectum, both of which are derived \nfrom the cloaca. In addition, there is defective development of the urorectal septum leading to \nanal canal malformations and imperforate anus. As the genital swellings are widely separated, \nexternal genitalia will be defective. Cloacal exstrophy can present as part of OEIS syndrome, in which multiple anomalies are seen, \nwhere O stands for Omphalocele, E for Exstrophy of bladder or cloaca, I for Imperforate anus, \nand S for Skeletal anomalies.",

      "explanation": "The spleen develops from the mesoderm in the dorsal mesogastrium. The mesenchymal cells in the dorsal mesogastrium form small lobular masses of splenic tissue \ncalled spleniculi. Later, these lobules fuse to form a single mass of the spleen. The capsule, septa, \nand connective tissue framework, including reticular fibers, develop from mesoderm. The \nmesenchymal cells also differentiate into lymphoblasts and other blood-forming cells. When the spleen develops, the dorsal mesogastrium gets divided into an anterior segment called \ngastrosplenic ligament that extends from the spleen to stomach, and a posterior part called the \nlienorenal ligament that extends from the spleen to the left kidney.",
