      "explanation": "The 8th rib is the false rib because it does not articulate with the sternum anteriorly. • First 7 ribs are true ribs as they are attached anteriorly to the sternum by costal cartilages. • Ribs 8-10 are false ribs as they join the superjacent costal cartilage. • Ribs 11 and 12 are floating ribs as they float freely without costal attachment. 758 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The first sternocostal joint is a type of synarthrosis. Joints are classified in 2 ways: Classification 1 is based on the type of motion (functional): • Synarthrosis - no movement (first sternocostal joint) • Amphiarthrosis - some movement (pubic symphysis) • Diarthrosis - full movement (elbow/shoulder/ankle) Classification 2 is based on the structure of joint: 1. Fibrous • Sutures (joints between skull bones) • Syndesmoses (distal tibiofibular joint) • Gomphose (joint between teeth and teeth sockets in mandibular/maxillary bone) 2. Cartilaginous • Synchondrosis - primary cartilaginous (costochondral joints) • Symphysis - secondary cartilaginous (manubriosternal and xiphisternal joints) 3. Synovial (elbow, knee, hip etc.) 759 \nSold by @itachibot • the presence of these help the thoracic cavity expand during inspiration.

E.g. manubriosternal and xiphisternal joints • Synovial joints - the presence of these help the thoracic cavity expand during inspiration.

Typical ribs: Ribs 3 to 9 are typical. A typical rib is curved, and has a shaft with anterior and posterior ends: • The anterior end has costal cartilage • The posterior end has a head, neck, and a tubercle and articulates with the vertebra at 3 sites as \nfollows: • The head has 2 facets and articulates with the vertebra at 2 sites • The tubercle has articular and nonarticular surfaces.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario and chest X-ray features are suggestive of a tumor at the apex of the right \nlung, also called Pancoast tumor. The thoracic duct does not lie between the 1st rib and the apex \nof the lung, so it will not be compressed. The thoracic duct crosses from right to left in the \nmediastinum at the level of T5 and ascends upwards to drain into the venous system. The structures present between the 1st rib and apex of the lung (medial to lateral) can be \nremembered using the mnemonic SVAN: • Sympathetic trunk • Vein - Posterior intercostal • Artery - Superior intercostal • Nerve - T1 nerve Clinical significance: Pancoast tumors can cause destruction of the first rib by mass effect.
