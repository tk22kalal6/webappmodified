      "explanation": "The ilioinguinal nerve lies outside the internal spermatic fascia of the spermatic cord. Ilioinguinal nerve is not the content of the spermatic cord but it is the content of the inguinal \ncanal. The ilioinguinal nerve lies inferior to the cord in the inguinal canal. It provides innervation \nto the groin and medial aspect of the thigh, the upper part of the scrotum, and the penile \nroot. It may be commonly injured during open hernia repair. The spermatic cord is a structure that passes through the inguinal canal in males. The inguinal \ncanal is a natural passageway between the muscle layers of the anterior abdominal wall in the \nregion of the groin. It transmits the spermatic cord in males, the round ligament of the uterus in \nfemales, and the ilioinguinal nerve in both sexes. The contents of the spermatic cord include: • Cremaster muscle fibers • Testicular artery and pampiniform plexus of veins • Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve • Vas deferens • Cremasteric vessels • Lymphatics • Processus vaginalis Coverings of the spermatic cord from inside to outside are: • Internal spermatic fascia from fascia transversalis • Cremasteric fascia • External spermatic fascia from external oblique aponeurosis 980 \nSold by @itachibot",

The cremasteric artery travels along with the spermatic cord to supply the cremaster muscle and \nother coverings of the cord. When the testicular artery is interrupted, there will be formation of collaterals from the \ncremasteric and deferential arteries. This will prevent the ischemia of the testis. Note: The Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy done for undescended abdominal testis is based on this \ncollateral formation. In the first stage, testicular vessels are clipped laparoscopically to promote \nthe collateral formation along the vas deferens. In the second stage, the testis along with \ncollaterals and vas deferens are mobilized to the scrotum.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The left renal vein is likely to be occluded in this case. The left testicular vein drains into the left \nrenal vein. Occlusion of the left renal vein impedes the blood flow in the left testicular veins. As a \nresult, the veins become swollen and cause pain on the affected side. Venous drainage of the testis: The pampiniform plexus of veins arising from the testes ascend through the inguinal canal and \nabdomen. They coalesce to form the testicular veins during their course. • The left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein at a right angle. • The right testicular vein drains into the inferior vena cava at an acute angle. Clinical note: Varicose dilatation of the veins draining the testis is called varicocele. 90% of the \nvaricocele occurs on the left side and mostly this is due to the absence or incompetence of valves \nin the testicular vein. 984 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The lining epithelium of the fallopian tube is a single layer of ciliated columnar epithelium. It is \nsimilar to the epithelium of the bronchioles. The ciliated epithelial cells are predominant in the distal part of the fallopian tube. There is an \nincrease in the height and number of cilia in these cells during the estrogenic phase of the \nmenstrual cycle. Other cells in the fallopian tube epithelium include: • Secretory or peg cells - maximally located in the proximal portion of the tube. These cells are \nactive around the time of ovulation, and their secretions help in the capacitation of sperms. • Intraepithelial lymphocytes - may present occasionally. Option A: Epithelium of stomach - simple columnar Option B: Epithelium of trachea - Pseudostratified ciliated columnar Option D: Epithelium of proximal convoluted tubule - cuboidal with microvilli.",
