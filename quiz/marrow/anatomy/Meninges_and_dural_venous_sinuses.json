Therefore, an aneurysm of the ICA may impinge on the nerve and may lead to sixth nerve \npalsy. The oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve lie in \nthe lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. They are involved in the pathologies of the sinus much \nlater. The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve does not run through the cavernous sinus or its \nlateral wall.
