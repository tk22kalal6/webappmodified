Adduction of the arm will be intact here, as \nthis action is caused by pectoralis major which is supplied by the medial and lateral pectoral \nnerves. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve affects the movements of the muscles supplied by it. They are: • Trapezius - overhead abduction, elevation, and retraction of scapula. It is tested by asking the \npatient to shrug the shoulders. • Sternocleidomastoid - turning the chin to the opposite side, tilting the head towards the shoulder \nof the same side. When both act together they draw the head forwards. The spinal accessory nerve innervates the sternocleidomastoid just before entering the posterior \ntriangle. • If the nerve is injured before it enters the posterior triangle, actions of the \nsternocleidomastoid will be affected. • If the nerve is injured within the posterior triangle, the sternocleidomastoid will be spared.",
