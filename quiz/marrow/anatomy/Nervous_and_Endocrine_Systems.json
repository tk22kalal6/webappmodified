      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The neurites of the neurons constitute the dendrites and the axon. Neurites or neuronal processes refer to any projection arising from the cell body (soma) of a \nneuron. They are of two types: • Axon - a single, long projection arising from the cell body that carries the impulse away from the \ncell body. The axon ends by dividing into several branches called axon terminals, which synapses \nwith the dendrites of another neuron. An axon may also end in relation to an effector organ such \nas muscle or a gland. It is free of Nissl granules. • Dendrites - multiple short projections arising from the cell body, that carry the nerve impulse \ntowards the neuron. Nissl granules are present here. The neuronal cytoskeleton consists of neurofilaments and microtubules. These are abundantly \nseen in the cell body, dendrites and the axon. The neurofilaments are heteropolymers of proteins \nthat give tensile strength to the axon. Bundles of neurofilaments constitute a neurofibril. \nMicrotubules assist in axonal transport.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "236 \nSold by @itachibot The Nissl-free zone of a neuron from where an axon arises is called an axon hillock. Nissl bodies or granules are aggregates of polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum. They \nare present in the cell body of a neuron and in large dendrites. Under light microscopy, they \nappear as basophilic granules. The affinity towards the basic dyes is due to the presence of a large \namount of RNA which is acidic in nature. The image below shows a photomicrograph of bluish-coloured Nissl bodies (indicated by arrows) \nin the cytoplasm of motor neurons. Option A: The initial segment refers to the proximal part of the axon, that lies just beyond the \naxon-hillock. Thus, an axon-hillock is part of the cell body while the initial segment is part of an \naxon. Option B: Mesaxon refers to the area where the plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with \nitself around the axon. During the formation of the myelin sheath, the axon invaginates the \nSchwann cell. The plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself and continues to wrap 237 \nSold by @itachibot around the axon to form multiple layers of the plasma membrane called the myelin sheath. The \ncytoplasm and nucleus of the Schwann cell are pushed to the periphery. The thin layer of the \ncytoplasm of the Schwann cell surrounding the myelin sheath is called neurilemma. Option D: Each Schwann cell myelinates only a short segment of the axon. Hence, along \nthe length of the axon, there are several Schwann cells myelinating it. The unmyelinated portions \nof the axon present in between myelinated segments are known as nodes of Ranvier.",

      "explanation": "The stain used in this section is osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide is reduced to a black substance by unsaturated fatty acids present in the myelin \nsheath of the nerve fibers and hence, appears black on the section. The pure neuritic form is a variant of leprosy characterized by the isolated involvement \nof peripheral nerve trunks with the absence of skin lesions.

The pituitary gland is divided into the pars anterior, pars intermedia and pars posterior (or pars \nnervosa). The pars anterior (aka pars distalis) consists of chromophil cells and chromophobe cells. The chromophil cells have brightly staining granules in their cytoplasm. They include: 240 \nSold by @itachibot • Acidophil cells - stain with acidic dyes like eosin or orange G and appear pink on H and E \nstain. They are also called alpha cells. They include: • Somatotrophs - producing growth hormone • Lactotrophs - producing prolactin • Basophil cells - stain with basic dyes like hematoxylin and appear blue on H and E stain. These \ncells are also periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain positive. They are also called beta cells. They include: • Corticotrophs - producing ACTH • Thyrotrophs - producing TSH • Gonadotrophs - producing FSH and LH The chromophobe cells do not contain granules that stain and hence appear colorless on an H and \nE stain. The pars intermedia contains colloid filled vesicles, which are remnants of the pouch of Rathke. The pars posterior consists of nerve fibers from the neurons of the hypothalamus and specialized \nsupporting cells called pituicytes.",
