Major morphogenetic events that occur in the pre-embryonic phase include: • Fertilization • Cleavage • Transportation of cleaving zygote • Formation of blastocyst • Implantation • Specialization of primordial embryonic tissue • Differentiation of embryoblast to bilaminar germ disc • Differentiation of trophoblast to cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Fertilization of the ovum commonly occurs in the ampulla of the uterine tube. The ovulated egg enters the infundibulum of the uterine tube and then passes into the ampulla. \nThe sperms released into the female genital tract swim to the ampulla and fertilize the ovum \nthere. Timeline of fertilization: • The ovum released after ovulation is capable of being fertilized for 12-24 hours. • The spermatozoa after ejaculation are capable of fertilization for 24-48 hours. • Fertilization occurs within 1–2 days after ovulation.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The final step of maturation of spermatozoon before fertilization is known as capacitation. Capacitation involves a period of conditioning of the sperm in the female reproductive tract, \npredominantly in the uterine tube. It provides the sperms with the ability to penetrate the outer \nlayer of the ovum. Chemical changes in the tail provide them with greater mobility. It lasts \napproximately 7 hours.",

      "explanation": "Alkaline phosphatase is not an acrosomal enzyme. The three main acrosomal enzymes include: • Acrosin • Hyaluronidase • Acid phosphatase The sperm binds to the zona pellucida through the glycoprotein ligands ZP3 and ZP2 (zona \nproteins). This binding causes the release of the acrosomal enzymes that allow the sperm to \npenetrate the zona pellucida. This is called acrosomal reaction. 24 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Alteration of the properties of the zona pellucida to prevent the entry of other sperms is zona \nreaction. After penetrating the zona, the sperm comes in contact with the oolemma (the plasma membrane \nof the oocyte). This contact results in weak membrane depolarization and a calcium wave. The calcium wave triggers the release of lysosomal enzymes from the cortical granules lining the \noolemma (cortical reaction). These enzymes hydrolyze the ZP3 receptor on the zona \npellucida. Digestion of ZP3 and alteration of zona pellucida (zona reaction) prevents other sperms \nfrom binding, thus creating a block to polyspermy.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy) have mutations in the \nmitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA of all human adult cells are of \nmaternal origin. During fertilization, the sperm's midpiece (with mitochondria) and tail are discarded. The sperm \nnucleus becomes the male pronucleus. Therefore, only the mitochondria present within the \nsecondary oocyte (maternal mitochondria) remain in the fertilized zygote. Mitochondria, \nmitochondrial genetic variations, and mutations are passed only through the female line.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The blastocyst normally implants in the functional layer of the uterine endometrium. 25 \nSold by @itachibot In the secretory phase, three layers can be recognized in the endometrium: stratum compactum, \nstratum spongiosum, and stratum basale. The first two layers (stratum compactum and \nspongiosum) are together known as stratum functionale or the functional layer. If implantation does not occur, the functional layer is shed off during menstruation. If \nimplantation occurs, the functional layer is retained as the decidua. Timeline of implantation: • 3-4 days after fertilization: The morula (12-16 cells) enters the uterus. • 4th day after fertilization: The advanced morula reaches the uterine lumen. • 4-5 days after fertilization: The early blastocyst stage is seen. • 6-7 days after fertilization: The blastocyst implants in the uterus. Implantation corresponds \nto 20-22 days of the menstrual cycle.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The inner cell mass gives rise to the embryoblast, which forms the embryo proper. Around the 4th-5th day of development, the morula becomes the blastocyst. Fluid passes into the \nmorula from the uterine cavity and converts it to a blastocyst with a fluid-filled cavity called \nblastocoele. This fluid partially separates the cells of the inner cell mass from the outer cell mass. Cell masses in the blastocyst: • The outer cell mass is called the trophoblast and forms a major part of the placenta • The inner cell mass is called the embryoblast and forms the embryo proper 26 \nSold by @itachibot",

Events of the pre-embryonic phase of development: • Fertilization • Cleavage - Formation of blastomeres; the cells are loosely arranged until the 8-cell stage. • Compaction - After 3 cleavages, the blastomeres are held together by tight junctions. • Differentiation - The compacted 8-cell stage divides to form a 16-cell morula. • Cavitation - Formation of the blastocyst with inner cell and outer cell mass. • Hatching of the blastocyst - Release of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida. • Implantation - Attachment of developing embryo to the uterine endometrium. • Cell mass differentiation - Differentiation of the embryoblast (inner cell mass) into columnar \nepiblast cells and cuboidal hypoblast cells. • Bilaminar disc formation - Formation of the bilaminar disc suspended by the connecting stalk.

Around the same time, a small amniotic cavity appears within 27 \nSold by @itachibot the epiblast.
