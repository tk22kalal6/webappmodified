      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The formation of the primitive streak from the epiblast is an indicator of the beginning of \ngastrulation. By the 15th day of development, some epiblast cells lying along the central axis, near the tail end \nof the embryonic disc, begin to proliferate. These proliferated cells form an elevation called \nprimitive streak that bulges into the amniotic cavity. Gastrulation is the process that forms all the 3 germ layers namely, ectoderm, mesoderm, and \nendoderm in the embryo. It occurs during the 3rd week of gestation. The image given below shows the formation of primitive streak.",

      "explanation": "Epiblast gives rise to all the 3 germ layers through the process of gastrulation. After the formation of the primitive streak, the epiblast cells migrate toward the primitive streak. \nWhen they arrive at the primitive streak, these cells become flask-shaped, detach from the \nepiblast, and slip beneath the primitive streak. This inward movement is known as invagination. Some of the invaginated epiblast cells displace the hypoblast to create the embryonic endoderm. \nEndoderm is the first germ layer to form. Some of the invaginated cells then start occupying the space between the epiblast and newly \ncreated endoderm to form mesoderm. Cells remaining in the epiblast then form the ectoderm. 36 \nSold by @itachibot The image given below shows the formation of germ layers.",

Notochord formation steps: • Primitive knot - The cranial end of the primitive streak thickens to form the primitive knot \n(primitive node or Hensen's node). • Primitive pit (Blastopore) - A depression appears in the center of the knot known as the \nprimitive pit (or blastopore). • Notochordal process - The cells in the primitive knot multiply and pass cranially in the midline \nbetween the ectoderm and endoderm. They reach up to the caudal margin of the prechordal plate. \nThese cells form a solid chord known as the notochordal process or head process. • Notochordal canal - The cavity of the blastopore then extends into the notochordal process to \nform a tube-like structure called the notochordal canal. • Notochordal plate - The floor of the notochordal canal gets intercalated (mixed up) with the \nendoderm and gradually breaks down. This eventually leads to the formation of a flat plate-like \nstructure notochordal plate. • Definitive notochord - The cells from the notochordal plate proliferate to form a solid rod-like \nstructure called a definitive notochord.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows asymmetrical pigmented lesion on the face with an irregular border. This \nis suggestive of malignant melanoma arising from the melanocytes. Melanocytes are derived from \nneural crest cells (NCC). During neurulation, when the neural folds elevate and fuse, the cells at the lateral border (the \nneural crest) of the neuroectoderm dissociate from their neighboring cells. These neural crest \ncells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition while leaving the neuroectoderm and then \nmigrate to the underlying mesoderm. 39 \nSold by @itachibot NCCs contribute to many organs and tissues and are sometimes referred to as the fourth germ \nlayer: • In the trunk region, they form: • Melanocytes • Sensory ganglia • Sympathetic and enteric neurons • Schwann cells • Adrenal medulla cells • In the cranial region, they contribute to the: • Craniofacial skeleton • Neurons for cranial ganglia • Satellite glial cells • Melanocytes • Some of the other neural crest derivatives are: • C cells of the thyroid gland • Conotruncal septum in the heart • Odontoblasts • Smooth muscle cells to blood vessels to face and forebrain. Option A: Lateral plate mesoderm is the lateral layer of the intraembryonic mesoderm. This is a \nthin layer. This layer develops a large cavity called the intraembryonic cavity and gives rise to a \nsomatic or parietal mesodermal layer and a splanchnic or visceral mesodermal layer. The \nintraembryonic cavity gives rise to pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal cavities. Option B: Intermediate mesoderm is a longitudinal strip of intraembryonic mesoderm that \nconnects paraxial with the lateral plate mesoderm. The urinary and genital systems are derived 40 \nSold by @itachibot from the intermediate mesoderm. Option D: Paraxial mesoderm is the thickened plate of the intraembryonic mesoderm close to the \nmidline, on either side of the notochord. This forms the somitomeres and somites.",

The first pair of \nsomites arise in the occipital region of the embryo at approximately the 20th day of development. 41 \nSold by @itachibot From here, new somites appear in craniocaudal sequence at a rate of approximately 3 pairs per \nday.

      "explanation": "The presence of meconium discharge at the umbilicus is suggestive of vitelline fistula. It occurs \ndue to patent vitelline duct, which connects the primitive gut to the yolk sac. The primitive gut is connected to the definitive yolk sac through a narrow stalk-like \ncommunication known as the vitellointestinal duct. It is also known as vitelline duct or yolk \nstalk or omphalomesenteric duct. 43 \nSold by @itachibot Due to the folding of the embryo in the cephalocaudal and lateral directions, the embryo \ngets enclosed all around by ectoderm, except in the region through which the vitellointestinal duct \npasses. In this region, there is a circular aperture, which is now called the umbilical opening. The \nvitellointestinal duct completely obliterates by the 7th week of development. Vitelline duct abnormalities: • Meckel's diverticulum: In about 2% o the individuals, a portion of the vitelline duct persists an \noutpouching of the ileum called, Meckel diverticulum. The diverticulum is usually asymptomatic \nunless it contains heterotopic pancreatic or gastric mucosa, which may lead to bleeding, \nulceration, or perforation. • Vitelline cyst: In some individuals, both the ends of the vitelline duct transforms into fibrous \ncords. However, the middle portion of the duct forms a large cyst called, enterocystoma, or \nvitelline cyst. As the fibrous cords run across the peritoneal cavity, it may lead to intestinal \nobstruction, strangulation, or volvulus.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The condition shown in the above image is sirenomelia. It is caused due to insufficient formation \nof mesoderm in the caudal most region of the embryo. The mesoderm in the caudal region is involved in the formation of lower limbs, urogenital system, \nand lumbosacral vertebrae. Therefore, the defects seen in this condition include hypoplasia and \nfusion of the lower limbs, vertebral abnormalities, renal agenesis, imperforate anus, and \nanomalies of the genital organs. During the third week of development, a process called gastrulation occurs which leads to the \nformation of all three germ layers. The process begins with the formation of the primitive streak, \nwhich develops into the primitive node and primitive pit. The primitive pit further invaginates \nand organizes itself into cells arranged in three layers, which eventually develop into ectoderm, \nmesoderm, and endoderm. 44 \nSold by @itachibot Gastrulation related abnormalities: Sacrococcygeal teratomas occur due to remnants of pluripotent cells from the primitive streak. \nThey are the most common tumor in newborns, occurring at a frequency of 1 in 37,000 \nbirths. Sacrococcygeal teratomas contain tissues derived from all three germ layers. \nWhen pluripotent cells from the primitive streak remain in the sacrococcygeal region, they \nproliferate to form sacrococcygeal teratomas. Holoprosencephaly is a deficiency in the midline craniofacial structures. It occurs due to \nteratogenic exposure (such as high alcohol dose) during gastrulation which kills the cells in the \nanterior midline of the embryonic disc. In holoprosencephaly, the forebrain is small, the two \nlateral ventricles are often merged into a single ventricle, and the eyes are close together \n(hypotelorism).",
