It passes through the muscular part of the diaphragm anterior to the central \ntendon, just lateral to the left cardiac surface and more anterior than the right phrenic nerve. Structures passing through the esophageal hiatus are: • Esophagus • Vagal trunks • Gastric nerves • Esophageal branches of the left gastric vessels • Some lymphatic vessels Clinical significance: In carcinoma esophagus involving the lower third, the Orringer approach or transhiatal \nesophagectomy is done. The stomach and lower part of esophagus are mobilised via laparotomy \nand the upper part is mobilized via the left side of the neck. Blunt dissection is done at the hiatus \nto approach the thorax from the abdomen. Other alternatives to this procedure are robotic and \nthoracoscopic techniques 813 \nSold by @itachibot",
