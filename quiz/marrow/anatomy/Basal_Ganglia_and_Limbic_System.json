      "options": {
        "a": "Caudate nucleus and globus pallidus",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Sydenham's chorea, a complication of rheumatic fever. \nThe choreic movements are caused by the destruction of D2 neurons of the striatum. The \nneostriatum consists of the caudate nucleus and putamen. The image given below shows Sydenham's chorea in a patient. Nomenclature of basal ganglia: • Corpus striatum: Caudate nucleus + putamen+ globus pallidus • Lentiform nucleus: Putamen + globus pallidus • Neostriatum: Caudate nucleus + putamen 387 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Parkinson's disease, a disorder involving the \ndestruction of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia. The most accurate representation of the \ndirect pathway in the basal ganglia is cortex &gt; striatum &gt; globus pallidus&gt; thalamus &gt; \npremotor cortex. Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is clinically \nmanifested by a triad of cardinal motor symptoms- rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor. The indirect pathway is represented as follows: Cortex &gt; Striatum &gt; Globus pallidus externa &gt; Subthalamic nucleus &gt; Globus pallidus \ninterna and Substantia nigra reticulata &gt;Thalamus &gt; Premotor cortex The direct pathway stimulates the cortex to produce movement and the indirect pathway inhibits \nmovement.",

      "explanation": "A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus causes sudden, violent, involuntary movements confined to \none side of the body, commonly affecting the proximal extremity musculature, a condition \ncalled hemiballismus. The movements are seen contralateral to the side of the lesion, i.e., \ninvoluntary movements of the right arm and leg are seen in the lesion of the left subthalamic \nnucleus and vice versa.",
