They surround \nthe circumference of the orbit and spread into the adjascent regions. It has orbital, palpebral and \nlacrimal parts. It plays an important role in modulating facial expression and various ocular \nreflexes. It mainly closes the eyelids. It is supplied by branches of the facial, superficial temporal, maxillary and ophthalmic arteries. It \nis innervated by the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve. 498 \nSold by @itachibot",

Dorello's canal is an interdural space limited superiorly by the petrosphenoidal ligament, laterally \nby the petrous apex, and medially by the dorsum sellae. This is a confluence of superior petrosal, \ninferior petrosal, cavernous sinus, and basilar plexus venous sinuses.
