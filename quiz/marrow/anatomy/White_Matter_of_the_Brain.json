The thalamus lies medial \nto the posterior limb of the internal capsule and is most likely to be affected in this patient. The internal capsule separates the thalamus and the caudate nucleus from the lentiform nucleus \n(globus pallidus + putamen). It is V-shaped in horizontal section and is divided into the anterior \nlimb, genu, posterior limb, retrolenticular part, and sublenticular part.

The majority of corticonuclear fibers cross in the median plane before supplying the cranial nerve \nnuclei. All cranial motor nuclei receive bilateral corticonuclear connections except, facial nucleus \nsupplying the lower part of the face and the hypoglossal nucleus supplying the genioglossus 380 \nSold by @itachibot muscle. Hence, a lesion of these fibers causes contralateral clinical manifestations. Option A: Anterior limb of the internal capsule carries fronto-pontine fibers. A lesion here \nproduces confusion, impaired attention, agitation, and dysarthria. Option C: Posterior limb of the internal capsule carries cortico-spinal motor fibers in the anterior \npart and a lesion here produces contralateral hemiparesis. The posterior part of the posterior limb \nof the internal capsule carries sensory fibers and lesions here may produce contralateral \nhemi-sensory deficits.",
