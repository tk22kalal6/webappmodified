      "explanation": "Couinaud's segments are divided based on the distribution of the portal vein. Veins of the liver: • Portal vein- collects the blood from the gall bladder, pancreas, and spleen, and abdominal part of \nthe alimentary tract. It transfers the blood collected from these organs to the liver. • Hepatic vein- collects the de-oxygenated blood from the liver. It directly drains into the inferior \nvena cava and ultimately into the heart. Note: Left hemihepatectomy involves the resection of segments II, III, and IV. Right \nhemihepatectomy involves the resection of segments V, VI, VII, and VIII.",

The entire anterior surface of the body is covered by peritoneum and \nthe tail lies between the layers of the splenorenal ligament, which is formed from the peritoneum. Note that the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ(except for the tail), in that it is not enveloped \nwith the peritoneum but the anterior surface is in contact with the peritoneum.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Pancreas divisum has been depicted in the image marked 3. The pancreas has two ducts which normally fuse during embryologic development: • The accessory (dorsal) pancreatic duct (of Santorini) drains the upper part of the anterior portion \nof the pancreatic head. • The main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) usually runs within the substance of the gland from left \nto right. When the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together, it results in pancreas divisum. In this \ncondition, the majority of the pancreas drains via a dominant dorsal duct that enters the \nduodenum at the minor papilla. A short ventral duct, along with the bile duct, drains into the \nmajor duodenal papilla. Therefore, the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct \nwhich opens up into the minor papilla. Patients with this condition are usually asymptomatic, however, 25-38% of these patients \nexperience recurrent pancreatitis that may further progress to chronic pancreatitis. Image A: Normal pancreatic ducts with communication between main and accessory ducts. Image B: Normal pancreatic ducts and no communication between main and accessory ducts. Image D: Absence of accessory pancreatic duct. 939 \nSold by @itachibot KUB & Adrenal Gland",
