      "explanation": "The clavicle is the first bone to ossify in the human body. It occurs by the 5th- 6th weeks of \nintrauterine life. The clavicle is a band of condensed mesenchyme in the early embryonic phase. At the terminal ends of this band, early cartilage transformation (pre-cartilage) takes place. \nIntramembranous centers of ossification appear and fuse in the mesenchyme between them. \nHence, it ossifies partly in the membrane and partly in cartilage.",

It is also where the transition \nfrom antecurve to retro curve begins and is prone to be at high risk for fractures.

      "explanation": "Teres major has no role in maintaining the stability of the shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint. Since the head of the humerus is larger than the \nglenoid cavity, it is often prone to displacement. However, the stability of the shoulder joint is \nprovided by the following: • Rotator cuff: It is formed by blending of tendons of 4 muscles (SITS)- • Supraspinatus • Infraspinatus • Teres minor • Subscapularis • Tendon of the long head of biceps: It passes over the head of the humerus and prevents upward \ndisplacement. • Coracoacromial ligament Degeneration or tear of the above structures leads to instability of the shoulder joint. 631 \nSold by @itachibot The shoulder joint is least protected inferiorly.

When the arm is abducted without rotation, the greater tubercle comes in contact with the \ncoracoacromial arch, preventing further abduction. If the arm is then laterally rotated 180°, the tubercles are rotated posteriorly and the more \narticular surface becomes available to continue elevation. Hence, the range of abduction is \nincreased.",
