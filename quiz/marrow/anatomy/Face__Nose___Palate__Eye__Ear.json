      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Zygomatic prominence is not an embryological structure that contributes to the formation of the \nface. The face is derived from the following structures around the stomatodeum (primitive mouth): • Mandibular prominences and maxillary prominences of the first arch • Frontonasal prominence formed by the proliferation of mesenchyme ventral to the brain \nvesicles. It also gives rise to medial and lateral nasal prominences.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The upper lip is formed by the fusion of the two maxillary prominences with the two medial nasal \nprominences. Initially, two thickenings called nasal placodes are formed in the frontonasal prominence. The \nnasal placodes get depressed to become nasal pits. Each nasal pit has a ridge of tissue on the outer \nedge called lateral nasal prominence and on the inner edge called medial nasal prominence. The 2 maxillary prominences on the lateral part of the stomodeum increase in size and grow \nmedially. They compress the medial nasal prominences toward the midline. Later, the 2 maxillary \nprominences fuse with the 2 medial nasal prominences to form the upper lip.",

      "explanation": "The image shows cleft lip which occurs when the maxillary prominences fail to fuse with the \nmedial nasal prominences. Various defects of fusion of prominences in the face region are as follows: A cleft lip is due to the failure of the fusion of maxillary prominence with medial nasal \nprominence. It can be unilateral or bilateral. It can vary in severity from a small notch in the \nupper lip to a double cleft extending into both the nostrils. There is also associated \nunderdevelopment of the part of the maxilla that bears the incisors. Median (midline) cleft lip is a rare defect occurring due to failure of the two medial nasal \nprominences to fuse in the midline. 139 \nSold by @itachibot The oblique facial cleft is caused by the failure of the maxillary prominence to fuse with the lateral \nnasal prominence along the line of the nasolacrimal groove. The nasolacrimal duct is exposed to \nthe surface in these cases.",

      "explanation": "Bilateral complete cleft palate is due to the non-fusion of palatine processes with the premaxilla \nand with each other. The palate is formed from two main structures: • Primary palate: The small triangular anterior part of the palate is formed by the fused medial \nnasal processes (intermaxillary segment or premaxilla). • Secondary palate: The main part of the palate is formed by the 2 palatine processes that \nconverge from the maxillary processes. The cleft palate can occur in the primary palate (anterior cleft) or in the secondary palate \n(posterior palate). • Complete cleft palate involves both the primary and secondary palate. • Incomplete cleft palate involves only the secondary palate. In bilateral complete cleft palate, a Y-shaped cleft is seen with gaps between the primary and \nsecondary palate and between the two halves of the secondary palate. In addition, there is a \nbilateral cleft upper lip.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The condition coloboma of the iris occurs due to failure of the choroid fissure to close in the distal \npart forming a cleft. There is a small gap in the inferior surface of the optic cup known as the choroid fissure. This \nfissure allows the hyaloid vessels to reach the inner chamber of the eye. During the normal \ndevelopment of the eye, the distal part of the hyaloid artery degenerates. The choroid fissure then \nfuses and this makes the mouth of the optic cup into a round opening (the future pupil). Failure of fusion of choroid fissure causes clefts in the eye known as coloboma. • If the failure to fuse is in the distal part, it can result in coloboma of the iris. • If the failure of fusion occurs in the proximal part, it can lead to coloboma of the retina/ choroid/ \noptic nerve, depending on the location of the defect. 142 \nSold by @itachibot",
