      "explanation": "The branches of the third part of the axillary artery supply the surgical neck of the humerus. \nThrombus in this part will cause decreased supply in its branches - the anterior and posterior \ncircumflex humeral arteries. Branches of 3rd part of the axillary artery are: • Anterior circumflex humeral arteries • Posterior circumflex humeral arteries • Subscapular artery (not involved in the anastomosis) Fracture of the surgical neck is the commonest site among all proximal humerus fractures due to \nits inherent weakness. Fracture at this site may cause injury to the posterior circumflex humeral 741 \nSold by @itachibot artery and the axillary nerve that accompanies it. Positional compression of the axillary artery is seen in athletes who are involved with throwing \nmovement, as in baseball players. Repeated movement of the humerus may cause compression of \nthe distal part of the axillary artery. This may lead to thrombosis or aneurysm resulting in arm \nischemia.",

In such cases, the modified Allen's test is 744 \nSold by @itachibot performed on the other hand, which is likely to have a normal circulation. The integrity of the arcuate system of the hand is assessed by modified Allen's test which is \nperformed routinely before instrumentation of the radial artery. The test determines the integrity between superficial and deep palmar arches and the patency of \nthe radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist. Each one of the arteries is compressed at a time. The \nindividual artery which is sufficient to maintain the arterial supply to the hand in isolation is \nnoted. Procedure: • The patient makes a tight fist, examiner digitally compresses both ulnar and radial arteries. • The patient opens the fist to reveal the pale palm. • Ulnar artery compression is removed, palm turns red including the thumb \nzone (positive modified Allen's test). • If blood fails to return to the palm including the thumb zone, it reveals the anastomosis between \nthe 2 palmar arches is inadequate (negative modified Allen's test). If the hand does not flush within 5–15 seconds (modified Allen's test negative), it indicates that \nulnar circulation is inadequate or nonexistent. In this situation, the radial artery supplying arterial \nblood to that hand should not be punctured.",
