      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The structure marked is the lacunar ligament. Lacunar (Gimbernat's) ligament - It is a thick triangular band of tissue formed from fibres of the \nmedial end of the inguinal ligament and fascia lata. It forms the medial wall of the femoral canal. \nThe apex of the triangle is attached to the pubic tubercle. Inguinal (Poupart’s) ligament - The thick external oblique aponeurosis stretched between ASIS \n(anterior superior iliac spine) and pubic tubercle. Pectineal (Astley-Cooper's) ligament - A strong fibrous band that extends laterally along the \npectineal line from the pectineal attachment of the lacunar ligament. Conjoint tendon - It is a condensation of tissue that runs through the lateral edge of the lower \nrectus sheath. It is formed from the common aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle and \ntransverse abdominis muscle. The fibers turn inferiorly and insert into the crest of the pubis at the \npectineal line immediately deep to the superficial inguinal ring. 1004 \nSold by @itachibot 1005 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The fibers of the iliopubic tract fan out with fascia iliaca laterally. The iliopubic tract is a thickening of the transversalis fascia lying immediately posterior to the \ninguinal (Poupart's) ligament. It extends from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) \nsuperolaterally and arches across the front of the femoral sheath. Attachments: • Medially, its fibres insert by a broad attachment into the pubic tubercle and pectineal line, \nbehind the conjoint tendon. • Laterally, its fibres fan out within the fascia transversalis and fascia iliaca without bony \nattachment to the iliac spines.

It is composed of three separate paired \nmuscles: • Pubococcygeus - this starts from the posterior part of the pubis and runs lateral to the urethra \nand it' spinchter while passing through the pelvic floor. • Puborectalis - This muscle starts from the ischiopubic rami and runs medial to pubococcygeus \nand iliococcygeus to terminate posterior to the rectum at anorectal junction. • Iliococcygeus - This muscle is placed posterior most as a triangular musculotendinous sheet \nwhere the apex is attached to the tip of the ischial spine and the base is attached to the lateral \nmargin of coccyx and the fifth sacral segment. 1010 \nSold by @itachibot",
