      "explanation": "The cytoplasm and nucleus together are referred to as protoplasm. A cell is surrounded by a cell membrane (or plasma membrane), which encloses a complex \nmaterial called protoplasm. It consists of a central, denser part called the nucleus, and an outer \nless dense part called the cytoplasm. The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane, which \nencloses chromatin, nucleolus, and nucleoplasm. The cytoplasm consists of \ncell organelles and cytosol (also called hyaloplasm), which is the liquid component of the \ncytoplasm present outside the cell organelles. Vacuoplasm refers to the fluid-filled spaces enclosed \nwithin the membrane-bound cell organelles.",

      "explanation": "With respect to the mass ratio, the cell membrane predominantly consists of proteins. The mass of proteins either equals or exceeds the mass of lipids in nearly all membranes. Most \nplasma membranes consist of approximately 50% lipid and 50% protein by weight. The lipid \nmolecules in the cell membrane are predominantly phospholipids. The trilaminar structure of \nmembranes is produced by the arrangement of lipid molecules. Each phospholipid molecule \nconsists of an enlarged head with a phosphate portion and two thin tails. The head end is also \ncalled the polar end, while the tail end is the non-polar end. The head end is soluble in water and \nis said to be hydrophilic. The tail end is insoluble in water and is said to be hydrophobic. 189 \nSold by @itachibot",

The fibers of connective tissue are of three main types. These include: • Collagen fibers • Reticular fibers • Elastic fibers The staining characters of each of these fibers are as follows: The image below shows reticular fibers in reticular connective tissue, stained black with silver \nimpregnation method.

Due to this \naffinity to silver salts, they are also known as argentophil fibres. 211 \nSold by @itachibot Reticular fibres are mainly found in: • All lymphoid organs like spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow (except thymus). • Glands, liver and kidneys. • The basement membrane of all epithelia. • Smooth muscle and nerve cells. 212 \nSold by @itachibot Bone, Cartilage & Muscular Tissue",
