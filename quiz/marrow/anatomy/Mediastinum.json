      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of obstruction of the superior vena cava. It does not pierce \nthe pericardium at the level of 3rd costal cartilage. The superior vena cava pierces the pericardium opposite 2nd costal cartilage (angle of \nLouis/sternal angle), at the level of T4-T5 intervertebral disc. It also receives the azygous vein \nabout 2 cm below the sternal plane at the level of T5 vertebra. It enters the right atrium at the level of the 4th intercostal space. Superior vena cava syndrome: 800 \nSold by @itachibot Obstruction of superior vena cava due to metastatic cancers (eg. lung cancer, breast cancer, etc.) \ncan result in reduced venous return from head and neck and upper extremities. It presents with \nswelling of the neck and face, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, and hemoptysis. Symptoms are \naggravated by bending forwards. On examination, the following may be seen • Dilated neck veins • Proptosis • Papilledema • Increased collateral veins on the anterior chest wall - flow is completely downward CT-chest shows an absence or reduction of the opacification of the central veins and the presence \nof prominent collateral venous circulation.",

      "explanation": "The thoracic duct usually originates at the level of the L1 vertebra. The thoracic duct usually originates anterior to L1 or L2 vertebra. It is formed when the intestinal \nand two lumbar lymph trunks join to form cisterna chyli which continues as the thoracic duct. Course: It passes through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm and enters the posterior \nmediastinum lying to the right between the aorta and the azygos vein up till T4-T5 vertebra. It \nthen crosses over to the left side posterior to the esophagus. It continues upwards in the superior \nmediastinum and arches over the subclavian artery and descends anteriorly to drain into the \nconfluence of the left jugular vein and left subclavian vein. It receives lymph from both halves of the body below the diaphragm and only the left half of the \nhead and neck, upper limb, and thorax. 801 \nSold by @itachibot",

Clinical note: 803 \nSold by @itachibot In gastric cancer, metastasis to the left supraclavicular lymph node causes its enlargement, and it \nis known as Virchow's node. The Virchow's node is closely related to the thoracic duct at the site \nwhere it drains into the venous system, therefore its enlargement can mechanically obstruct the \nthoracic duct.",
