      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the given case scenario of an inhaled foreign body, it is most likely to lodge into the right \nbronchus. The right bronchial veins drain to the azygos vein. Left bronchial veins drain into the accessory hemiazygos vein or left superior intercostal vein. Clinical significance: The right principal bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical. This is why an inhaled foreign \nbody is more likely to lodge there. Also, the tracheal bifurcation directs the foreign body to the \nright lung",
