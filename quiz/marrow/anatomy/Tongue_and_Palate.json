      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The anterior 2/3rds of the tongue is demarcated from the posterior 1/3rd by the terminal sulcus, \nalso known as the sulcus terminalis. Sulcus terminalis divides the tongue into anterior and posterior parts. The anterior or the oral \npart faces superiorly and the posterior or the pharyngeal part faces posteriorly. Option A: Sigmoid sulcus is present on the mastoid surface of the temporal bone Option B: Gingival sulcus is present between the tooth and the surrounding gingival tissue Option D: Median sulcus is the central sulcus present on the tongue",

Location of papillae in the tongue: • Filiform papillae - They are minute cylindrical or conical projections that are mainly present on \nthe dorsal part of the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. • Fungiform papillae - They are large, rounded and red in colour and are mainly present on the \nlingual margins and also on the dorsal surface of the tongue. 587 \nSold by @itachibot • Foliate papillae - They are red, leaf-like mucosal ridges that are present bilaterally in two zones \nat the sides of the tongue near the sulcus terminalis. • Circumvallate papillae - They are large cylindrical structures that are around 8-12 in number. \nThey are arranged in a V-shaped row immediately in front of the sulcus terminalis (not on the \nsides of the tongue).",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given image shows tongue deviation to the left, and the left genioglossus muscle is \nparalyzed in the above given clinical scenario. Actions of genioglossus muscle: • When both the right and left genioglossi contract, they protrude the anterior part of the tongue \nout of the mouth in the midline. When only one muscle contracts, it protrudes and pushes the \ntongue to the opposite side. • It depresses the central part of the tongue. • It is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. In conditions affecting the hypoglossal nerve, the genioglossus muscle on that side is paralyzed. In \nsuch cases, when the patient protrudes the tongue, it deviates towards the affected side due to the 588 \nSold by @itachibot muscle contraction on the normal side. The genioglossi are attached to the genial tubercle present on the mandible. This prevents the \ntongue from falling backwards and obstructing respiration. Hence this muscle is known as the \nsafety muscle of the tongue.",

      "explanation": "The submental lymph node will be biopsied first as it is the sentinel lymph node. The sentinel \nnode is the first node that the tumor site drains into. In squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, submental lymph nodes are involved in lesions of the \ntip and submandibular lymph nodes are involved in lesions of the sides of the tongue.

General sensation from most of the soft palate is carried by: • Lesser palatine nerve (a branch of the maxillary nerve) • Pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve • Plexus around the tonsil (formed by tonsillar branches of the glossopharyngeal and lesser \npalatine nerves) Taste sensation from the oral surface of the soft palate is carried by the lesser palatine nerve. The \ntaste fibers initially travel in the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve) and pass \nthrough the pterygopalatine ganglion without synapsing. All the muscles of the soft palate are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus (CN X), except for tensor \nveli palatini, which is supplied by the mandibular nerve. The hard palate is supplied by the greater palatine and nasopalatine branches of the \npterygopalatine ganglion.",
