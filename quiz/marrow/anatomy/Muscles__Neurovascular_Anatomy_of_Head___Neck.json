It is associated with the extreme opening of mouth such as yawning, \nlaughing, vomiting or dental treatment. Some fibres of the upper head of the lateral pterygoid are inserted into the capsule of the TMJ and \nto the anterior and medial borders of the articular disc. Hence, its contraction can exert forward \ntraction on the disc, allowing for jaw protrusion and in extreme cases, the anterior displacement \nof the TMJ. Superior and posterior dislocations of TMJ are rare and is associated with high-energy trauma. 535 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of Frey's syndrome which involves the auriculotemporal \nnerve, marked as 2. Other structures marked are: 1 - Maxillary nerve 3 - Posterior auricular nerve 4 - Inferior alveolar nerve The auriculotemporal nerve is identified by its two roots which encircle the middle meningeal \nartery. It is a branch from the posterior division of the mandibular nerve. It gives cutaneous \ninnervation to the tragus and the adjoining part of the auricle and carries postganglionic \nsecretomotor fibers to the parotid gland. Frey's syndrome is caused due to aberrant regeneration of the postganglionic parasympathetic \nnerve fibers of the auriculotemporal nerve. The nerve fibres regenerate into the nearby sweat \nglands. It can occur following parotid surgery, or any trauma where there is an injury to the \nparotid capsule. This results in sweating, warmth, and redness of the face during the salivary \nstimulation by the smell or taste of food. Hence, Frey's syndrome is also known as gustatory \nsweating or auriculotemporal syndrome. 539 \nSold by @itachibot",

The temporomandibular joint is adapted to accommodate both sliding and rotation movement in \na sagittal plane.

The tensor tympani and the stapedius are the muscles of the middle ear and they are innervated \nby branches of V and VII cranial nerves respectively. Both these muscles contract in response to \nloud noises and thereby dampen sound. The tensor tympani increases the tension of the tympanic \nmembrane and reduces the force of vibration.

      "explanation": "The involvement of the pterygoid canal can injure the vidian nerve, which is formed by: • Postganglionic sympathetic fibres of the deep petrosal nerve • Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres of the greater petrosal nerve Pterygoid canal (Vidian canal): • The pterygoid canal, also known as the Vidian canal, is a foramen in the base of the skull, \nlocated in the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, superior to the pterygoid plates, and \ninferomedial to the foramen rotundum. It transmits the Vidian artery and Vidian nerve from the \nmiddle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa 551 \nSold by @itachibot • It transmits the artery, nerve, and vein of the pterygoid canal (Vidian nerve and Vidian artery) \ninto the pterygopalatine fossa. • The vidian nerve contains the preganglionic fibers of the pterygopalatine ganglion, which \nprovide the secretomotor supply to the nasal mucous glands. Hence vidian neurectomy is \nindicated in vasomotor rhinitis and intractable rhinnorrhea which is refractory to other \ntreatments.",
