      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Epidural anaesthesia is given during labour and the placement is usually preferred below L1 to \navoid injury to the spinal cord. This is because the adult spinal cord terminates at the lower \nborder of the L1 vertebra. In children, it usually terminates at the upper border of the L3 vertebra. Note: Coverage from dermatomes T10 to S1 is necessary for epidural analgesia during labor. For a \ncesarean section, a block from T4 to S1 is needed. However, since the spinal cord ends at the \nlower border of L1 in most adults, epidural analgesia is given below this level.",

The longitudinal arteries are: Anterior spinal artery supplies anterior 2/3rd of the cord. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery \ncauses- • Bilateral paraplegia below the level of lesion due to damage to bilateral corticospinal tracts. • Bilateral thermoanesthesia and analgesia below the level of lesion due to damage to bilateral \nspinothalamic tracts. • Weakness of limb muscles due to damage to bilateral anterior grey horns in cervical or lumbar \nregions of the cord. • Loss of bowel and bladder functions due to damage to the descending autonomic tracts. • Sense of position, vibration, and fine touch are intact as the posterior white column is \nunaffected, which is supplied by the posterior spinal artery. Posterior spinal arteries supplies posterior 1/3rd of the cord.

The anterior spinal artery (ASA) is augmented by numerous radicular arteries. The most \nprominent of these is the artery of Adamkiewic™. It originates from the aorta in the lower thoracic \nor upper lumbar vertebral levels and has the following course: Aorta - posterior intercostal artery - radicular artery - artery of Adamkiewic™ - anastomosis with \nthe anterior spinal artery(ASA).
