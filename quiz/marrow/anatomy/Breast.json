        "a": "It is a modified sweat gland",
        "b": "It lies on the deep pectoral fascia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The nipple is supplied by the anterior branch of the lateral cutaneous branch of T4 (4th intercostal \nnerve). 660 \nSold by @itachibot The breast is innervated by anterior and lateral branches of the 4th to 6th intercostal \nnerves (sensory and sympathetic efferent). The breast (mammary gland) is a modified sweat gland. It lies on the deep pectoral fascia \noverlying the pectoralis major muscle. It is supplied by the internal thoracic artery, lateral \nthoracic artery, and lateral branches of posterior intercostal arteries.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The axillary tail of Spence is the axillary process of the mammary gland. It passes through the \nforamen of Langer. Foramen of Langer is an opening in the deep fascia through which the superolateral quadrant is \nprolonged towards the axilla. It lies along the inferolateral edge of the pectoralis major and may \nextend through the deep fascia up to the apex of the axilla.",

The blood supply of the breast: 4 major sources Artery \nArea suppli \ned Lateral thoracicartery \nLateral Medial Medial mammary branches o \nfinternal thoracicartery 661 \nSold by @itachibot Artery \nArea suppli \ned Pectoral branches of theacro \nmiothoracicandSuperior thor \nacicarteries Superior 2ndto 4thposterior intercosta \nlarteries Base The veins of the breast correspond with the arteries, draining into the axillary and internal \nthoracic veins. Note: The left internal mammary artery (left internal thoracic artery) is the preferred vessel for \ncoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) because it has superior short- and long-term patency rates \ncompared to saphenous vein grafts.",

      "question": "Question 4: Which of the following statement about breast tissue is false?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Fibrous stroma is absent beneath the areola",
        "b": "Alveolar epithelium is columnar in the resting phase",
        "c": "15-20 lactiferous ducts open in the nipple",
        "d": "Myoepitheliocytes facilitates the passage of the milk along the ducts"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Alveolar epithelium is cuboidal in the resting phase, and columnar during lactation. The fibrous stroma forms septa (suspensory ligaments of Cooper) which anchor the skin and \ngland to the pectoral fascia. It forms the major part of the gland but is absent beneath the areola \nand nipple. In the development of breasts, the thoracic ectodermal ingrowths branch into 15–20 solid buds of \nectoderm that will become the lactiferous ducts and their associated lobes of alveoli in the fully \nformed. Contraction of myoepitheliocytes facilitates the passage of the milk along the ducts. The \nlactiferous ducts are arranged in a radial fashion and converge towards the nipple and form \nlactiferous sinuses. 662 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Mammary gland cells secrete milk protein casein by merocrine secretion. Milk lipid is secreted \nby apocrine secretion. Types of glands: • Exocrine • Endocrine Exocrine glands: The secretions are initially packaged into membrane-bound vesicles. These are \nthen conveyed to the cell surface. • Merocrine: It is the most common type. Vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and secrete on \nthe surface. e.g. sweat glands, protein in mammary gland, pancreas, salivary gland. • Apocrine: Apical portion is pinched off for secretion. e.g. milk fat in the mammary gland, \natypical sweat glands, ceruminous glands, glands of Moll. • Holocrine: Entire gland disintegrates to liberate secretion. e.g. sebaceous gland. • Eccrine: Active transportation from plasma as exudate. E.g., previously sweat gland was eccrine, \nnow moved under merocrine. 663 \nSold by @itachibot Endocrine glands: Direct secretion into connective tissue interstitium and then into the \ncirculation.",

      "question": "Question 6: A 58-year-old woman was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the superolateral quadrant of \nthe breast. A blue dye was injected to map the sentinel lymph node for evaluation of \nmetastasis. Which of the following lymph nodes would most likely be removed for biopsy?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Lymphatics from the upper outer quadrant of the breast drain first into the anterior axillary \nlymph nodes (sentinel nodes). A sentinel node is the first lymph node that receives lymphatic drainage from the tumor. It is \nidentified so that it can be removed during the surgery. The lymph node is sent for \nhistopathological analysis to detect metastasis. The axillary nodes receive more than 75% of the lymph from the breast. 664 \nSold by @itachibot Surgical classification of nodes: Nodes are described in relation to pectoralis minor: • Level 1 (Low nodes) - below pectoralis minor • Level 2 (Middle nodes) - behind the muscle • Level 3 (Apical/upper nodes) - between the upper border of the pectoralis minor and the lower \nborder of the clavicle There may be nodes between pectoralis minor and major; this interpectoral group of nodes is also \nknown as Rotter’s nodes.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given image shows the peau d'orange appearance of the breast. It occurs due to the blockade \nof sub-dermal lymphatics. It is one of the most conspicuous signs of breast cancer. The lymphatic blockade gives rise to edema in the breast. However, the swelling is restricted \nwherever the skin is tethered to the ligaments of Cooper. This deepens the openings of the sweat \nglands and hair follicles, giving rise to the typical orange peel appearance. 665 \nSold by @itachibot Brachial Plexus and Nerves",
