      "explanation": "The fascia around the axillary vessels and brachial plexus is called the axillary sheath. It is derived \nfrom the prevertebral fascia. Clinical correlation: • In a brachial plexus nerve block, the axillary sheath localizes the anesthetic solution to the nerve \nplexus. • Chronic retropharyngeal abscess in TB may spread to the axilla or to the superior mediastinum. \nBut it never spreads to the posterior mediastinum because prevertebral fascia fuses to restrict the \nspread.",
