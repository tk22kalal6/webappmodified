      "explanation": "Zona orbicularis is related to the neck of femur. They are the circular fibers of the capsule of hip \njoint. Capsule of the hip joint is made up of 2 sets of fibers: • Circular fibers or zona orbicularis - They are internal and form a collar around the neck of \nfemur. They are blended with the pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments • Longitudinal fibers - They are external. These fibers are numerous in the anterosuperior region \nand are joined by iliofemoral ligament. The image given below shows the zona orbicularis.",
