      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Horner's or Bernard-Horner's syndrome. It can be \ncaused by the lesion of the white ramus of T1. Horner's syndrome is characterized by a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid \n(ptosis), and an absence of sweating of the face (anhidrosis). It occurs due to the disruption of the \nsympathetic nerve supply. 677 \nSold by @itachibot In the autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic plexus is thoracolumbar and \nthe parasympathetic plexus is craniosacral. The sympathetic plexus is formed along the side of the spinal cord by white ramus inflow \n(preganglionic nerve fibers) and gray ramus outflow (postganglionic) and it extends from T1-L2. In Horner's syndrome, since the sympathetic inflow is disrupted, the white ramus of the spinal \ncord is affected as shown below. The difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglions are tabulated below.

The course of the radial nerve: • It is the largest branch of the brachial plexus (C5, 6, 7,8, T1). • It leaves the axilla by passing through the lower triangular space. • It enters the arm and runs along the radial groove with profunda brachii artery. It gives the \nfollowing branches: • Lower lateral cutaneous nerve of arm • Posterior cutaneous nerve of forearm • Branch to lateral head of triceps • Branch to medial head of triceps • Branch to anconeus • In the forearm, it divides in to 2 branches superficial (sensory) and deep (motor) branch at the \ncubital fossa. • Superficial branch crosses the tendon of brachioradialis and goes posterior to supply dorsum of \nthe hand. • Deep branch/ posterior interroseous nerve pierces the supinator and supplies the extensors in \nthe forearm. 692 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, there is a likely injury to the posterior interosseous nerve. It is prone to be injured in radial head fractures as the nerve winds around the radial neck to go \ninto the posterior compartment of the forearm. There is no cutaneous sensory loss in lesions \nconfined to the posterior interosseous nerve. The radial nerve divides into 2 branches, namely superficial (sensory) and deep (motor) branches \nat the cubital fossa. Deep radial nerve after supplying extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and supinator, continues \nas posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). From the posterior compartment, the supinator muscle \nwraps around the upper 1/3rd of the radius to reach the anterior compartment. PIN arches and winds around the radial neck along with the supinator muscle, into the posterior \ncompartment of the forearm. Hence, it is in close relation with the radial head and neck, and the \nsupinator arch or arcade of Froese. There is no cutaneous innervation by the posterior interosseous nerve. 693 \nSold by @itachibot",
