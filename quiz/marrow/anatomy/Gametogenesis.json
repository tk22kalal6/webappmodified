During the 2nd week of \ndevelopment, they originate in the epiblast at the caudal end of the primitive streak. They are the precursors of gametes in both genders. They pass through the primitive streak \nduring gastrulation and reach the wall of the yolk sac. They migrate from the yolk sac in the 4th \nweek and reach the developing gonads by the end of the 5th week.",

First level is the primary organizer that induces the development of new tissues. This newly \ndeveloped tissue can then induce another tissue in turn to become the secondary organizer. \nTherefore, there is a sequence or chain of organizers called primary, secondary, and tertiary \norganizers. Examples of the three levels of organizers: • Primary organizer: e.g., Blastopore induces differentiation of notochord • Secondary organizer: e.g., Notochord induces the development of the neural tube (that forms the \nbrain and spinal cord) • Tertiary organizer. e.g., Neural tube induces segmentation of paraxial mesoderm into somites",

      "explanation": "Independent assortment is the random distribution of chromosomes. It takes place during \nmeiosis I where there is division from primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte. The law of independent assortment states that alleles for separate traits are passed independently \nof one another into the gametes. During the first meiotic division, paternal and maternal chromosomes are distributed between the \ndaughter cells entirely at random. This prevents all chromosomes from the same source (mother \nor father) from ending up in the same gamete.
