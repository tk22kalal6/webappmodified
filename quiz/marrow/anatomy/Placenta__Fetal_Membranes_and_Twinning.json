      "explanation": "The structures labeled in the above image are (1) Decidua parietalis, (2) Decidua capsularis, (3) \nDecidua basalis, and (4) Uterine cavity. The decidua is the modified endometrium formed under the influence of progesterone and human \nchorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the cells of syncytiotrophoblast. After the implantation \nof the blastocyst, the decidua gets divided into 3 parts as follows: • Decidua capsularis: part surrounding the embryo and separating it from the uterine cavity • Decidua basalis: part deeper to the developing blastocyst that contributes to the maternal \ncomponent of the placenta • Decidua parietalis: part lining the rest of the uterine cavity The image given below shows the parts of decidua.",

The placenta is a fetomaternal organ containing tissues from two different sources as follows: • Maternal component - contributed by the decidua basalis. The decidua basalis is also referred to \nas the decidua serotina or decidual plate. • Fetal component - contributed by chorion frondosum. The chorionic villi adjacent to the decidua \nbasalis undergo significant development and branching to form a bushy region called chorion \nfrondosum.",

Maternal blood flows into the lacunar spaces of the syncytiotrophoblast as early as the 9th day of \npregnancy. After the formation of chorionic villi, the lacunar space is known as the intervillous \nspace. Eroded uterine spiral arteries empty into the intervillous space and immerse the chorionic villi in \nmaternal blood. In the fully formed placenta, the intervillous spaces contain about 150 mL of \nblood that is replaced every 15–20 seconds (i.e. three to four times per minute).",

They are seen in the fetal villi of the placenta from the first trimester of pregnancy \nuntil birth. The role of Hofbauer cells is not established yet, but they are thought to play a gate-keeper role in \npreventing the transmission of pathogens from the mother to the fetus.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows the fertilization of two different ova by two different sperms that will \nresult in dizygotic twins, each with its own chorion and amnion (bichorial, biamnionic). Dizygotic twins arise from two oocytes that mature during the same menstrual cycle and are \nfertilized by two different sperm cells. Thus, dizygotic twins can be of the same or opposite sex. 58 \nSold by @itachibot Dizygotic embryos implant separately and develop membranes that are independent of each \nother. Each twin has its own placenta, its own chorion, and its own amniotic cavity. Dizygotic twins are more common than monozygotic twins. They are also known as fraternal \ntwins, sibling twins, or false twins because genetically they are as different as two separately born \nsiblings of the same biological parents. The image given below shows how fertilization occurs in fraternal and identical twins.",

In monochorionic monoamniotic twinning, incomplete duplication of the embryonic disc can \noccur. Incomplete separation of the monozygotic twins results in the birth of two infants that are \njoined or fused together at some part of the body.

The following image shows \nthe lambda/twin peak. Dichorial, diamniotic twins can occur in 2 instances: • Dizygotic twins: The two fertilized ova get implanted at two separate sites and develop separate \nchorion and two separate amniotic cavities • Monozygotic twins: With early blastomere separation (up to 3rd day after fertilization), the two \nembryos formed will have separate chorionic and amniotic sacs, similar to dizygotic twins.",
