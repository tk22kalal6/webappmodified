      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Stratum spinosum of the epidermis is also referred to as the prickle cell layer. Stratum spinosum consists of inter-cellular attachments called desmosomes. During the H&amp;E \nmounting, the cells shrink and retract at places other than their attachment at the \ndesmosomes. Thus, these desmosomes appear like spines on the cells on microscopy, and hence \nthe cells are called as prickle cells. 294 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The stratum corneum (horny layer) consists of multiple layers of anucleate keratinocytes that \noften intertwine resulting in a basketweave appearance. The deepest layer, stratum basale, contains the stem cells which divide and start moving \nsuperficially. As cells move more superficially, they begin to lose their nuclei and become \nprogressively dehydrated, flattened and intertwined. Traces of flattened nuclei may be seen in \nsome cells of stratum lucidum. Stratum corneum, because of its thickness, prevents entry of microbes from the environment into \nthe body as well as preventing leakage of fluids from the body to the environment. This is called \nbarrier function. 295 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, the region marked X points towards the location of intercellular \nadhesions formed by desmosomes. Desmosomes (maculae adherens) are specialized adhesive protein complexes that localize to \nintercellular junctions. They are responsible for maintaining the mechanical integrity of tissues \nand resisting shearing forces. They are made of intercellular filaments, dense cytoplasmic plaques \nwithin the cells on either side and intermediate filaments. Hemidesmosomes are specialized structures for the cell to extracellular material adhesions. The schematic representation shows the desmosomal proteins and relative distance from the \nplasma membrane. The desmosomal cadherins, the desmogleins and desmocollins, extend into \nthe intercellular space and outer dense plaque to establish contact and adhere to neighbouring \ncells. The cadherin cytoplasmic tails associate linker proteins, plakoglobin, plakophilins, and \ndesmoplakin. The desmoplakin binds to keratin intermediate filaments within the inner dense \nplaque, serving to tether the intermediate filaments to the plasma membrane.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Melanocytes are present in the stratum basale of the epidermis. They are the neural crest derivatives that migrate to the stratum basale during the embryonic \nperiod. One melanocyte accumulates for every five or six basal keratinocytes. Melanocytes synthesise the pigment, melanin. This is then transferred along the dendritic \nprocesses of the melanocyte in vesicles called melanosomes. The tips of these processes are then \nphagocytosed by the surrounding keratinocytes, which then take up the melanin. The image below shows multiple melanocytes marked with arrows in the stratum basale of the \nepidermis. 297 \nSold by @itachibot",

Contraction of these muscles leads to the erection of hair, tiny bumps on the \nskin and thus produces a 'goose flesh’ appearance.
