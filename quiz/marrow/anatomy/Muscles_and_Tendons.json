It is the contracture of the flat or broad \nsheet-like tendon known as the aponeurosis, which leads to flexion deformities of the fingers, \nespecially the ring and little fingers. The aponeurosis is a pearly-white sheet of fibrous tissue that replaces tendons in sheet-like \nmuscles having wide areas of attachment. They are whitish-silvery in colour and shiny. It is \nsimilar to tendons in histology and are sparingly supplied with blood vessels and nerves. Examples of aponeuroses include: • Palmar aponeuroses on the palms of the hands • Plantar aponeuroses on the plantar aspect of the foot • Anterior abdominal aponeuroses superficial to the rectus abdominis muscles • Anterior and posterior intercostal membranes between the ribs • Scalp aponeuroses or galea aponeurotica in the scalp 1180 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: The retinaculum is a strong, short, and broad fibrous band around the tendons which \nholds them in place. Option B: The linear fibrous band formed by interdigitation of the tendinous or aponeurotic ends \nof the muscles is known as raphe.

Motor units can be classified as follows: • Small motor units (5–10 muscle fibers) are found in muscles of fine movements (such as \nextraocular muscles). • Large motor units (100–2000 muscle fibers) are found in muscles of gross movements (such \nas proximal limb muscles).",
