      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Arcuate nucleus is not associated with amnestic disorders. The neuroanatomical structures involved in the etiology of amnestic memory include: • Mammillary bodies • Hippocampus • Amygdala • Dorsomedial and the midline thalamic nuclei",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Route navigation is a function of declarative memory that is impaired in patients with amnesia. \nNon-declarative memory is preserved in amnesia. Declarative memory supports the conscious recollection of facts and events. • Memory for routes, lists, faces, melodies, objects • Memory for other verbal and nonverbal material Non-declarative memory includes: 133 \nSold by @itachibot • Skill learning • Habit learning • Simple forms of conditioning",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Severe retrograde amnesia with minimal or no anterograde amnesia is seen in post-traumatic \nstress disorder. It is referred to as dissociative/psychogenic amnesia. It is also known as hysterical \namnesia or functional amnesia. Psychogenic amnesia presents with a sudden onset of: • Extensive and severe retrograde amnesia • A loss of personal identity - unable to recall their own name, information from childhood, or \nfrom their past. • Minimal anterograde amnesia The other given options can all cause both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ribot's law deals with retrograde amnesia. During incidents of retrograde amnesia, most recently acquired memories are the most vulnerable \nto disruption from brain damage. This temporal gradation of retrograde amnesia that \npreferentially spares the more distant memories is known as Ribot's law. E.g: If an incident causing retrograde amnesia occurs at 30 years of age, the memories acquired at \n25 years of age may be more severely affected than those memories acquired at 20 years of age or \nearlier.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Cognitive decline from previous level in one or more cognitive domain",
        "b": "The deficit occurs exclusively during an episode of delirium",

        "d": "Mini mental state examination score of 26"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Mild neurocognitive disorder does not occur exclusively during an episode of delirium. Mild neurocognitive disorder or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a level of cognitive \nimpairment which is: • Not severe enough to be diagnosed as dementia • Not mild enough to be called a part of the normal aging process. General Criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment: • Not normal, but does not meet criteria for dementia syndrome either. • Cognitive decline: 134 \nSold by @itachibot • The patient and/or informant report an impairment in objective cognitive tasks. • Evidence of decline over time in objective cognitive tasks. • Preserved basic activities of daily living/minimal impairment in complex instrumental functions. • MMSE score between 25-27 (out of 30) Single domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment usually progresses to Alzheimer's disease.",

      "question": "Question 6: A 72-year-old man was taken to the psychiatrist by his son for memory issues. The elderly \nman had been living in his own house for the past 40 years, where he used to ritually water \nhis garden every day after breakfast. Recently he moved to his son’s flat in Delhi but forgets \nthis, and continues to get ready after breakfast to go and water his garden. Neuropsychiatric \nevaluation is normal except for some mild cognitive impairment. What is this phenomenon \ncalled?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario in which information stored earlier interferes with the retrieval of new \ninformation is called proactive interference. Option A: Retroactive Interference - new information interferes with the retrieval of information \nstored earlier. Option C: Output interference - the initial act of recalling particular information interferes with \nthe retrieval of the original information. For example, When trying to remember a limited number \nof items, such as a list of words or the names of individuals in a group, recalling some items can \nmake it more difficult to recall other items in the same collection. Option D: Biological Amnesia - amnesia due to brain damage.",

      "question": "Question 7: A 42-year-old man had a fall followed by one episode of vomiting. When brought to the \ncasualty, he was awake and conscious but had unrelieved anterograde amnesia. Which of the \nfollowing is the most likely cause?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history of fall and anterograde amnesia points towards the diagnosis of concussion. A concussion is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. It can result from vehicle \naccidents, falls, sports injuries, etc. Anterograde amnesia/post-traumatic amnesia is the hallmark \nof a concussion. In this type of amnesia, the events following the injury cannot be recalled. Other clinical features of concussion include headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Option A: Drunkenness - the patient will be drowsy or sleepy and not awake. Option B: Diffuse axonal injury - seen in high-speed deceleration which causes disruption and \nshearing of axons leading to microhemorrhages. Usually results in a persistent vegetative stage. Option D: Cerebral venous thrombosis - acute thrombosis in dural venous sinuses; manifests as \nheadache, visual abnormalities, or seizures. 135 \nSold by @itachibot Depressive Disorders",
