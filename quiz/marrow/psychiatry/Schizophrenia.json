      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The patient has auditory hallucination, reduced affect, lack of insight, impaired judgment for \nmore than 6 months, which makes the diagnosis of schizophrenia more likely. Schizophrenia was previously known as dementia praecox, a term first coined by Emil Kraepelin. \nHe classified psychiatric illness into two categories – dementia praecox and manic depressive \ndisorder. Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (DSM-5): 88 \nSold by @itachibot 1. The DSM-5 criteria to diagnose schizophrenia require a total duration of 6 months. 2. Within this 6-month period, there must be at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms (overt \npsychotic symptoms) where 2 or more of the following have to be present (at least one must be \namong the a, b, or c): • Delusion • Hallucination • Disorganized speech (or formal thought disorder) • Disorganized behavior • Affective flattening or other negative symptoms 3. The rest of the 6-month period may include • Continuing psychotic symptoms • Prodromal symptoms preceding clear-cut psychosis • Residual symptoms after the resolution of the psychotic symptoms 4. Residual symptoms are defined as attenuated forms of psychotic symptoms, such as: • Odd beliefs • Magical thinking • Ideas of reference • Odd perceptual experiences • Peculiar or concrete thinking • Vague speech • Odd behavior • Negative symptoms may also be included 5. Exclusion of mood disorder &amp; substance abuse Note: DSM-5 does not require that delusions must be bizarre.",

      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Dopaminergic hyperactivity in the subcortical regions is seen in schizophrenia. All of the following neurotransmitters have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia: • Dopamine - dopaminergic hyperactivity in the subcortical region and hypoactivity in prefrontal \ncortical regions is seen. It is linked to positive symptoms and cognitive deficits respectively. • Serotonin excess is linked to both positive and negative symptoms. • Norepinephrine - selective neuronal degeneration within the norepinephrine reward neural \nsystem is thought to be responsible for anhedonia, a feature of schizophrenia. 89 \nSold by @itachibot • GABA has a regulatory effect on dopamine activity. In some patients, there is a loss of inhibitory \nGABAergic neurons, which could indirectly lead to the hyperactivity of dopaminergic \nneurons. Increased GABAA receptor binding has been reported in the prefrontal and cingulate \ncortices and the hippocampus. • Acetylcholine and nicotine- decreased levels of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the \nhippocampus is seen. • NMDA- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypoactivity is seen in the prefrontal cortex.",

      "explanation": "This scenario describes an abnormal family dynamic, where one parent is overly close to the child \nof the opposite gender. This is known as marital schism. Marital schism, marital skew, expressed emotions, and double-bind refer to abnormalities of \nfamily dynamics. They act as psychosocial stressors, hampering the adaptive capacity of the \nindividual, thus contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Marital schism- one parent is overly close to the child of the opposite gender. Marital skew- a disharmonious situation where one parent dominates over the other. Expressed emotions- parents or other caregivers may behave with overt criticism, hostility, or \nover-involvement towards a person with schizophrenia, which further worsens the illness. Double bind- a hypothetical family in which children receive conflicting parental messages about \ntheir behavior, attitudes, and feelings. 90 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Ambivalence is not a Schneiderian first-rank symptom of schizophrenia. It is one of the 4A’s of \nschizophrenia as described by Bleuler. The first rank symptoms of schizophrenia described by Kurt Schneider include : 1. Hallucination: • First-person hallucination (audible thoughts) - auditory hallucinations of the person’s own voice \nbeing spoken aloud. • Second-person hallucination (voices directly addressing the patient) - auditory hallucinations of 1 \nor more voices talking directly to the person. They can be persecutory, complimentary, or issue \ncommands (command hallucination) • Third-person hallucination (voices speaking about the patient) - auditory hallucinations of 1 or \nmore voices speaking about the person. The voice may deliver a running commentary or the \nvoices maybe be arguing/discussing the person. 2. Thought phenomenon: • Thought withdrawal- thoughts being actively removed from a person’s mind. • Thought insertion- thoughts inserted into a person’s mind by some external agent. • Thought broadcasting- the sense that a person’s thoughts are experienced by others - the \nthoughts are made audible or may be experienced by others through telepathy. 3. Made phenomenon: • Made affect- feelings are imposed on that person by an external agent. • Made impulses or drives - an impulse for action is imposed on a person by some external agent. • Made volitional acts - a person’s actions are controlled by an external agent; the person is a \npassive participant in the action. 91 \nSold by @itachibot 4. Delusional perception- the person attaches an abnormal significance/meaning to a normal \nperception, which leads to delusional interpretation. The most common delusion in schizophrenia \nis the delusion of persecution. These persecutory fears of the patient can range from transient \ndoubts to profound convictions that people are plotting to have them tortured or killed. 5. Somatic passivity- tactile or visceral hallucinations that are thought to be imposed on a person's \nbody by some external agent. These symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia and may also be present in other psychiatric \ndisorders.",

DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective disorder: 92 \nSold by @itachibot • An uninterrupted period of illness where there is a mood episode (depression or \nmania) concurrent with psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, etc.) • Delusions or hallucinations (psychotic symptoms) for at least two weeks in the absence of a \nmajor depressive or manic episode during the lifetime course of the illness. • Mood symptoms present for the majority of total illnesses. • Not due to intake of substances or another medical condition. Differential diagnosis: • Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features: Psychotic symptoms occur \nexclusively during mood episodes. • Schizophrenia: Mood symptoms are absent or present for only brief periods during the course of \nthe illness dominated by psychotic symptoms. Note: According to DSM-5 guidelines, for a definitive diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, there \nhave to be two psychotic episodes. One of the psychotic episodes has to be concurrent with a \nsevere affective (depression or manic) episode.

Oculogyric crisis refers to the spasm of the extraocular muscles, usually causing upward and \noutward deviation of the eyes. It is a severe form of acute dystonia, an extrapyramidal side effect \nof antipsychotics like risperidone. It can be treated by drugs with antimuscarinic activities like \npromethazine. Dystonia is acute in onset and occurs within 1-5 days of starting treatment. It is more common in \nthe younger population. The proposed mechanism of action is D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal \npathway. There is typical involvement of head and neck muscles and presents in a variety of \nforms, such as torticollis, trismus, mouth opening dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric \ncrisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with D2 blocking but strong 5HT2 antagonistic \nactivity. Its main side effects include weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia, \ndyslipidemia, fatigue, etc. At low doses, extrapyramidal side effects are less, but can be significant 96 \nSold by @itachibot in higher doses. Extrapyramidal side effects include; • Parkinsonism: Features are bradykinesia, rigidity, variable tremor, masked facies, and shuffling \ngait. • Acute dystonia: Which causes spasms of muscles of the tongue, face, eyes, neck, back, etc. • Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Extreme rigidity, fever, unstable blood \npressure,myoglobinemia, etc. • Rabbit syndrome: Perioral tremors occur as a delayed variant of parkinsonism. Other options: Option A: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. Its adverse effects include sedation, light-headedness, \nconfusional state, weight gain, etc. Option C: Olanzapine is also an atypical antipsychotic.
