      "question": "Question 1: A worried mother brought her son to the OPD due to poor performance in sports as he \nstruggles to perform activities such as jumping, running, or catching a ball. He also exhibits \ndifficulty in assembling jigsaw pieces, using scissors or drawing. What is the most likely \ndiagnosis in this child?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Based on the clinical features mentioned above, the diagnosis is developmental coordination \ndisorder. Developmental coordination disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which a child's fine \nand/or gross motor coordination is slower, less accurate, and more variable than in peers of the \nsame age, which cannot be correlated with any specific neurological disorder or damage. 339 \nSold by @itachibot Diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is based on the following: • A history of the child's delay in achieving early motor milestones. • Association with below-normal scores on performance subtests of standardized intelligence tests \nand normal or above-normal scores on verbal subtests. These children struggle to perform accurately the gross motor activities of daily life, such as \njumping, hopping, running, or catching a ball. They also exhibit difficulty in fine motor skills like \nassembling jigsaw pieces, using scissors, drawing, or tracing. This results in poor performance in \nsports and even in academic achievement because of poor writing skills. Yet, they excel at verbal \nskills. Three general areas of deficits contribute to the disorder: • Poor predictive control of motor movements • Deficits in rhythmic coordination and timing • Deficits in executive functions, including working memory, inhibition, and attention.",

      "options": {
        "a": "The movements are typically non-rhythmic.",
        "b": "The movements often appear to be self-soothing.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Stereotypic movements often appear to be self-soothing or self-stimulating; however, they can \nresult in self-injury in some cases. According to DSM-5, stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by repetitive, seemingly \ndriven, apparently purposeless motor behaviour, that interferes with social, academic, or other \nactivities and may result in self-harm. These movements are typically rhythmic, such as hand-flapping, body-rocking, hand-waving, \nhair-twirling, lip-licking, skin-picking, or self-hitting.",

      "question": "Question 3: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the OPD with complaints of repeated shoulder-shrugging \nmovements.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of persistent motor tic disorder which is characterized by \nmotor tics persisting for more than 1 year. Persistent/chronic motor tic disorder: • Presence of motor tics in the absence of vocal tics for more than 1 year • Tics may wax and wane over the course of illness • School-age boys are at the highest risk • Generally follows a benign course with symptoms remitting by adolescence Option A: Juvenile myoclonus is not characterized by an urge to move and it generally follows a \nprogressive course. Option B: Tourette's syndrome will have both motor and vocal tics. Option C: Normal social milestones rule out autism. 340 \nSold by @itachibot",

Clozapine, contrary to many other atypical \nantipsychotics, has not been found to be useful in the treatment of tics (including Tourette's \nsyndrome). Treatment modalities used for Tourette's syndrome (in order of preference): • Detection and treatment of co-morbidities like OCD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety. • Education and behavioral treatments - habit reversal, exposure, and response prevention are \nthe behavioral treatments of choice. • Adrenergic alpha-2 agonists (always to be tried first before starting antipsychotics) - \nclonidine and guanfacine are found to be effective. • Antipsychotics - aripiprazole and risperidone are effective and preferred over typical \nantipsychotics. Pimozide and haloperidol may be more efficient but are often poorly tolerated and \nneed constant monitoring. Note: Botulinum toxin has been used to treat painful focal motor tics affecting the neck muscles.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome. Habit reversal training is \nused in the treatment of tic disorders like Tourette's. The components of habit reversal training are: • Awareness training in which the patient is taught self-monitoring to enhance awareness of tic \nbehaviours and urges or sensations indicating that a tic is about to occur. • Competing-response training in which the patient is taught to voluntarily perform a behaviour \nthat is physically incompatible with the tic. Options A and C: Systemic desensitization and flooding are used in the treatment of phobias. Option D: Aversion therapy is used in the treatment of alcohol abuse, impulsive behaviours, etc. 342 \nSold by @itachibot Special Areas of Childhood Mental Health",
