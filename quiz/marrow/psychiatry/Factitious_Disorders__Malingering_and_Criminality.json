      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen \nsyndrome. • The patient is referred to as a professional patient wherein the person always fakes the \ndisease/symptoms, and keep going from doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital in order to seek \nmedical attention. • Such patients will have extensive medical history or evidence of multiple surgeries and have a \ncharacteristic gridiron abdomen i.e., multiple scars on the abdomen. • They distort their history and findings and make it hard to come to a diagnosis when there isn’t \nany existing pathology. • The Symptoms do not respond to usual treatment or medications and there will be emergence of \nnew, unusual symptoms when other symptoms resolve. • They will give history of multiple allergies. • Such patients will only have few visitors while in the hospital. • They will be reluctant to give access to collateral sources of information ( for example, contact \ndetails of family) • They will have unusual progression of symptoms or unusual response to treatment. 244 \nSold by @itachibot Delusional disorders - It is when a person exhibits nonbizarre delusions (about situations that can \noccur in real life, such as being followed or infected) for least 1 month, that cannot be attributed to \nother psychiatric disorders.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Patients with Munchausen syndrome (factitious disorder) demonstrate pseudologia fantastica, a \nspecific syndrome of autobiographical lying with four features: • The stories are not entirely improbable and are built upon a basis of truth. • The stories are enduring. • They are not told purely for personal gain and have a self-aggrandizing quality. • They are not delusions, in that the patient can admit to falsehoods when confronted with \nconflicting facts. In pseudologia fantastica, limited factual material is mixed with extensive and colourful fantasies. \nThe listener's interest pleases the patient and, thus, reinforces the symptom.",

      "explanation": "Persons with factitious disorder usually do not have the eccentricities of dress, thought, or \ncommunication that characterizes schizotypal personality disorder patients. Personality disorders simulating factitious disorder: • Antisocial personality disorder: • Similarities - pathological lying, lack of close relationships with others, hostile and manipulative \nmanner, and associated substance abuse and criminal history. • Differences - antisocial persons, however, do not usually volunteer for invasive procedures or \nresort to repeated or long-term hospitalization. • Histrionic personality disorder: • Similarities - attention-seeking and an occasional flair for the dramatic • Differences - but not all factitious disorder patients have a dramatic flair; many are withdrawn \nand bland. • Borderline personality disorder: • Similarities - chaotic lifestyle, history of disturbed interpersonal relationships, identity crisis, \nsubstance abuse, self-damaging acts, and manipulative tactics. • Differences - factitious disorder patients are keen on hospital admission because of such \nactivities. 245 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 4: 242 \nSold by @itachibot A 2-year-old boy was admitted for evaluation of fever. However, there were inconsistencies in \nthe mother's reporting of medical information. Further exploration revealed that she had \ntaken her child to multiple hospitals giving varying histories of lupus, asthma, etc that \nprompted excessive testing.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In this scenario, the inaccurate histories given by the mother to prompt excessive testing on the \nchild, point towards a diagnosis of factitious disorder by proxy (DSM-5 diagnosis of \"Factitious \nDisorder Imposed on Another\"). The most common case of factitious disorder by proxy involves a mother who deceives medical \npersonnel into believing that her child is ill. Here, the affected person intentionally produces \nphysical signs or symptoms in another person who is under his own care. One apparent purpose \nof the behavior is for the caretaker to indirectly assume the sick role.",

      "question": "Question 6: An 18-year-old boy is brought to you by his concerned grandmother with a history of having \nexperienced several episodes of jerking of the body the day before his final exam.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, absence of muscle spasm, tongue thrusting, or post-ictal confusion, and \nnormal investigations just before the final exam (personal gain), points towards malingering. Intentional production of symptoms to achieve some practical gain (e.g. avoidance of work, \nfinancial compensation, avoidance of criminal responsibility, or military service) is suggestive of \nmalingering. Factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome) is the intentional production of physical symptoms to \nobtain medical attention, not a practical gain.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Malingering can have many underlying goals, including financial/personal gain. However, \nfactitious disorder has only one motive - seeking and attaining medical attention. Malingering is suspected when there is: • Medicolegal context of presentation • Discrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or disability and the objective findings • Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the prescribed \ntreatment regimen • Presence of antisocial personality disorder Malingering can be for the following reasons: • Avoidance of criminal responsibility 246 \nSold by @itachibot • Avoidance of military service or of particularly hazardous duties • Financial gain • Avoidance of work, social responsibility, and social consequences. • Facilitation of transfer from prison to hospital • Admission to a hospital (for getting a place to stay) The discrepancy between symptoms and examination findings, and conscious production of \nsymptoms can be present in both disorders. In Malingering, patients can usually stop producing \ntheir signs and symptoms when they are no longer considered profitable or when they become \nrisky. 247 \nSold by @itachibot Dissociative Disorders",
