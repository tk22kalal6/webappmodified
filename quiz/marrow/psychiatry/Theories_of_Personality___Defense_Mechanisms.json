      "explanation": "Sigmund Freud is credited with all the above-mentioned achievements except psychosocial \ntheory (proposed by Erik Erikson). Contributions of Sigmund Freud to the field of psychiatry: • Free association • Interpretation of dreams • Psychoanalysis • Psycho-sexual development • Psychodynamic theory • Topographic theory of the mind - unconscious, preconscious, conscious 12 \nSold by @itachibot • Structural theory of mind - id, ego, super-ego • Cocaine in psychiatry Option A: Concept of free association is a technique in psychoanalysis where the patient is asked \nto freely share thoughts, random words, and anything else that comes to mind. Option B: Cocaine was introduced in psychiatry as a remedy for morphine and alcohol abuse. Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction \nbetween the conscious and unconscious forces of id, ego, and super-ego.",

        "a": "Id- principle of reality, in the conscious domain",
        "b": "Ego- principle of pleasure, in the unconscious domain",

        "d": "Id- defence mechanisms, in the unconscious domain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The superego is based on the principle of idealism, both in the conscious and unconscious \ndomain. It acts to perfect and civilize our behaviour. The voice of conscience comes from the \nsuperego. It is mostly unconscious but also has a conscious component. Sigmund Freud's structural theory of mind divides mental apparatus into the following: • Id (new-born) is a reservoir for basic survival instincts, aggression, and survival drives. It is \nbased on the pleasure principle (immediate gratification). It is entirely unconscious. • Ego (reality principle) is the executive part of the mind that maintains the balance between id \nand superego. It is based on exposure to reality and utilizes influences from the external world to \nmodify the id. It is conscious except for unconscious defense mechanisms. • Superego (idealism principle) establishes and maintains a moral conscience in an individual by \nconstantly comparing a person’s thoughts and feelings to expected standards of behavior. E.g., While studying, our id wants us to watch a movie instead and our superego wants us to study \nvery hard without taking many breaks. Our ego thus balances between the two and we decide that \nwe will study for few hours and then take a break to watch a movie.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "According to Sigmund Freud, the preconscious part of our mind has a barrier called \nrepression. This barrier separates the contents of the unconscious and the conscious mind. Sigmund Freud's topographic theory of mind divides the mind into 3 levels: • Unconscious- contains instinctual drives, repressed memories, and thought processes. It is \ncharacterized by illogical and primitive thoughts called primary process thinking. It focuses on \nimmediate wish fulfillment and instinctual discharge. • Preconscious- composed of mental events, processes, and contents that can be brought into \nconscious awareness by the act of focusing attention. It contains a barrier called repression. Eg: \nAlthough most persons are not consciously aware of the appearance of their first-grade teacher, \nthey ordinarily can bring this image to mind by deliberately focusing attention on the memory. • Conscious- part of the mind which is accessible to us. Everything we know about ourselves is in \nthe conscious part of our mind. Perceptions coming from the outside world or from within the 13 \nSold by @itachibot body or mind are brought into awareness in this part. Note: The unconscious is the part of the mind that contains repressed thoughts and memories \nwhereas the barrier that censors these (repression) exists in the preconscious part of the mind.",

        "d": "The contents of the preconscious mind can be brought into awareness by focussing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "According to Sigmund Freud's topographical theory, an unconscious memory or thought can \nreach consciousness by overcoming the barrier of repression. This barrier can be overcome in two ways: • During sleep- the repression force is lax, and thus many unconscious desires and thoughts reach \nour consciousness through dreams. So, he believed that the interpretation of dreams can reveal \nthe contents of the unconscious mind. • Free association- when a person is relaxed enough to say whatever comes to their minds without \ncensoring thoughts, a few unconscious thoughts may come out by a slip of the tongue. Note: In psychotherapy, there is a process called abreaction by which repressed material, \nparticularly a painful experience or conflict, is brought back to consciousness by hypnosis or free \nassociation. In this process, the person not only recalls but also relives the repressed material \ncausing an emotional release.",

It is a \nspecific type of catharsis done by becoming conscious of repressed traumatic events. Catharsis is a general term for the process of releasing strong or repressed emotions. It can be \ndone through various mediums, like expressing emotions through art. When the unconscious \nrepressed memories are consciously recalled and relived, this technique specifically is called \nabreaction.",

According to the 'Interpretation of dreams' written by Sigmund Freud, dreams represent \nunconscious wishes or thoughts which are not accepted by the conscious mind. They manifest \nthrough the following mechanisms: Symbolism: Representation of highly charged ideas or objects through innocent images that are in \nsome way connected. 14 \nSold by @itachibot Displacement: Transfer of mental energy from one object to a substitute or symbolic \nrepresentation of the object. Condensation: Mechanism by which multiple unconscious wishes combine into a single image or \nwhen one unconscious wish gets distributed into multiple images.

The phallic phase has 2 complexes: • Oedipus complex in a male child • Electra complex in a female child. 15 \nSold by @itachibot The Oedipus complex consists of a desire for sexual involvement with the mother and a sense of \nrivalry with the father. The male child is also scared that if the father finds out, he will castrate \nhim, this is called castration anxiety. The opposite is true for the Electra complex which is the desire for sexual involvement with the \nfather and a sense of rivalry with the mother. The girl child becomes aware of the fact that she \ndoes not have a penis, this is called penis envy and she holds her mother responsible for it.

The stages are: • Sensorimotor stage (birth–2 years): • Starts with an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type of thinking • Ends with object permanence (knowing an object exists even though it cannot be seen) • Symbolisation- developing mental symbols and words for the objects • Pre-operational stage (2-7 years): • Thinking without reasoning- intuitive thinking • Only concerned about their own needs and perspective- egocentric thinking • Other thinking processes are seen- animism, primitive thinking, centration, magical or fantasy \nthinking • Concrete operational stage (7-11 years): • Start to see things from other's perspectives • Thinking is concrete and literal • Develop conservation- understanding that despite changes in shape, the object remains the \nsame. For eg: when water is transferred from a cup to glass, they understand that it is water only \nand that the volume is the same • Develop the concept of reversibility- knowing that one thing can turn into another and turn \nback. Eg., water and ice • Other processes- classification, transitivity • Formal operational stage (&gt;11 years): • Develop abstract thinking, wherein they can generalize or conceptualize • Can make a hypothesis and use deductive reasoning • Hypotheticodeductive thinking- the highest organization of cognition, enables persons to make a \nhypothesis or proposition and to test it against reality",
