A person may believe that they can never escape the \nabuser, even when help and support are available. Option B: The theory of psychosocial development was proposed by Erik Erikson. There are 8 \nstages of psychosocial development. He states that there are critical time periods, each of which \nposes a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual. The resolution of this conflict results in \neither psychosocial growth or regression. Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction \nbetween the conscious and unconscious forces of Id, ego, and super-ego. Option D: Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior which \nproposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.",

DSM-V criteria for diagnosis of depression: • Depressed mood most of the day • Anhedonia- diminished interest in day-to-day activities • Significant weight loss or weight gain and/or change in appetite. • Insomnia or hypersomnia • Psychomotor agitation or retardation • Fatigue or loss of energy • Feelings of worthlessness or excessive, inappropriate guilt • Diminished ability to think or concentrate, indecisiveness 156 \nSold by @itachibot • Recurrent thoughts of death and suicide At least five out of nine symptoms must be present over a two-week period \nand one symptom must be depressed mood or anhedonia. Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (option B) is not the diagnosis as there is the \npresence of a psychosocial stressor (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). It is \nexplicitly mentioned in the question that the patient always remains unemployed during the \nwinter months which acts as the objective psychological stressor in this case. Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern refers to the onset and remission of major \ndepressive episodes at specific times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in the fall or \nwinter and remit in spring. Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often \ncharacterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for \ncarbohydrates. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least \na 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes during this period. Dysthymia (option C) is the presence of a persistently depressed mood that lasts most of the day \nand is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These \nsymptoms are present for at least 2 years. Dysthymia will also never present with an episode of \nmania/hypomania. Cyclothymia (option D) is a mild form of bipolar II disorder, characterized by symptoms \nof hypomania and mild depression. Hypomania mainly includes symptoms like persistently \nelevated or irritable mood and abnormally increased energy lasting for at least 4 consecutive \ndays. The depression seen in cyclothymia does not qualify the criteria for a major depressive \nepisode.",
