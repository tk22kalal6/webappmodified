      "explanation": "175 \nSold by @itachibot The use of illegal drugs or drug-related legal problems is not an exclusive criterion to diagnose \nsubstance use disorder under DSM-5. Substance use disorder can occur with legally available substances like alcohol, tobacco and some \nprescription drugs. Substance use disorder is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically \nsignificant impairment. It is manifested by 2 or more out of 11 criteria occurring within a \n12-month period. DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing substance use disorder: • Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill obligations at work, school, or home. e.g., \nsubstance-related absences or expulsions from school. • Recurrent substance use even in physically hazardous situations e.g., driving an automobile \nwhen impaired by substance use. • Continued substance use despite having persistent social problems caused by the effects of the \nsubstance e.g., arguments with the spouse. • Continued substance use despite having a physical or psychological problem that is likely to have \nbeen caused by the substance. • The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. • Efforts are made to cut down or control substance use but are unsuccessful. • Tolerance - there is markedly diminished desired effect with continued use of the same amount \nof the substance, hence there is a need for increased amounts of the substance to achieve \nintoxication. • Withdrawal - developing characteristic withdrawal symptoms for the substance, which can be \nrelieved by taking the same or closely related substance. • Craving or a strong desire or urge to use a specific substance. • A great deal of time is spent to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its \neffects. • Important activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.",

It contains \nsix items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and \ndependence. Option B: Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-Q) was developed to assess the \nseverity of alcohol dependence. Option C: The CAGE questionnaire is used to assess whether or not there is a problem with \ndependence. • C - Have you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking? • A - Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? • G - Have you ever felt guilty or bad about your drinking? • E - Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a \nhangover (eye-opener)? One 'yes' response raises a suspicion of an alcohol use problem and more than one is a strong \nindication of abuse or dependence. Option D: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening tool \ndeveloped by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess alcohol consumption, drinking \nbehaviors, and alcohol-related problems.

      "explanation": "The given situation can be best explained by the Mellanby effect. 177 \nSold by @itachibot The Mellanby effect is the phenomenon where an individual’s perceived level of impairment at \nidentical blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels is greater when the BAC is rising (while \ndrinking) than when it is falling (after drinking). The clip below describes the Mellanby effect seen originally in a dog experiment. Option B: Intermediate syndrome is a delayed-onset of muscular weakness and paralysis following \nan episode of organophosphate (acute cholinesterase inhibitor) poisoning. Option C: Reverse tolerance refers to the phenomenon when an individual requires a lesser dose \nof alcohol (drug) to obtain the same effect as before. Option D: Grand Rapids effect or dip is a controversial effect noted in certain studies where a BAC \nof 0.01–0.04% slightly lowered the risk of being in a vehicle accident when compared to a BAC of \n0.00%",

      "explanation": "When an individual requires a lesser dose of alcohol (drug) to obtain the same effect as before, \nthis phenomenon is known as reverse tolerance. In alcoholics, it is a sign of late-stage alcoholism, where the patient has developed cirrhosis. The \nliver doesn’t produce enough enzymes like before to metabolize alcohol leading to increased blood \nalcohol levels. Option A: Tachyphylaxis is the rapid development of tolerance when a drug is repeatedly used in \nquick succession, resulting in a marked reduction in response. Option B: Desensitization may be equivalent to drug tolerance and refers to a diminished \nresponse/effect with continued use of the same dose of the substance. Option D: Cross-tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs when tolerance to the effects of one drug \nproduces tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similar \npharmacological actions. eg. alcohol and benzodiazepines (both are depressants). 178 \nSold by @itachibot Note: A quarter bottle is approximately 180 ml.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Disulfiram is a deterrent agent, not an anti-craving drug. It is an irreversible aldehyde \ndehydrogenase inhibitor. Acetaldehyde is the first breakdown product of alcohol, which is further metabolized by aldehyde \ndehydrogenase. If a patient who is on disulfiram consumes alcohol, it results in toxic levels of \nacetaldehyde. This causes symptoms such as flushing, pulsating headache, nausea, vomiting, respiratory \ndifficulties, chest pain, and autonomic manifestations, collectively termed as disulfiram ethanol \nreaction (DER). Other deterrent agents include citrated calcium carbamide and metronidazole. Anti-craving drugs used in alcohol deaddiction include: • Baclofen • Acamprosate • Naltrexone • Newer drugs are topiramate, SSRI and ondansetron Alcohol deaddiction treatment involves the following phases: 1. Intervention - aimed at maximizing the motivation for treatment and continued abstinence. 2. Detoxification - involves minimizing withdrawal symptoms. 3. Rehabilitation and maintenance - includes three major components: • Continued efforts to increase and maintain high levels of motivation for abstinence • Work to help the patient readjust to a lifestyle free of alcohol • Relapse prevention",

Patients withdrawing from alcohol who \nexhibit withdrawal phenomena should receive benzodiazepines, such as 25 to 50 mg of \nchlordiazepoxide every 2 to 4 hours until they seem to be out of danger. Once the delirium appears, 50 to 100 mg of chlordiazepoxide should be given every 4 hours orally, \nor lorazepam should be given intravenously (IV) if oral medication is not possible.

MBD is a rare, idiopathic CNS disorder seen as a complication of chronic alcoholism. Early \nsymptoms may include depression, paranoia, psychosis, or dementia. Seizures, \nhemiparesis, aphasia, and abnormal movements, and ataxia are also seen. If not promptly \nidentified and treated may progress to coma and death. It is associated with central degeneration of corpus callosum, sparing the dorsal and ventral parts. \nThis characteristic pattern of degeneration presents as the 'sandwich' sign, best visualized on \nsagittal MRI of the brain. Clinically, conditions such as Wernicke’s encephalopathy, delirium tremens, or pontine \ndemyelination may have similar presentations and their features may overlap.
