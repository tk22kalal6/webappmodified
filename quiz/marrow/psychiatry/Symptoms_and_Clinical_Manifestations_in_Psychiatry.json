      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The patient is experiencing reflex hallucinations. In this scenario, a sensory stimulus in one \nmodality (auditory) is resulting in a sensory experience in a different modality (vibratory). Option A: Functional hallucinations are triggered by a stimulus in the same modality, and \nco-occur with it. E.g., a patient may report that he hears voices criticizing him (auditory \nhallucination) every time he hears the sound of a rotating fan (auditory stimulus), which stops \nwhen the fan is not running. Option C: Panoramic hallucination is a compound hallucination in which the entire sensory input \nis replaced by hallucinatory perceptions, thus giving rise to a totally different perceptual reality. Option D: Pseudohallucination is a false perception heard within one's own mind (inner subjective \nspace) rather than perceived as coming from the outside world (outer objective space), and is \nrecognized as unreal. Other special types of hallucinations: • Hypnogogic hallucination- occurs prior to falling asleep (HypnoGogic: Going to sleep). 29 \nSold by @itachibot • Hypnopompic hallucination- occurs prior to waking up. • Extracampine hallucination- experienced outside the limits of one's sensory field.

Abstract thinking is tested by asking the patient the meaning of a proverb or the similarities \nbetween objects like a table and a chair, or between a dog and a lion.

Features of Catatonia: • Mutism- complete absence of speech. • Rigidity- maintenance of a rigid posture against efforts. • Negativism- an apparently motiveless resistance to all commands. • Posturing- voluntary assumption of an inappropriate and often bizarre posture for long periods \nof time, against gravity. • Waxy flexibility- the patient's limbs can be manipulated to move in any position (flexible like \nwax), which is then retained by the patient for long periods of time, even if uncomfortable. • Stupor- akinesis (no movement) with mutism with relative preservation of conscious awareness. 33 \nSold by @itachibot • Echolalia- repetition of phrases or words heard. • Echopraxia- repetition of actions observed. • Ambitendency- tendency to act in opposing ways or directions because of conflicting impulses. \ne.g. on asking to take out the tongue, the tongue is slightly protruded but taken back again. • Gegenhalten- when subjects involuntary resist passive movements. The resistance is directly \nproportional to the force applied. Also called oppositional paratonia. • Mannerism- repetition of normal movements but inappropriately. They are purposeful. E.g., \nrepeatedly saluting the people around. • Stereotypy- repetitive, odd, purposeless movements. E.g., making strange movements of fingers \nrepeatedly. • Automatic obedience- commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature. 34 \nSold by @itachibot Assessment in Psychiatry",
