      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of an acute decline in the level of awareness and visual hallucinations \n(seeing bugs crawling on hand) in an elderly female admitted with fever and dysuria suggests a \ndiagnosis of delirium. Delirium is characterized by: • Acute decline in the level of awareness • Global impairment of cognitive functions (particularly attention) It also involves: • Perceptual disturbances like illusions and hallucinations • Abnormal psychomotor activity • Sleep cycle impairment Formication is a tactile (not visual) hallucination in which the patient experiences a feeling of \ninsects crawling under the skin.",

      "explanation": "Fluctuating course is suggestive of delirium. Characteristic presentation of delirium: • Acute onset • Brief duration - usually days to weeks • Decline in the level of consciousness. • Fluctuating course - unpredictable fluctuations in severity and other clinical manifestations • Sundowning - worsening of symptoms at night • Rapid improvement - when the underlying cause is treated • Other characteristics include asterixis, carphologia (picking movements on cover sheets and \nclothes) • More commonly associated with visual hallucinations",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of ICU psychosis (delirium). The following features are consistent with the diagnosis of delirium: • Acute onset of symptoms • Disorientation to place (jail instead of the hospital) • Disorientation to person (failure to recognize relatives and the doctor) • Altered sensorium Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behaviour \nthat lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses.

      "explanation": "Hypoactive delirium is commonly associated with hepatic and renal encephalopathies. The hypoactive clinical subtype of delirium can often be confused with depression due to \noverlapping symptoms of psychomotor retardation and affect. In delirium, however, the onset of such symptoms is more acute and is usually associated with \nsome medical illness.",

      "explanation": "Confusion assessment method (CAM) is a bedside screening test used in the diagnosis of delirium. It has two parts: • Part one - screens for overall cognitive impairment. • Part two - a diagnostic algorithm that screens for 4 cardinal features to distinguish delirium from \nother types of cognitive impairment. It can be assessed in less than 5 minutes. Diagnosis of delirium requires the presence of features 1 and 2 along with either feature 3 or 4. \ni.e., features 1 + 2 + (3 or 4) 113 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: CAGE questionnaire is used for addiction and substance abuse cases Option B: CHAT checklist is used in autism (CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers) Option D: GAD-7 scale is used in the assessment of generalized anxiety disorder CAM Diagnostic Algorit \nhm Feature 1 \nAcute onset and fluctuating c \nourse Feature 2 \nInattention Feature 3 \nDisorganized thinking Feature 4 \nAltered level of consciousnes \ns",

EEG findings in specific causes of delirium: • Focal impairment - localized cerebral event • Low voltage but fast-wave activity - drug/alcohol withdrawal Option A: Chaotic (hypsarrhythmia) – Infantile spasm, West syndrome Option B: 3Hz spike and wave – Absence seizures Option D: Isoelectric EEG – Deep coma / cerebral death",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Haloperidol is commonly used for the first-line pharmacological treatment of delirium. The two major symptoms of delirium that may require pharmacological treatment are psychosis \nand insomnia. Options A, B: Benzodiazepines are often used as an adjunct in agitated patients, but should be \nused judiciously for insomnia as their sedative property can worsen confusion in delirium. Option C: The use of second-generation antipsychotics may be considered for delirium \nmanagement, but clinical trial experience with these agents for delirium is limited. Clozapine itself \nis known to sometimes trigger delirium. Note: IV regimens of haloperidol are mostly used in the ICU in the critically ill due to their fast \nonset of action and predictable pharmacokinetics. Oral haloperidol may be used as a maintenance \nregimen in patients with a functional GI tract. Intramuscular haloperidol is considered only in \nacutely combative patients without IV access. 114 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The next step in management should be a reduction in the dose of levodopa. The patient presents with disorientation, confusion and altered sensorium. This is suggestive of \ndelirium. Anti-parkinsonian agents are frequently implicated in causing delirium because of \ndopamine increase. Decreasing the dosage of the antiparkinsonian agent has to be weighed against worsening of \nmotor symptoms. Clozapine is recommended when: • The antiparkinsonian agents cannot be further reduced • Delirium persists even after reducing the dose of antiparkinsonian agents If a patient is not able to tolerate clozapine, alternative antipsychotic agents should be considered. 115 \nSold by @itachibot Dementia",
