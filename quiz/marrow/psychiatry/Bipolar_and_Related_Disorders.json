      "explanation": "Lithium carbonate is most likely to cause the tremors described in the given scenario. Tremors are a common adverse effect of lithium carbonate. They are sometimes related to peak \nserum lithium levels. Dividing the dose of lithium carbonate and decreasing caffeine intake can decrease the severity of \nthe tremors. In case of severe coarse tremors, lithium carbonate toxicity (serum lithium level \ngreater than 2.5 mEq/L) must be ruled out. Options A and C: Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are off-label agents used for the management of \nbipolar disorder, however, they do not cause tremors. Option B: Tremors may occur as an adverse effect of gabapentin, but it is not prescribed for the \nmanagement of bipolar disorder.",

This is a rare congenital cyanotic heart \ndisease caused by the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is a \nteratogenic effect of lithium, a drug used for prophylaxis in manic disorder. Lithium is thus avoided in the first trimester and during lactation. An antipsychotic like \nolanzapine should be considered instead of prophylactic management.
