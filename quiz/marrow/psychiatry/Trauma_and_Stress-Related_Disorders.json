      "explanation": "The death of a spouse is rated the most significant life event with 100 life change units. Thomas \nHolmes and Richard Rahe constructed a social readjustment rating scale after ranking the relative \ndegree of adjustment required by changing life events. Each event is assigned a certain number of \nunits. Examples: • The death of a spouse- 100 life-change units • Divorce- 73 units • Marital separations- 65 units • The death of a close family member- 63 units • Marriage- 50 units Accumulation of 200 or more life-change units in a single year increases the risk of developing a \npsychosomatic disorder in that year. 223 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is a psychiatric \ndisorder occurring after a life-threatening or potentially fatal event, (e.g., war, house fire, serious \naccident, rape, robbery) affecting the patient or the patient’s close friend or relative. Symptoms can be divided into four types: • Re-experiencing (e.g., intrusive memories of the event [flashbacks] and nightmares) • Hyperarousal (e.g., anxiety, increased startle response, impaired sleep, hypervigilance) • Negative cognition (e.g., negative beliefs, emotional numbing) • Avoidance (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the traumatic event) Psychotherapies found to be effective for PTSD include exposure therapy, trauma-focused \ncognitive-behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization, and reprocessing.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is due to \nabnormally high activity in the amygdala, which makes the patients relive their traumatic \nmemories. The amygdala is responsible for the genesis of emotion, rating the emotional importance of an \nexperience and activating the hippocampus accordingly. Thus, an emotionally intense experience \nis imprinted in the memory. As a result, the traumatic memories lead to a state of constant \nvigilance, even in safe, familiar settings.",

A good prognosis is predicted by: • Rapid onset of the symptoms • Short duration of the symptoms (less than 6 months) • Good premorbid functioning • Strong social supports. • Absence of other psychiatric, medical, or substance-related disorders. In general, the very young and the very old have more difficulty with traumatic events than those \nin midlife. • Young children have inadequate coping mechanisms. • Older persons are likely to have more rigid coping mechanisms and less able to muster a flexible \napproach to dealing with the effects of trauma.",
