      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the scenario, the presence of one or more somatic symptoms for more than 6 months in the \nabsence of an organic cause is suggestive of somatic symptom disorder. DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder: • One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily \nlife. • Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health \nconcerns as manifested by at least one of the following: • Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms. • Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms. • Excessive time and energy are devoted to these symptoms or health concerns. • Although a single somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being \nsymptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months). Smith's consultation letter provides the primary care physicians with dos and don'ts during an \nencounters with patients with multiple medically unexplained physical symptoms. It suggests the \nfollowing: • Regularly scheduled appointments • Performing brief physical examinations focusing on the area of discomfort at each visit • Avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures, invasive treatments, and hospitalizations • Avoid using statements such as symptoms are all in your head • Encourage patients to talk about stressors Treatment is psychotherapy.",

      "question": "Question 3: A 25-year-old woman comes to the psychiatric OPD, convinced that she is suffering from a \nbrain tumor. She says she has been experiencing continuous headaches for the past 6 months. \nThough all investigations are normal, she continues to worry and asks the doctor to do some \nmore tests.

        "d": "Illness anxiety disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history of the patient preoccupied with thoughts of suffering from a disease \n(brain tumor) based on her interpretation of a benign headache for 6 months is suggestive of \nillness anxiety disorder i.e., hypochondriasis. DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder: • Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. • Somatic symptoms are absent or mild in intensity. If another medical condition is present or \nthere is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the \npreoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate. • The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her \nbody for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and \nhospitals). 239 \nSold by @itachibot • Preoccupation with illness for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may \nchange over that period of time. • The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder. Note: In illness anxiety disorder, the patient is preoccupied with a disease whereas, in somatic \nsymptom disorder, the patient is preoccupied with symptoms.",

A conversion disorder is an acute and temporary loss or alteration in motor or sensory function \ntriggered by psychosocial stress. Most of the patients have a history of traumatic events in \nchildhood. The symptoms or deficits of conversion disorder are not intentionally produced. There \nis a time difference seen between the stressors and symptoms. The channeling or conversion of the emotional arousal to physical symptoms is primary gain, \nwhile the benefits that come out of having the physical symptoms is the secondary gain. For \nexample, it forcing a spouse to stay in an otherwise failing marriage. La Belle indifference (beautiful indifference) refers to the patient's blissful indifference to what \nappears to be a significant impairment.",
