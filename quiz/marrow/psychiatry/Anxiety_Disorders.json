The purpose is to promote the habituation of fear \nin response to them. Example: Aerobic exercise to induce rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Breathing through \nthin straw produces a sensation of not getting enough air. Option B: Imaginal exposure typically involves having the patient close their eyes and imagine \nfeared stimuli. Option C: In vivo exposure involves helping patients directly confront feared objects, activities, \nand situations. Option D: Flooding approach involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high \nintensity without relaxation. 204 \nSold by @itachibot Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders",
