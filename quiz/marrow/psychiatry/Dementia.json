Option A: In Korsakoff syndrome, there is inactivation (not hyperactivation) of mammillary \nbodies due to thiamine deficiency. Option C: Alzheimer's disease initially affects the parietal and temporal lobe, followed by the \nfrontal lobe in the later stages. Hence personality changes are a late feature of Alzheimer's.
