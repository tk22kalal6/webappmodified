      "explanation": "Neither physical dependence nor withdrawal symptoms occur with LSD, but a user can develop a \npsychological dependence on the insight-inducing experiences of episodes of hallucinogen use. 187 \nSold by @itachibot Physical dependence indicates an altered physiological state due to repeated administration of a \ndrug, the cessation of which results in the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome characteristic of \nthe particular drug. Psychological dependence also referred to as habituation, is characterized by a continuous or \nintermittent craving (i.e., intense desire) for the substance to avoid a dysphoric state(state of \nunease or dissatisfaction with depression, anxiety, or agitation). The physical and psychological dependence potential of MDMA (3,4 \nmethylenedioxy-methamphetamine) is also not well established. It is an illegal, synthetic drug \nclassified as a stimulant with potentially hallucinogenic properties. Agents, known to cause strong physical and psychological dependence: • Opioids • Alcohol • Nicotine • Cannabis • Barbiturates",

IV Naloxone is administered at a slow rate. Signs of improvement (increased respiratory rate and \npupillary dilation) should occur promptly. If no response to the initial dosage, repeat after a few \nminutes. Repeated administration may be required to prevent recurrence of opioid toxicity \nbecause the duration of action of naloxone is less.",

Treatment for opioid dependence: Detoxification: • Long-acting opioid agonist - a safer substitute like methadone is given in a supervised manner to \nprevent withdrawal symptoms. • Partial agonist - buprenorphine can also be used. • Clonidine, lofexidine - alpha-2 agonist acts as sympatholytic and reduces the withdrawal \nsymptoms. Maintenance: • Methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM (L-Alpha-Acetyl-Methadol) - opioid agonists which reduce \ncraving. • Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that blocks opioid effects, particularly euphoria, and \ndiscourages persons with opioid dependence from substance-seeking behavior.",
