        "d": "Nymphomania"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Crossing over from one behavior to another is seen in paraphilia. For example, paraphilic persons \nprimarily involved with actual touching of victims (frottage, rape, and pedophilia) had \npreviously been involved in paraphilic acts not involving touching of the victim (voyeurism and \nexhibitionism). Paraphiliacs tend to cross over between touching and nontouching of their victims, between \nfamily and nonfamily members, between female and male victims, and to victims of various ages. Gender incongruence is characterized by a marked and persistent incongruence between an \nindividual's experienced gender and the assigned sex. This often leads to a desire to \nundergo hormonal treatment, surgery, or other health care services to make the individual's body \nalign with the experienced gender. Satyriasis is a sexual paraphilia where a male is affected with insatiable sexual desire. The same, \nwhen seen in a female, is called nymphomania.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The term paraphilia does not include homosexuality. It is considered to be a normal variant of \nhuman sexuality.

      "options": {
        "a": "Transvestism",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood (ICD-11) is characterized by a marked and \npersistent incongruence between an individual´s experienced gender and the assigned sex. This \noften leads to a desire to ‘transition’ through hormonal treatment, surgery, or other health care \nservices to make the individual´s body align with the experienced gender. The diagnosis cannot be assigned prior to the onset of puberty. Option A: Transvestism is described as fantasies and sexual urges to dress in opposite gender \nclothing as a means of arousal and as an adjunct to masturbation or coitus. Option B: Body dysmorphic disorder - persons wish to alter or remove a specific body part that \nthey perceive to be unattractive. Option D: Gender-queer - people who feel they are in between two genders, or of neither gender. Note: The diagnosis of transsexualism was renamed in ICD-11 as gender incongruence, and moved \nfrom the chapter on Mental and Behavioral Disorders to the Conditions Related to Sexual Health. \nAccording to DSM-5 it has now been replaced with the term gender dysphoria. 312 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Exhibitionistic disorder, also known as flashing or indecent exposure, is diagnosed when such \nbehaviors last for a period of 6 months or more. In exhibitionistic disorder, there is recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of \none’s genitals to an unsuspecting individual in public places.
