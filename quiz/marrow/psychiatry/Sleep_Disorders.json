      "explanation": "REM stage of sleeping is also known as paradoxical sleep. It is characterized by a high level of \nbrain activity and physiological activity, similar to those in wakefulness. In REM sleep, • Pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are increased. 262 \nSold by @itachibot • Brain oxygen use increases during REM sleep. • Thermoregulation is altered - Poikilothermia prevails during REM sleep. • There is loss of muscle tone - body movement is absent during REM sleep. • There is partial or full penile erection. • Dreams are abstract and surreal. Polygraphic measures during rapid eye movement sleep show irregular patterns, sometimes close \nto aroused waking patterns. In NREM sleep, physiological functions are markedly lower than in wakefulness.",

      "explanation": "The marked area in the given EEG shows sawtooth waves that are characteristic of REM sleep. Sleep is comprised of two distinct physiological states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep \nand REM sleep. Stages I to IV make up the NREM sleep with marked lower physiological \nfunctions than during wakefulness. Dreams which occur during this state are usually lucid and \npurposeful. REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity. The physiological activity is similar to \nthat during wakefulness. In REM sleep, • Pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are increased. • Brain oxygen use increases during REM sleep. • Thermoregulation is altered - Poikilothermia prevails during REM sleep. • There is loss of muscle tone - body movements are absent during REM sleep. • There is partial or full penile erection - This is used to evaluate the cause for impotence. • Dreams are abstract and surreal. In normal adults, a REM episode has a latency of about 90 minutes during which the sleep is in \nthe NREM stage. This latency is shortened in narcolepsy and depressive disorders. 264 \nSold by @itachibot",

It is seen in narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is the classical example of sleepiness caused due to CNS dysfunction of sleep \nmechanisms, mainly, a genetically triggered hypocretin deficit and dysfunction. Levels of hypocretin receptor-I are undetectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals who \nare HLA DQB 1*0602-positive (consistent with cataplexy-associated narcolepsy). The classic form of narcolepsy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) is characterized by a tetrad of \nsymptoms: • Excessive daytime sleepiness • Cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone) • Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations • Sleep paralysis Symptoms commonly appear in the second decade of life. Strong emotions (such as laughter and \nanger) usually act as the trigger for cataplexy. Pharmacotherapy remains the treatment of choice. Modafinil, an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist, \nis used to reduce the number of sleep attacks and to improve psychomotor performance in \nnarcolepsy.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while trying \nto fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night and \nmoving legs or walking reduces discomfort. Uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency and \nfolic acid–deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating \nfactors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, \ngabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, \nropinirole, rotigotine). FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: • Gabapentin • Ropinirole • Pramipexole • Rotigotine Note: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects \nfrom gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of \nmoderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a \nhistory of substance use disorder.",
