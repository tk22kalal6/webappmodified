      "explanation": "A crime should include both a guilty mind (aka intent) and an illegal act.

The act alone is not enough to be considered guilty. A crime may or may not have a motive (statement 3) or a plan of action (statement 4).",

        "d": "1, 2 and 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The mentally ill in cases 3, 4, and 5 will be exempted according to M'Naghten's rule. In a court of law to prove criminal liability against an accused with mental illness both mens rea \n(a guilty mind) and actus rea (an illegal act) at the point of time should be present when the crime \nwas committed. Case 3: The accused does not know the nature of his act and absence of motive or secrecy and \nshows unsoundness of mind in this case. Hence he is exempted. 353 \nSold by @itachibot Case 4: The delusion is judged as if it is real. The accused thought he was doing his job legally as \nthe state executioner. Hence he is exempted. Case 5: Epilepsy, schizophrenia, and paranoia are exempted in the court of law from criminal \nliability. In this case, the patient was probably in post-ictal state, and mens rea was absent. Thus, in cases 3, 4, and 5, the accused are medically insane and legally insane. Case 1: The accused killed his children out of severe disturbance. However, as per the law, the \ndisturbance is not considered to impair his thinking capacity. There was also no need for \nself-defense. Hence he would not be exempted. Case 2: The delusion is judged as if it is unreal (i.e., there is no delusion), because the patient was \ndeluded that the victim had killed his wife, but the motive to attempt the murder was out of \nrevenge which is illegal and hence, the person is not exempted. Thus, in cases 1 and 2, the people are medically insane, but not legally insane.",

      "question": "Question 5: A person suffering from which of the following conditions is criminally responsible?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Kleptomania",
        "b": "Somnambulism",
        "c": "Oneroid state",
        "d": "Delirium tremens"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A kleptomaniac is fully responsible for his crimes and is not exempted based on sec 84 IPC \n(McNaughten's rule), as McNaughten's rule in India considers only a defect of mind, reason, and \nintellectual capability. However, it does not consider emotions and control of impulses. Thus, a \nkleptomaniac is only mentally ill but not legally insane. The punishment for a kleptomaniac is given under the Doctrine of diminished responsibility. \nThis absolves an accused person of part of the liability for his criminal act, as their mental \nfunctions were \"diminished\" or impaired at that time. A person is not criminally responsible during states where mens rea (guilty mind) is absent due to \nthe unsoundness of the mind. The conditions for which this is applicable are: • Post-traumatic automatism • Somnambulism • Twilight state: Disordered consciousness during which actions may be performed unconsciously. • Oneroid State: dream-like disturbances of one's consciousness by hallucinations, accompanied \nby catatonic symptoms (either catatonic stupor or excitement) and delusions. • Delirium tremens",

        "d": "A person suffering from delusions of grandiosity cannot make a will"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A mentally ill person is indeed criminally responsible during the lucid interval. Lucid interval: The period of sanity or consciousness between two periods of insanity or \nunconsciousness. Seen in states like mania, melancholia, extradural hemorrhage. During this period, a mentally ill person: • Can give evidence. 354 \nSold by @itachibot • Is criminally responsible. • Has testamentary capacity. Testamentary capacity is the mental ability of a person to make a will. A person of a sound \ndisposing mind at the time of making the will (not necessarily always) can make a will. A person \nsuffering from an insane delusion can make a will if the delusion is not related in any way by the \ndisposal of property or the persons affected. For example: • Delusion of grandeur: cannot make a will, as they believe they possess more than they actually \ndo. • Delusion of persecution: might not be allowed to make a will, because it will affect who they \ndistribute their property to. • Somatic delusions: can make a will. Only has delusions of physical symptoms, who they \ndistribute their property to is not affected.",

      "question": "Question 8: A 37-year-old patient was admitted to a hospital independently for the treatment of \ndepression. During the stay, the patient attempted to hurt themselves. According to the \nMental Health Care Act, 2017, within how many hours should a repeat mental health \nassessment be carried out to reclassify the admission as a supported admission?",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "According to the Mental Health Care Act of 2017, the patient should be re-examined within 24 \nhours to re-classify the admission as supported admission. Mental Health Care Act 2017 classifies admissions as independent and supported. • Independent admissions refers to the admission of a person with mental illness, to a mental \nhealth establishment, who can make mental healthcare and treatment decisions or requires \nminimal support in making decisions. • Supported admissions refer to the admission and treatment of persons with mental illness, with \nhigh support needs, in mental health establishments. The medical officer or mental health professional must discharge any independently admitted \npatient immediately upon their request. However, under certain conditions, the discharge can be \ndelayed for 24 hours to allow for an assessment necessary to reclassify the patient under the \nsupported category. These conditions are: (a) the person is unable to understand the nature and purpose of their decisions and requires \nsubstantial or very high support from their nominated representative; or (b) the person has recently threatened or attempted or is threatening or attempting, to cause \nbodily harm to themselves; or (c) the person has recently behaved, or is behaving, violently towards another person or is causing \nanother person to fear bodily harm; or 355 \nSold by @itachibot (d) the person has recently shown or is showing, an inability to care for themselves to a degree \nthat places them at risk of harm. 356 \nSold by @itachibot",
