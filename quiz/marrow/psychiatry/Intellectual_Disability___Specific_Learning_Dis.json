      "explanation": "A person with an IQ of 40 will have a mental age of 6-8 years. Intellectual disability (ID) is said to be present when IQ&lt;70 and is classified as - • Mild Intellectual disability (50-69) • Are educable • Can study till 6th grade • They are successful and independent • They can do unskilled and semi-skilled work without supervision • Moderate Intellectual disability (35-49) • Trainable • Can study up to 2nd class • Have a mental age of 6-8 years • They can do unskilled and semiskilled work under supervision • Severe Intellectual disability (20-34) • They are dependent • Cannot be educated 318 \nSold by @itachibot • Have a mental age of 3-6 years • They can do simple tasks under supervision • Profound Intellectual disability (&lt;20) • Require continuous supervision and care • Have a mental age of 3 years Previously, IQ range of 70–90 was called \"Borderline intellectual functioning\". But DSM-5 has \neliminated this term. Contrary to earlier versions, IQ boundaries are no longer part of the \nclassification of ID in DSM-5.",

      "explanation": "According to DSM-5, the classification of severity of intellectual disability (ID) is assessed by \ndeficits in adaptive functioning (not IQ scores).

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given pedigree describes an X-linked recessive disorder. The genetic disorder associated with \nintellectual disability that follows the given pattern of inheritance is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The disorder results from mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine \nphosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), leading to deficient enzyme activity. This defect results in 319 \nSold by @itachibot increased uric acid production and hyperuricemia. Mode of inheritance of diseases causing intellectual disability: • Autosomal dominant: Apert syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Neurofibromatosis • Autosomal recessive: Galactosemia, Phenylketonuria, Homocystinuria, Hurler’s syndrome, \nTay-Sachs disease • X-linked recessive: Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Hunter’s syndrome. Note: Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disease. It has atypical pedigree features of an X-linked \nrecessive pattern. For instance, 30-50% of female carriers are affected by intellectual disability \nand have other features.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Contingency management is used in children with intellectual disabilities to teach daily and basic \nactivities. Contingency management is based on the notion that if any action is rewarded or appreciated \nthen it is more likely to occur in the future. This kind of intervention which aims at reinforcement \nis used to modify the behavior of children with intellectual disability. Punishment is not used. Cognitive behavioural therapy includes education, relaxation exercises, coping skills training, \nstress management, or assertiveness training. It is an evidence-based treatment for psychiatric \ndisorders including: • Depression 320 \nSold by @itachibot • Generalized anxiety disorder • Post-traumatic stress disorder • Panic disorder • Eating disorders • Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychodynamic therapy primarily relies on developing patient insight. It is based on the idea that \nchildhood experiences, past unresolved conflicts, and previous relationships significantly \ninfluence an individual’s current situation in life. It is usually used for the treatment of neurotic \ndisorders and personality disorders.",

Learning disability is a condition wherein the child presents with difficulty in learning academic \nskills despite a good education system. According to ICD-11, this can be classified as developmental learning disorders with: • Impairment in reading - Dyslexia is the most common type, characterized by difficulty in the \ndomains of reading fluency, word recognition, poor decoding, and spelling abilities. • Impairment in written expression - Dysgraphia • Impairment in mathematics - Dyscalculia Heller’s syndrome or disintegrative psychosis is typically seen in the age group of 3 to 5 years. \nThis neurodegenerative disease is characterized by a rapid downhill course, leading to \ndeterioration and development of neurological deficits.",
