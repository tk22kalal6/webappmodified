The given \nclinical history of binge-eating, body-image issues, Russell's sign along with a normal BMI is \nsuggestive of bulimia nervosa. The calluses on hands form due to the repeated scraping of knuckles on the teeth, during \nself-induced vomiting. Bulimia can be differentiated from anorexia nervosa by the following features: • The body weight is within the normal range. • Bulimia is seen in older age groups (late adolescents or adults). • Any peculiar eating habit (like dividing food into small portions) is not seen. • Amenorrhoea is not common. • Psychiatric symptoms such as depression are more common. Treatment of bulimia nervosa: • Without comorbid mood disorders- fluoxetine, topiramate, CBT • With comorbid mood disorders- carbamazepine",
