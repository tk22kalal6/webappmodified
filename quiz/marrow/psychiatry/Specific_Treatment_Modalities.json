      "explanation": "Increased intracranial tension is a relative contraindication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT was introduced as a treatment modality for schizophrenia by Ugo Cerletti. ECT is useful in \nthe treatment of: • Severe depression with suicidal risk (most common indication) • Treatment-resistant depression • Catatonia • Obsessive-compulsive disorder • Delirium • Episodic psychoses, atypical psychoses • Medical conditions such as: 54 \nSold by @itachibot • Neuroleptic malignant syndrome • Hypopituitarism • Intractable seizure disorders • The on-off phenomenon of Parkinson's disease. ECT may also be the treatment of choice for depressed suicidal pregnant women who require \ntreatment and cannot take medication.",

Lithium combined with ECT has been shown to cause prolonged seizures (lasting more than 180 \nsecs) and increased postictal delirium. Doses are withheld for 24 hours prior to treatment, \nallowing for washout. Medications to be withheld before ECT: • Lithium - causes prolonged seizures and increased postictal delirium • Benzodiazepines - anticonvulsant activity • Clozapine - associated with late-appearing seizures • Buproprion - associated with late-appearing seizures Medications that should not be used during ECT: • Lidocaine - markedly increases seizure threshold • Theophylline - increases the duration of seizures • Reserpine - further compromises RS and CVS Note: Tardive seizure is a rare complication of ECT. These are seizures that occur after the \ncompletion of treatment once the patient has regained consciousness. The use of -lactam \nantibiotics and ciprofloxacin has been associated with tardive seizures.",

      "explanation": "ECT consists of sessions that are scheduled 2-3 times weekly on nonconsecutive days. \nTwice-weekly treatments are associated with less memory impairment than thrice-weekly 55 \nSold by @itachibot treatments. For a seizure to be effective in the course of ECT, it should last at least 25 seconds. Treatment should continue until the patient achieves what is considered the maximal therapeutic \nresponse. The point of maximal improvement is usually thought to occur when a patient fails to \ncontinue to improve after two consecutive treatments. Further treatment does not yield any \ntherapeutic benefit but increases the severity and duration of the adverse effects.

The next step would be to test the validity of this automatic thought. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is based on the psychological significance of the cognitive \ntriad: • An individual's beliefs about themselves • Their personal world (including the people in their lives) • Their future. Problematic and biased interpretations related to this cognitive triad may lead to excessive \nemotional distress. CBT is applied to identify these faulty ideas and beliefs, make the patient aware of the underlying \nassumptions that drive them, and modifying their responses to them. The three components of cognitive therapy are: • Didactic aspects: Explaining to patients the cognitive triad, schemas, and faulty logic. The \ntherapist must explain all the aspects of treatment. • Cognitive techniques: These involve four steps- • Eliciting automatic thoughts - Asking the patient about the thought that causes the emotional \nreaction in them. • Testing validity of the automatic thoughts • Identifying the general maladaptive assumptions (a belief that is false and rationally \nunsupported) • Testing the validity of maladaptive assumptions • Behavioral techniques like relaxation techniques and desensitization to the stimulus etc. CBT is used in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, depression, phobia, OCD, personality \ndisorders, and somatoform disorders.",

The negative reaction of anxiety is inhibited by the \nrelaxed state, a process called reciprocal inhibition. • Hierarchy construction - Patients and therapists prepare a graded list (or hierarchy) of \nfear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety. • Desensitization of the stimulus - Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least \nto the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.

      "explanation": "Negative punishment is withholding the reward (permission to go and play) whenever the \nundesired behavior is manifested (not completing the homework). Operant conditioning is a learning process in which a particular behavior is modified by either \nresulting in a reward or punishment. It deals with voluntary responses because the respondent is \nfree to choose a behavior depending on the desired consequence. The image below shows Skinner's operant conditioning quadrant. 62 \nSold by @itachibot Types of Operant conditioning: Note: The question is about bad behavior i.e. not doing the homework. The focus is on decreasing \nbad behavior, hence the answer would be punishment (positive or negative). Reinforcement \n(either positive or negative) applies only to good behavior. Type \nBehavior \nStimulus \nExample Good behavior increas \ned Positive reinforceme \nnt When stimulus added. \nWhen a child studies, he is gi \nven chocolate. So, now he st \nudies every day to get the ch \nocolate. Good behavior increas \ned Negative reinforceme \nnt So that stimulus is avoided. \nA child studies to avoid getti \nng scolded by his mother. Positive punishment \nBad behavior decrease \nd When stimulus added. \nA child was given an impositi \non because he did not do his \nhomework. He does his hom \nework sincerely now. Negative punishment \nBad behavior decrease \nd So that stimulus is removed. \nA child fails to do his homew \nork, so he is not allowed to p \nlay. Next day onwards, he do \nes his homework every day.",

      "explanation": "Conditioning is not a stage of motivational enhancement therapy. The stages of motivational enhancement therapy: • Pre-contemplation - People are often unaware that their behavior (eg. alcohol abuse) is \nproblematic or produces negative consequences. 63 \nSold by @itachibot • Contemplation - People recognize their problem and begin to think about changing their \nbehavior. They weigh the pros and cons of change. People may still feel ambivalent toward \nchanging their behavior. • Preparation (Determination) - People have made a decision to change their habits and are ready \nto take action. People start to take small steps toward behavior change. • Action - People have recently changed their behavior and intend to keep moving forward with \nthat behavior change • Maintenance - People have sustained their behavior change for a while and intend to maintain \nthe behavior change going forward. People work to prevent relapse to earlier stages. Termination - In this stage, people have no desire to return to their unhealthy behaviors and are \nsure they will not relapse. Since this is rarely reached, people tend to stay in the maintenance \nstage.",

      "explanation": "In the given scenerio aversion therapy is used. Aversion: When a noxious stimulus/punishment is given after a specific behavior, the behavior is \neventually inhibited. It is used in the treatment of alcohol abuse, paraphilias, opioid addicts. Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde \ndehydrogenase. Ethanol consumption during disulfiram therapy can lead to increased \nconcentrations of acetaldehyde. Increased acetaldehyde levels can cause flushing, pulsating \nheadache, throbbing pain in head and neck, and other aversive reactions. Disulfiram can only be given to highly motivated individuals. It should not be administered until \nthe person has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. The disulfiram-alcohol reaction may \noccur as long as 1 or 2 weeks after the last dose of disulfiram. 64 \nSold by @itachibot Disulfiram like reaction with alcohol ingestion is also seen with the following drugs: • Metronidazole • Sulfonylureas like chlorpropamide • Cephalosporins like cefoperazone, cefamandole. 65 \nSold by @itachibot Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Systemic Disorders",
