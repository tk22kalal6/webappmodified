        "a": "Language impairment is a usual feature",
        "b": "It is never associated with intellectual disability",

        "d": "Patients may show an inflexible adherence to routines"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Intellectual disability is seen in about 30% of patients with autism. Autism or autistic diorder is a pervasive developmental disorder. Features usually start before 3 \nyears of age and is more common in boys. Autism is characterized by the 2 core features of autism \nspectrum disorder: deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of \nbehavior, interests, or activities. In addition, autism is also usually marked by language impairment, which occurs early in the \ndevelopmental period. However this is not a core feature. Below-normal intelligence is seen in about 30% of children with autistic disorder. However, some \nautistic children have unusual abilities in some areas (e.g., exceptional memory or calculation \nskills). These are referred to as savant skills.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Aberrant language development and intellectual disability are not part of the core diagnostic \ncriteria for autism spectrum disorder, according to the DSM-5 update. Core diagnostic impairments in autism spectrum disorders according to DSM-5 are collapsed into \ntwo domains: 1. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts: • Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity • Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors (e.g. eye contact, body language, use of gestures, \nand facial expressions) • Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g. difficulties in sharing, \nimaginative play, or in making friends) 2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two \nof the following: • Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g. simple motor \nstereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia) 325 \nSold by @itachibot • Inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns and behavior (e.g. extreme distress at \nsmall changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns) • Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g, strong \npreoccupation with unusual objects) • Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, \nadverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual \nfascination with lights or movement).",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Children with autism spectrum disorder do not show early handedness and lateralization and \nremain ambidextrous at an age when cerebral dominance is established in most children. Other findings that may be present in autism spectrum disorders (not core diagnostic criteria) \ninclude: • Higher incidence of abnormal dermatoglyphics (e.g., fingerprints) • Deficits in language development • Intellectual disability • Hypo/hyper-response to sensory stimuli (e.g., no response to loud sound/ keen response to \nticking of a watch) • Hyperactivity and inattention • Precocious skills (e.g., prodigious route memories or calculating abilities) • Insomnia",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a 3-year-old female with normal psychomotor development until 6 \nmonths followed by regression in development, stereotyped movements, and microcephaly is \nsuggestive of Rett syndrome. The gene associated with Rett syndrome is the MECP-2 gene. It is an X-linked dominant condition. It is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein \n2 or MECP2. This condition is extremely rare in males. Features of Rett Syndrome: • Apparently normal prenatal and perinatal period and apparently normal psychomotor \ndevelopment through the first 5 months and normal head circumference at birth. • Deceleration of head growth between 5 months and 4 years and loss of acquired purposeful hand \nskills between 5 and 30 months of age. • Severe impairment of expressive and receptive language, together with severe psychomotor \nretardation. 326 \nSold by @itachibot • Stereotyped midline hand movements (such as hand-wringing or \"hand-washing\") with an onset \nat or after the time when purposeful hand movements are lost.",

CDD is also called Heller's syndrome or disintegrative psychosis. It is characterized by a \nsignificant developmental regression resulting in deterioration in behavioral and adaptive \nfunctioning including self-help skills with loss of language and social skills after a period of \nnormal development for at least two years. It is also associated with features of dementia and \nsignificant intellectual disability. It is now included under autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5 manual, and ICD-11 also.",
