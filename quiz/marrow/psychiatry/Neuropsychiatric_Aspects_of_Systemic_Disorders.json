      "explanation": "Anton syndrome is characterized by cortical blindness with confabulation. Confabulation refers to the unconscious filling of gaps in memory with inaccurate, fabricated, and \noften implausible information. 71 \nSold by @itachibot Anton syndrome occurs due to occipital lobe damage. Here, the patient denies loss of vision \n(known as visual anosognosia) and defends it by confabulation even when there is obvious \nevidence of visual loss and cortical blindness. Other causes of confabulation: • Wernicke’s Korsakoff syndrome • Traumatic brain injury Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by predominant anterograde amnesia and some retrograde \namnesia. Confabulation is present in order to cover the memory deficit. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Psychogenic amnesia does not present with confabulation.",
