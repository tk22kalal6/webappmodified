      "explanation": "Intermittent explosive disorder manifests as discrete episodes of losing control of aggressive \nimpulses. The symptoms, which patients may describe as spells or attacks, appear within minutes \nor hours and, regardless of duration, remit spontaneously and Žuickly. One discrete episode does \nnot justify the diagnosis. A minimum age of è years is reŽuired to diagnose this condition and it is more commonly seen in \nmen than women. These episodes can result in serious assault or the destruction of property. The \naggressiveness expressed is grossly out of proportion to any stressors that may have helped elicit \nthe episodes. After each episode, patients usually show genuine regret or self-reproach. Signs of generalized \nimpulsivity or aggressiveness are absent between episodes.",

      "explanation": "Serotonin is believed to be the neurotransmitter that plays a major role in intermittent explosive \ndisorder. Serotonergic neurons mediate behavioral inhibition. The restoration of serotonin activity, by \nadministering serotonin precursors such as L-tryptophan or drugs that increase synaptic \nserotonin levels, restores the behavioral effect of punishment and controls episodic violent \ntendencies. êote: Low CS‘ 5-HIAA (hydroxy-indoleacetic acid) levels have been correlated with impulsive \naggression. 289 \nSold by @itachibot Psychiatric Emergencies",
