      "explanation": "In the scenario, the female patient has an excessive desire for sexual intercourse i.e., \nhypersexuality. This is called nymphomania. It is sometimes classified as a form of sex addiction. Satyriasis is uncontrollable or excessive sexual desire (hypersexuality) in males. In some \nmen, sexual activity is a means to mask their deep feelings of inferiority. Some have unconscious \nhomosexual impulses, which they deny by compulsive sexual contact with women. Many of them \nare no longer interested in women after sex. It is also known as Don Juanism. Don Juan is a \nlegendary, fictional libertine who devoted his life to seducing women. Voyeurism/Peeping Tom/scopophilia is sexual gratification by secretly watching others getting \nundressed, taking bath, having sexual intercourse, etc. Troilism is getting sexual gratification by watching his own wife performing sexual intercourse \nwith another man.",

Normally, men and women experience \na sequence of physiological responses to sexual stimulation. • Desire phase - consists of sex fantasies and the desire to have sex. • Excitement/Arousal phase - heightened excitement before orgasm (longest phase) • Orgasmic phase - a subjective perception of a peak physical reaction and release occurs, along \nwith a feeling of well-being (shortest phase) • Resolution phase - return to the baseline Following orgasm, men experience a refractory period during which they cannot be restimulated \nto further arousal. Women do not have a refractory period and can experience multiple, successive \norgasms.",

      "explanation": "Seman's stop-start technique is used for premature ejaculation, to prolong the time period until \nejaculation. Seman's technique (stop-start technique): A man approaches the point close to climax and then \nstops and relaxes before starting again. This method prolongs the time before ejaculation by \nrelying on behaviour modification. Other treatments for premature ejaculation: • Squeeze technique (by Master and Johnson's)- as a man approaches a climax, he squeezes the tip \nof the penis just below the head of the penis. The pressure is held there until the sensation of \nimpending orgasm diminishes. The process can then be started over again so that over time a man \nprolongs the time period until he reaches ejaculation. • Sensate focusing - refocussing on the non-coital aspects of sexual activity. • Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - delays ejaculation. e.g.- dapoxetine, paroxetine. 308 \nSold by @itachibot Sexual Disorders and Sexual Abuse",
