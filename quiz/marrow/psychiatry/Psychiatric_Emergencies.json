      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The technique shown in the above image is of 'breathing in a bag' technique. It relieves \nhypocapnia in hyperventilation syndrome. Hyperventilation syndrome is a habit of hyperventilation due to stress or any emotional upheaval. Symptoms occur due to hypocapnia/hypocarbia due to carbon dioxide washout: • Fatigue, dizziness, headache • Chest pain, palpitations, sweating • If severe - carpopedal spasms, paraesthesias, and loss of consciousness may occur. Acute \nhypocarbia causes respiratory alkalosis and reduced ionized calcium, resulting in hypocalcemic \nsymptoms. The patient has a typical history of stress followed by symptoms and frequently 'sighs' during the \ninterview. Treatment for hyperventilation-associated hypocapnia is breathing in a bag. The patient is told to \nbreathe in and out of a bag so that they rebreathe the expired air. This increases the levels of \narterial CO2 and quickly reverts the symptoms.",

The patient was started on clozapine two \nweeks back for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. His oral examination reveals the following \npicture.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of high-grade fever and pharyngitis and the simultaneous development \nof oral ulcers (image) in a patient on clozapine is suggestive of drug-induced agranulocytosis. The \ntreatment is to stop clozapine immediately, administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor \n(G-CSF), and start empirical antibiotics. Agranulocytosis is a rare, but fatal complication of clozapine. It is defined as an absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500/mm3, or white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 2000/mm3. It can \ninitially manifest as a local infection with high-grade fever, sore throat, oral and perianal \nulcerations. These symptoms appear rapidly within days to weeks following initiation of drug therapy. Clozapine is generally considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs and is often \nused in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychotic \ndrugs). Hence, a switch from clozapine to another (less effective) antipsychotic drug is not done in \na patient with drug-induced agranulocytosis. 295 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Tyramine is involved the pathogenesis of the condition."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cheese reaction, not serotonin syndrome. Here, the \npatient on phenelzine (non-selective and irreversible MAO-inhibitor) developed the clinical \nfeatures of cheese reaction on having a tyramine-rich food item (red wine, cheese, milk). Inhibition of the MAO-A isoform prevents the metabolism of dietary tyramine in the gut, thus \nallowing intact tyramine to enter the systemic circulation. It is taken up by adrenergic neurons \nand a hypertensive crisis occurs as a result of a powerful pressor effect of tyramine. The drug of choice to treat hypertensive crisis in cheese reaction is phentolamine. MAO-inhibitor with SSRI causes serotonin syndrome. Symptoms are fever, altered mental status, \nrigidity, hyperreflexia, and autonomic dysfunction. Selegiline and rasagiline do not functionally inhibit MAO-A. They do not cause cheese reaction \nwith doses used in clinical practice.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The clinical features in a patient who has been administered haloperidol, are most likely \nsuggestive of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening complication that can occur anytime \nduring antipsychotic treatment. Haloperidol poses the highest risk for causing NMS. The \ncondition may occur within 24-72 hrs after initiation of the treatment, and if untreated, may last \nfor 10 to 14 days. Option A: Serotonin syndrome occurs due to an increase of plasma serotonin to toxic levels, due \nto concurrent administration of SSRI and an MAO inhibitor, L-tryptophan or lithium. It is characterized by 3 A’s: • Neuromuscular hyperactivity - clonus, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, tremor, and seizure • Autonomic stimulation - hyperthermia, diaphoresis, diarrhoea • Agitation. In severe cases, there may be delirium, coma, status epilepticus, and death. Option B: Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by abnormal, irregular, involuntary choreoathetoid \nmovements of the muscles of the head, limbs, and trunk. Perioral movement is most common. \nThe condition usually develops as a delayed response to antipsychotics, about 6 months after \ntreatment. Option C: Hypersensitivity reaction to haloperidol may include anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema, facial and laryngeal oedema, rash, urticaria, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm.",
