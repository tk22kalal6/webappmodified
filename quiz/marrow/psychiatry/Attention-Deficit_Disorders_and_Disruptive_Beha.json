      "explanation": "The most common symptom of ADHD is hyperactivity. 331 \nSold by @itachibot The most cited characteristics of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in \norder of frequency, are as follows: • Hyperactivity (fidgety, unable to sit still, as though driven by a motor, hyper-talkative, \ninterrupts, blurts out answers) • Attention deficit (short attention span, distractibility, perseveration, failure to finish tasks, \ninattention, poor concentration) • Impulsivity (action before thought, abrupt shifts in activity, lack of organization, jumping up in \nclass) • Memory and thinking deficits. Intellectual disability is not seen in ADHD. • Specific learning disabilities • Speech and hearing deficits",

      "explanation": "Functional neuroimaging studies show frontal lobe hypometabolism in patients with ADHD. The frontal lobe maintains attention, arousal, or the establishment and maintenance of an awake \nstate. This appears to require at least three brain regions: • Ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) • Intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus • Frontal lobes In ADHD, although no specific pathological lesions are found in the ARAS, thalamic or cortical \nlevel, functional neuroimaging indicates frontal lobe hypometabolism.",
