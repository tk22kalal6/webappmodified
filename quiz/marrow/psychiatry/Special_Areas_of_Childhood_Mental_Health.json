      "question": "Question 1: A 4-year-old orphan child does not seem to seek comfort during times of distress. Even when \ncomforted, the child doesn't seem to be interested in it. This behaviour has been present for \nmore than a year noticed by caregivers when he was shifted between multiple foster homes. \nWhat is the most probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Disinhibited social engagement disorder",
        "b": "Autism spectrum disorder",
        "c": "Reactive attachment disorder",
        "d": "Intellectual disability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario suggests reactive attachment disorder. Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by the following: • A pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers manifested as: • The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed. • The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed. • A persistent social and emotional disturbance involving any two of the following: • Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others. • Limited positive affect. • Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness are evident even during \nnonthreatening interactions with adult caregivers. • The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care (evident by early separation, \nfrequent change in caregivers, institutionalization or neglect) • The disturbance is evident before 5 years of age and the developmental age of the child is at least \n9 months. Option A - Disinhibited social engagement disorder is a condition where the child approaches and \ninteracts with unfamiliar adults in either overly familiar behavior, has diminished checking back \nwith caregiver after venturing away (even in unfamiliar settings), with the willingness to go off \nwith an unfamiliar adult. Option B - Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficits in social communication and \ninteraction across multiple contexts as manifested by deficits in socio-emotional reciprocity, \ndifficulty in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships, and deficits in non verbal \ncommunicative behaviors. Option D - Children with intellectual disabilities have deficits in adaptive functioning which, \nwithout support, limit functioning in activities of daily life (communication, social participation, \nindependent living) across multiple environments. They are also characterized by having deficits \nin intellectual functions (reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment etc.)",

      "question": "Question 2: Which of the following is false about pica?",

        "a": "2 years is the minimum age for diagnosis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Pica is defined as the persistent eating of nonnutritive substances. It can emerge in children, \nadolescents, or adults (usually pregnant women). A minimum of 2 years of age is suggested by DSM-5 for the diagnosis of pica. Pica is more common among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and \nintellectual disability. The clinical implications can be benign or life-threatening, depending on the objects ingested. \nAmong the most serious complications are: • Lead poisoning - usually after ingestion of lead-based paint 346 \nSold by @itachibot • Intestinal parasites - after ingestion of soil or feces • Anemia and zinc deficiency - after ingestion of clay • Intestinal obstruction - from the ingestion of hairballs, stones, or gravel. No definitive treatment exists for pica. Most treatment is aimed at education and behavior \nmodification. Medical complications that develop secondarily to the pica must be treated.",

      "explanation": "Bargaining is not a phase of child sexual abuse. It is one of the stages of grief. Sexual abuse of a child that occurs over a period of time evolves through the following five phases: • Engagement- The perpetrator induces the child into a special relationship. • Sexual interaction- The sexual behaviors progress from less to more intrusive forms of abuse. • Secrecy- The perpetrator threatens the victim not to tell. • Disclosure- The abuse is discovered accidentally (when another person walks into the room and \nsees it) or through the child's reporting it to a responsible adult or via medical attention. • Suppression- The child often retracts the statements of the disclosure because of family pressure \nor because of the child's own mental processes.",

      "explanation": "347 \nSold by @itachibot According to the given history, the child has nocturnal enuresis, and hence consulting a child \npsychologist is the most appropriate option. Nocturnal enuresis refers to the occurrence of involuntary voiding at night after 5 years of age. If there are no daytime symptoms and physical and urine examinations are normal, then further \nevaluation for urinary tract pathology is not warranted. USG is done in an older child (usually \n&gt;7 years) with enuresis or in those who do not respond to therapy. Active treatment should be avoided in children younger than 6 years of age. Treatment includes \nthe following: • Psychological therapy includes motivational therapy (star charts), conditioning therapies like \nauditory or vibratory alarms (most effective). • Pharmacological therapy (imipramine and desmopressin) is intended to treat the symptoms of \nenuresis and thus is regarded as second-line and is not curative.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The clinical features are suggestive of nocturnal enuresis. Bell and pad based classical \nconditioning is the most effective treatment. Nocturnal enuresis refers to the occurrence of involuntary urination at night after 5 years of age. \nIt may be a normal phenomenon in children up to 5 years of age. Treatment for nocturnal enuresis may include: Behavioural therapy: • Classic conditioning with the bell (or buzzer) and pad (alarm) apparatus is the most effective \ntreatment for enuresis. • Dryness is achieved in 50% of the cases. • Bladder training with encouragement or reward for delaying micturition for increasing times \nduring waking hours is useful but considered inferior to bell and pad. Pharmacotherapy: • Medications should be considered if behavioural therapy has failed, and if enuresis is causing \nimpairment in social, family, and school function. 348 \nSold by @itachibot • Desmopressin (an antidiuretic) and Reboxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are \ncommonly used drugs. Reboxetine is considered as a safer alternative to imipramine. Psychotherapy: • It is indicated in cases with chronic enuresis, to deal with any coexisting psychiatric problems \nand emotional and family difficulties.",

Selective mutism refers to the lack of speaking (being mute) in one or more specific social \nsituations, commonly in school, but speaking well in other situations, commonly at home. The \nchild may be either completely silent at school or maybe just whispering. Rarely, a child may be \nsilent at home but communicating normally at school. The disorder may develop in children between 4 to 8 years of age and is associated with a social \nanxiety disorder. They may have symptoms of separation anxiety disorder, school refusal, and \ndelayed language acquisition. The first-line treatment includes cognitive behavioural therapy. Option A and B: selective mutism is not commonly associated with childhood depression or \npsychosis Option D: Hyperkinetic disorder is associated with overfamiliarity. 349 \nSold by @itachibot Forensic Psychiatry",
