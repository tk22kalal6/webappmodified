Male patients \ncomplain of premature ejaculation or impotence and believe that they are passing semen in their \nurine. In their tradition, semen is described as a \"vital fluid\". The discharge of this \"vital fluid\" \nthrough sex or masturbation is associated with anxiety and dysphoria. It is characterized by the \ncomplaint of the passage of dhat (whitish discharge: semen) in urine, multiple somatic symptoms, \nphysical/mental exhaustion, and sexual dysfunction. It is based on the belief that semen \nis precious and that loss of semen leads to exhaustion and weakness.
