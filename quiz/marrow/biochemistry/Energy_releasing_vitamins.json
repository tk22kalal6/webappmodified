      "explanation": "Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) does not serve as the coenzyme for isocitrate dehydrogenase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the citric acid cycle, uses Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions as a \ncoenzyme. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), from vitamin B1, serves as the coenzyme for three multienzyme \ncomplexes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions: • Pyruvate dehydrogenase - carbohydrate metabolism • -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase - citric acid cycle • Branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase - metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, valine Most of these enzymes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, so thiamine is required in excess \nduring a high carbohydrate diet. TPP also serves as the cofactor for transketolase in the HMP \nshunt.",

      "explanation": "Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency makes a patient prone to lactic acidosis. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) serves as a coenzyme for the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. In \na state of thiamine deficiency, there is an impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. When \nthe patient consumes a high carbohydate diet, there is thus an accumulation of pyruvate. Pyruvate \nthen gets converted into lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This results in increased \nplasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, leading to a state of lactic acidosis. 338 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Decreased energy production is seen in thiamine deficiency because it acts as a coenzyme for \npyruvate dehydrogenase and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Both pyruvate dehydrogenase and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are required for the production \nof NADH, which is used for ATP production. In thiamine deficiency, the reaction catalyzed by \npyruvate dehydrogenase cannot go forward. Hence, there is no formation of acetyl CoA, causing \ndecreased substrate for the citric acid cycle. As a result, energy (ATP) production is grossly \nreduced and instead, lactic acidosis is seen.",

Patients often have the Casal collar or Casal necklace. It is a clinical sign in which \nthere is an erythematous pigmented skin rash in the distribution of a broad collar (dermatomes \nC3 and C4). If left untreated, pellagra leads to the 4th D of death. Jowar (sorghum) has high leucine content. This inhibits QPRTase, an enzyme responsible for the \nsynthesis of niacin from amino acid tryptophan. Excessive consumption of maize-based diets can \nalso cause pellagra due to their low levels of niacin and tryptophan.",

Pellagra-like symptoms are not seen in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Pellagra is caused by niacin deficiency, either due to dietary deficiency or deficient conversion of \ntryptophan to niacin. Hence, pellagra-like symptoms are seen in: • Hartnup disease: It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the SLC6A19 gene \nleading to defective membrane transport of tryptophan across PCT (kidney) and enterocytes \n(intestine). This leads to malabsorption, and hence deficiency of tryptophan. • Carcinoid syndrome: Due to excess conversion of tryptophan to serotonin, there is a decreased \nlevel of tryptophan availavle for niacin synthesis • Pyridoxine deficiency: Pyridoxine is required as the co-factor of kynureninase, an enzyme in the \npathway of niacin synthesis. 341 \nSold by @itachibot • Maize/corn rich diet: In these grans, niacin is in bound form (niacytin form) and is not absorbed. • Jowar diet (Sorghum): The increased leucine content inhibits QPRTase enzyme, an enzyme in \nthe pathway of niacin synthesis.",

It is caused by niacin/vitamin B3 \ndeficiency. Hence, one should ask for a history of diarrhea and memory loss in this case. Pellagra presents with 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and if untreated, Death. Early \nsymptoms of pellagra are loss of appetite, generalized weakness and irritability, abdominal pain, \nand vomiting. Photosensitive dermatitis is seen over sun-exposed areas. Diarrhea occurs due to \nproctitis or malabsorption. Bright red glossitis (beefy tongue) and Casal’s necklace (a pigmented, \nscaly skin rash that forms a ring around the neck) follow. Depressive psychosis and dementia also \ncommonly occur. Corn/ maize/ jowar based diets are the main causes of niacin deficiency. Corn/maize lacks niacin \nand tryptophan. The excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to \nniacin. Niacin deficiency is also seen in alcoholism. Hence, additional histories of diarrhea and \nmemory loss will aid in supporting the diagnosis of pellagra (along with dietary history). Treatment includes oral supplementation with 100–200 mg of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid \nthree times daily for 5 days. Option B: Thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) features include CVS manifestations like heart failure \nand edema (wet beriberi), peripheral neuritis (dry beriberi), and Wernicke encephalopathy (in \nalcoholics). Option C: Dermatitis seen in pellagra is due to dietary deficiency of niacin and so allergy history is \nnot relevant. Option D: Conjunctivitis is not a feature of niacin deficiency.",

      "explanation": "Niacin increases the level of HDL. Niacin (vitamin B3) is known to inhibit lipolysis within the adipose tissue. Hence, the circulating \nfree fatty acids (FFAs) are reduced. The liver normally uses these circulating FFAs as a precursor \nin the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). As a result, niacin causes a reduction in liver TAG \nsynthesis. TAGs are in turn required for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density \nlipoprotein (LDL) synthesis. Therefore both plasma VLDL and LDL values are reduced. Overall, \nniacin decreases LDL, VLDL and TAG levels, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. \nThus it is particularly useful in the treatment of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both \nVLDL and LDL are elevated.",
