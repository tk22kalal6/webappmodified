      "explanation": "Generalised weakness, easy fatigability, itching and jaundice with a palpable upper abdominal \nmass is suggestive of pancreatic malignancy leading to obstructive jaundice. This gives a direct \npositive result on Van den Bergh reaction. In obstructive jaundice, obstruction of the biliary tree causes regurgitation of conjugated bilirubin \ninto the blood. Patients present with itching, jaundice and pale coloured stools. Van den Bergh reaction is a colorimetric method to measure the serum bilirubin level. It is based \non the formation of red azodipyrroles when diazotized sulfanilic acid reacts with bilirubin.

      "question": "Question 22: An adult male patient presents with yellow discolouration of the sclera. There was a history of \nrecurrent mild jaundice since childhood. His lab values are mentioned below. A liver biopsy \nwas performed which revealed normal liver architecture with coarse granular black \npigmentation. The mutation of which protein is involved in the following condition?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Yellow discolouration of the sclera with coarse granular black pigmentation of the liver is \nsuggestive of Dubin–Johnson syndrome, characterized by a mutation in the MRP-2 protein. Dubin–Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with predominantly conjugated \nhyperbilirubinemia. It is due to a defect in the active transport of bilirubin across the canalicular \nmembrane, due to a mutation in the MRP-2 protein. It is also known as black liver jaundice due to \nthe accumulation of a dark pigment, derived from epinephrine metabolites, in the lysosomes of \ncentrilobular hepatocytes. Bromosulpthalein test on plasma shows 2 peaks. Option A: OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are mutated in Rotor syndrome. It is due to defective bilirubin \nexcretion and causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option B: BSEP protein is mutated in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC type-2) \nand benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC-2). Option C: MRP-3 is mutated in PFIC type-3.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A young adult with a short history of jaundice following a period of stress (viral fever) with \nunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia likely has Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome most commonly \noccurs due to promoter defect of the UGT1A1 enzyme. Gilbert syndrome is caused by a defect in the promoter region of the gene coding for the \nUDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) enzyme. This results in a variable rate of transcription of \nthe normal enzyme. UGT1A1 activity is reduced to 10-33% of normal. It presents with periods of \nmild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with other liver function tests being normal. The disorder \nis precipitated by stress, alcohol and reduced caloric intake. 281 \nSold by @itachibot Liver histology shows increased lipofuscin pigment. It responds well to phenobarbitone. Gilbert's \nsyndrome doesn't require treatment. The bilirubin levels may fluctuate over time, and patients \nmay occasionally have jaundice, which usually resolves on its own with no ill effects.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Urine urobilinogen is not increased in obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice has the following features: • Absent urinary urobilinogen: In complete obstruction of the biliary tree, conjugated bilirubin \ncannot enter the intestine. Thus it is not metabolized by the intestinal flora and urobilinogen is \nnot formed. • Increased serum direct bilirubin: Due to obstruction in the biliary tree, the bilirubin conjugates \ndiffuse into the blood causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. • Increased urine bilirubin: Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and thus appears in the urine in \nexcess amounts. Option A: Urine bilirubin is absent in hemolytic jaundice because unconjugated bilirubin is not \nwater-soluble. Option C: Criggler-Najjar syndrome, due to absent UGT1A1 activity, presents with raised \nunconjugated bilirubin. Option D: Hepatocellular jaundice can have decreased urine urobilinogen if micro-obstruction \noccurs due to swollen, damaged hepatocytes. 282 \nSold by @itachibot Enzymes - Mechanism of Action & Clinical Importance",
