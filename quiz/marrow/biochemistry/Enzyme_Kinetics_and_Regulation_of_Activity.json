      "explanation": "Activation energy is the free energy difference between the substrate and transition state. Activation energy is defined as the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction. Because \nof the high activation energy, the rates of uncatalyzed chemical reactions are often slow. In an \nenzyme-catalyzed reaction, the activation energy is reduced by forming a relatively stable \nintermediate-enzyme complex. Thus, enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions. 305 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The above reaction has 2nd order for the forward reaction and 1st order for the reverse reaction. The sum of the molar ratios of the reactants defines the kinetic order of the reaction. In the forward reaction, A + A   P, the sum of reactants is 2. Thus, Rate  [A] [A] or Rate  [A]2 Therefore, the reaction is said to be second order with respect to reactant A. In the reverse reaction, P  2 A, the sum of reactants is 1. Thus, Rate  [P] Therefore, the reaction is said to be first order with respect to reactant P. Kinetic order of reactions: • Zero-order reaction: Rate is independent of the concentration of reactants. • First-order reaction: Rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one of the reactants. • Second-order reaction: In the simplest kind of 2nd order reaction, the rate is proportional to the \nsquare of the concentration of one reactant.",

In this reaction, the substrate concentration becomes 1000 times i.e much greater than the Km \nvalue. Thus, the rate of this reaction is equal to Vmax and is thus independent of the substrate \nconcentration i.e. it follows zero-order kinetics. Thus, doubling the substrate concentration does \nnot change the velocity of the reaction i.e. it remains as Vmax. No matter the substrate concentration, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the \nconcentration of the enzyme. In this situation the enzyme concentration becomes 1/3rd.

Step 1: Km of each option after converting respective units to moles will be 10, 2, 2 and 4 (each \nmultiplied by 10-6) moles. Step 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km. On substituting the values in various \noptions after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 100 and 50 (each multiplied by \n106) M-1 s-1. Some enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They \nare limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These \nare called diffusion-limited enzymes and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 108 M-1 s-1. 317 \nSold by @itachibot Fat soluble vitamins",

      "question": "Q10 = 2 is the correct statement regarding enzyme kinetics. The temperature coefficient (Q10) is the factor by which the rate of a biologic process increases for \na 10°C increase in temperature. The rates of most biological processes typically double for a 10°C \nrise in temperature. 306 \nSold by @itachibot Thus, Q10 (degree celsius rise) = 2 (double). Solution to Question 4: Ionization is not a type of covalent modification regulating enzyme kinetics. Regulation of enzyme kinetics can be brought about by reversible covalent modifications of the \nenzyme. These include methylation, acetylation, ADP ribosylation, phosphorylation and partial \nproteolysis. Solution to Question 5: The plot of initial reaction velocity against substrate concentration is hyperbolic, not linear. For a typical enzyme, the velocity of a reaction has a hyperbolic relationship with the substance \nconcentration. As the substrate concentration increases, initial velocity (Vi) increases until it \nreaches a maximum value Vmax. After Vmax is reached, further increase in the substrate \nconcentration does not change reaction velocity. This is because the enzyme is saturated with the \nsubstrate. The Michaelis constant (Km) is the substrate concentration at which Vi is half the maximal \nvelocity i.e. Vmax/2. The Michaelis-Menten equation illustrates the relationship between Vi and \nsubstrate concentration [S] mathematically i.e, Vi = Vmax × [S] / Km + [S] Solution to Question 6: The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme is expressed as Kcat/Km. 307 \nSold by @itachibot Kcat is the rate constant, which is the limiting rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at saturation. \nIt is given by Vmax divided by number of active sites of the enzyme. Km is the \nMichaelis-Menten constant, which is defined as the substrate concentration at which the initial \nvelocity(Vi) is half the maximum velocity (Vmax/2). For some enzymes, when a substrate (S) binds to the active site of the enzyme (E), and forms an \nenzyme-substrate complex (ES), the product is instantaneously formed. For such enzymes, the \nreaction of E+S ES becomes the rate-limiting step. Its rate is determined on the rate of diffusion \nof the molecules in a solution. Hence, these enzymes are called diffusion-limited or \ncatalytically perfect. Examples of the catalytically perfect enzymes, where the catalytic efficiency reaches the diffusion \nlimit of 108-109 M1s1: • Triosephosphate isomerase • Carbonic anhydrase • Acetylcholinesterase • Adenosine deaminase Solution to Question 7: The time taken for the formation of the same amount of product is 27 minutes. In this reaction, the substrate concentration becomes 1000 times i.e much greater than the Km \nvalue. Thus, the rate of this reaction is equal to Vmax and is thus independent of the substrate \nconcentration i.e. it follows zero-order kinetics. Thus, doubling the substrate concentration does \nnot change the velocity of the reaction i.e. it remains as Vmax. No matter the substrate concentration, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the \nconcentration of the enzyme. In this situation the enzyme concentration becomes 1/3rd. Thus, the \nvelocity of the reaction (Vmax) also becomes 1/3rd. This means that the time taken for the \nformation of the same amount of product will become tripled i.e 9 × 3 = 27 minutes. 308 \nSold by @itachibot Solution to Question 8: Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase reaction by malonate is an example of competitive \ninhibition. Solution to Question 9: Vmax remains constant in competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibition is when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the substrate-binding site and \ncompetes with the substrate for the active enzyme-binding site. This effect of competitive \ninhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration by which maximum velocity \ncan still be achieved. Therefore, Vmax (maximum velocity of the reaction) is unaltered in this type \nof inhibition. However, the concentration of the substrate required to achieve half of the \nmaximum velocity is increased. Therefore, Km is increased in this condition. Solution to Question 10: Km remains constant in noncompetitive inhibition. Non-competitive inhibition of enzymes occurs by the binding of inhibitors to enzymes in locations \ndifferent from the active site. The inhibition is not overcome by increasing the concentration of \nthe substrate. Thus, noncompetitive inhibitors decrease the Vmax of the reaction. Non-competitive inhibtiors do not resemble the substrate. Thus, they do not interfere with the \nbinding of the substrate to the enzyme. Thus, Km of the enzyme does not change. 309 \nSold by @itachibot Solution to Question 11: The red line indicates an enzymatic reaction taking place in the presence of a competitive \ninhibitor. The graph represents the enzymatic reaction velocity in relation to substrate concentration. The \nblack line indicates the reaction taking place in the absence of any inhibitor. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, as indicated by the red line, • Vmax remains unchanged. • Km is increased. In the presence of a non-competitive inhibitor, as indicated by the blue line, • Vmax is decreased 310 \nSold by @itachibot • Km remains unchanged Note: Suicide inhibitors are specialized substrate analogs. They contain a chemical group that can be \ntransformed by the target enzyme. After binding to the active site of the enzyme, catalysis by the \nenzyme generates a highly reactive group that forms a covalent bond and blocks the function of \nthe enzyme. Solution to Question 12: The red line in the graph represents an enzymatic reaction with a noncompetitive inhibitor. The above graph is called the 'Lineweaver-Burk plot' or 'double reciprocal' plot. 1/v0 (v0 - initial \nvelocity) is plotted versus 1/[S] ([S] - substrate concentration) and a straight line is obtained. This \nplot can be used to calculate Km and Vmax as well as to determine the mechanism of action of \nenzyme inhibitors. The x-intercept represents -1/Km while the y-intercept represents 1/Vmax. In non-competitive inhibition, Vmax decreases (or 1/Vmax increases) but Km is \nunchanged. Hence the graphs of inhibited and uninhibited reactions have the same x-intercepts \n(converge at the same -1/Km) but different y-intercepts. Note: An allosteric inhibitor alters the conformation of an enzyme upon binding. Enzymes \naffected by allosteric inhibitors exhibit a sigmoid, not hyperbolic, relationship between V0 and [S]. 311 \nSold by @itachibot Solution to Question 13: An allosteric modifier of an enzyme usually participates in feedback regulation. Allosteric regulations are a natural example of control loops, such as feedback from downstream \nproducts or feedforward from upstream substrates. Allosteric regulation is also particularly \nimportant in the cell's ability to adjust enzyme activity. An allosteric modifier or effector binds to the allosteric site to induce a conformational change in \nthe catalytic or active site. Those modifiers or effectors that enhance the protein's activity are \nreferred to as allosteric activators, whereas those that decrease the protein's activity are \ncalled allosteric inhibitors. Some examples of allosteric \nmodifiers Enzyme \nAllosteric inhibitor \nAllosteric activator 1. ALA synthase \nHeme \n- 2. Aspartate transcarbamoyla \nse CTP \nATP 3. HMG CoA reductase \nCholesterol \n- 4.Phosphofructokinase \nCitrate, ATP \nAMP, F2,6P 5. Acetyl CoA carboxylase \nAcyl CoA \nCitrate 6. Citrate synthase \nATP \n- - \nNAG 7. Carbamoyl phosphate synt \nhase-I 8. Carbamoyl phosphate synt \nhase-II ATP \n- 312 \nSold by @itachibot Solution to Question 14: Allosterically regulated enzymes belong to either the K-series, V-series or both. An allosteric modifier or effector binds to the allosteric site to induce a conformational change in \nthe catalytic or active site. The kinetics of allosteric effector dos not follow Michaelis-Menten \nkinetics. Hence, allosterically activated enzymes can fall under the following categories: • K-series: The allosteric effector raises the Km of the enzyme without affecting Vmax i.e. similar \nto competitive inhibition. • V-series: The allosteric effector lowers the Vmax without affecting Km i.e. similar to \nnon-competitive inhibition. • Both: Intermediate effects can also be seen. Option B: Allosteric modifier noncovalently binds to a site other than the active site (Allo=other, \nsteric=space) and affects the catalysis. Option C: Induction and repression are methods of controlling the rate of enzyme synthesis, not \nregulation of activity. Option D: Allosteric modifier binds to the enzymes noncovalently. Solution to Question 15: Chymotrypsinogen is a zymogen. Some enzymes are secreted as an inactive form called as zymogens. The zymogens are converted \nto their active functional forms by partial, or selective proteolysis. Examples of zymogens include \ntrypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, pepsinogen, prophospholipase A2 etc. 313 \nSold by @itachibot Solution to Question 16: Low dose aspirin exerts its action by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme activity in \nplatelets, which is an example of suicide inhibition. A suicidal enzyme is one that undergoes self-destruction in order to terminate its own activity. In \nthis case, in response to irreversible inhibition by aspirin, platelet cyclooxygenase loses its ability \nto synthesize thromboxane. It undergoes self-destruction. Unless new platelets are formed, this \ncyclooxygenase activity cannot be regained. Solution to Question 17: Both cytidine triphosphate and adenosine triphosphate target aspartate transcarbamoylase \n(ATCase) for feedback regulation. ATCase, the catalyst for the first reaction unique to pyrimidine biosynthesis, is a target of \nfeedback regulation by two nucleotide triphosphates: cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP). CTP is an end product of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. It inhibits \nATCase, whereas the purine nucleotide ATP activates it. High levels of ATP can overcome the inhibition by CTP, enabling synthesis of pyrimidine \nnucleotides to proceed even when purine nucleotide (CTP) levels are elevated. Solution to Question 18: Noncompetitive inhibition has constant Km and decreased Vmax. 314 \nSold by @itachibot Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds at a site different from the \nsubstrate-binding site. The structure of the inhibitor does not resemble that of the substrate and \nthe inhibitor does not affect the binding of the substrate. Solution to Question 19: Among the given graphs, the Gibbs free energy change of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is shown \nby graph A (Option B). Graph B (Option A) cannot represent the Gibbs free energy of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, as \nthe energy state of an intermediate cannot be lower than the product. A lower energy state of the \nintermediate implies that the enzyme-intermediate complex is stable and such a complex will \nusually not further form a product. During any chemical reaction, the product is formed by the breaking of substrate bonds and the \nconformational change of the substrate into a highly unstable transition state. This transition state \nis denoted by the peak of the graph. The Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction \n(with no intermediate state) is shown in the image given below: 315 \nSold by @itachibot The below graph shows the normal intermediate formation with an energy state still higher than \nthat of the product: All the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. Every \nintermediate state is again always followed by another transition state. Activation energy is the energy difference between the free energy of the substrates and that of the \ntransition state. Because of the high activation energy, the rates of uncatalyzed chemical reactions \nare often slow. 316 \nSold by @itachibot In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the activation energy is reduced by forming a relatively stable \nintermediate-enzyme complex. Enzymes provide attachment sites for the substrate and speed up \nthe rate of reaction. They don't change the energy state of either the substrate or the product. The \nGibbs free energy change remains the same. Graph C: Free energy change cannot be a straight line. Every reaction passes through a \nhigh-energy intermediate transition state. Graph D: The activation energy of any reaction is never lower than the free energy of the product. Solution to Question 20: The highest catalytic efficiency is seen when Km= 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec. Catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km, where Km is inversely proportional to the binding \naffinity of the enzyme and Kcat is the catalytic constant (Vmax divided by the total number of \nactive sites of the enzyme present). Higher values of Kcat and lower values of Km gives better \ncatalytic efficiency. Catalytic efficiency can be used to compare the performance of 2 different \nenzymes in catalyzing a reaction. Step 1: Km of each option after converting respective units to moles will be 10, 2, 2 and 4 (each \nmultiplied by 10-6) moles. Step 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km. On substituting the values in various \noptions after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 100 and 50 (each multiplied by \n106) M-1 s-1. Some enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They \nare limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These \nare called diffusion-limited enzymes and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 108 M-1 s-1. 317 \nSold by @itachibot Fat soluble vitamins Question 1: Basal metabolic rate is closely dependent on which of the following factors?",
