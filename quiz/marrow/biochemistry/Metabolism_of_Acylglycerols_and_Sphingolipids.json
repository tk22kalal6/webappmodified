      "explanation": "A preterm infant requiring resuscitation at birth with cyanosis and diffuse bilateral opacities on \nchest radiography is suggestive of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is caused by a deficiency \nof dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Dipalmitoyl lecithin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a major component of lung \nsurfactant. In DPPC, positions 1 &amp; 2 on the glycerol are occupied by palmitate. Surfactant is \nsecreted by the type 2 pneumocytes in the alveoli. It reduces surface tension at the air-liquid \ninterface of the alveolus and increases compliance. Mature levels of surfactant are present after 35 weeks of gestation. Thus, preterm babies are at \nrisk of surfactant deficiency, leading to infant respiratory distress syndrome. Lung maturity of the \nfetus can be assessed by determining the ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin (L:S ratio) in the \namniotic fluid. A ratio of &gt;2 indicates maturity.

      "explanation": "Chronic fatigue, growth retardation, epistaxis, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, \nErlenmeyer flask deformity of femur with bone marrow biopsy showing cells with wrinkled tissue \npaper appearance suggest Gaucher’s disease. Gaucher's disease is a genetic disorder in which glucocerebroside accumulates in the \nreticuloendothelial system due to the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (acid \n-glucosidase). It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder. Affected children present with bleeding tendencies secondary to thrombocytopenia, chronic \nfatigue secondary to anemia, painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and bone pain. They may \nhave liver cirrhosis, osteoporosis and pathological fractures. Neurological symptoms such as \ndevelopmental delay, hypertonia, strabismus, supranuclear gaze palsy are seen in type \n3 Gaucher's disease. On bone marrow biopsy, Gaucher's cells with wrinkled tissue paper \nappearance are seen. Erlenmeyer flask deformity is seen on X-ray of femur. 245 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment is with enzyme replacement therapy in the form of human recombinant acid \n-glucosidase (Imiglucerase), velaglucerase alfa or taliglucerase alfa. Note: Neurological involvement is not seen in type I Gaucher's disease",

      "explanation": "Metachromatic leucodystrophy occurs due to the deficiency of arylsulfatase A enzyme. Metachromatic leucodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder. Deficiency of arylsulfatase A \nenzyme leads to accumulation of sulfated glycosphingolipids in white matter with subsequent \ndemyelination. Affected infants (infantile form) present with cognitive deterioration, muscle \nweakness, hypotonia, nystagmus, myoclonic seizures, optic atrophy and progressive paralysis.",
