It is caused due to the \ncomplete deficiency of Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder.

Clinical features include compulsive self-mutilation, hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, delayed \nmilestones, dystonic movements and megaloblastic anemia.
