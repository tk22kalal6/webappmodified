      "explanation": "Mismatch repair will be defective in a patient with multiple gastrointestinal polyps and \ncarcinoma, with a positive family history/history of hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma \n(HNPCC) Mismatch repair is a DNA repair mechanism that corrects single-nucleotide mismatches, \ninsertions, and deletions introduced by the DNA polymerase during DNA replication. HNPCC or Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition. It occurs due to defects \nin DNA mismatch repair genes like MLH1 and MSH2. The genomes of these patients show \nmicrosatellite instability. HNPCC is associated with a high risk of colon cancer. It may also be \nassociated with a risk of developing carcinomas of the endometrium, stomach, small bowel, ovary, \npancreas, and transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter and renal pelvis. 400 \nSold by @itachibot The diagnostic criteria for HNPCC are referred to as the Amsterdam criteria or the 3-2-1-0 rule. It \nincludes: • Three or more relatives with HNPCC-associated cancer (colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, \ncancer of the small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis), one of whom is a first-degree relative of the \nother two. • At least two successive generations affected • At least one case diagnosed before age 50 years • Familial adenomatous polyposis excluded • Tumors verified by pathologic examination. Other options: Option B: Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the nucleotide excision repair \npathway. Option C: Defect in base excision repair pathway is seen in patients with MUTYH-associated \npolyposis. Option D: Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are examples of diseases seen in patients with \npoint mutations.",

In xeroderma pigmentosum, there is an inability to repair DNA pyrimidine dimers caused by UV \nexposure. It is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by exaggerated sunburns and \npigmentary changes on exposure to UV radiations.

      "explanation": "SCID is associated with a defective non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is a predominant pathway for DNA double-stranded break repair. NHEJ also functions in \nclass switch recombination, enhancing T and B cell diversity. Thus, NHEJ deficiency leads to \ncombined immunodeficiency due to a failure to carry out recombination efficiently. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterised by defects in both \nhumoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Genes involved are JAK3, RAG1, and IL-7R. \nPersons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of 401 \nSold by @itachibot pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pseudomonas species, \ncytomegalovirus, varicella, and a host of other bacteria. X- linked SCID is the most common form, accounting for 50% to 60% of cases, is X-linked, and \nhence, SCID is more common in boys. The genetic defect is a mutation in the common -chain (c) \nsubunit of cytokine receptors. In these patients, the thymus contains lobules of undifferentiated \nepithelial cells, resembling fetal thymus. Autosomal recessive SCID is commonly caused by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) \nenzyme. In these patients, the thymus contains remnants of Hassall’s corpuscles.",

The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are clustered \npalindromic sequences found in many bacteria. It is a form of acquired immunity to infection by \nbacteriophages which complements the system of restriction endonucleases and methylases. \nCRISPR uses RNA-based targeting to bring the Cas9 endonuclease to foreign (or any \ncomplementary) DNA.

      "explanation": "The false statement is that telomerase is involved in DNA repair. Telomeres are the end of chromosomal DNA. Since prokaryotic DNA is circular, it does not have \nfree ends and hence no telomeres. Thus, telomeres are present only in eukaryotes Telomeres have \nTG- rich repeats and usually do not code for any proteins. With every DNA replication during cell \ndivision, telomere shortening occurs. Once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in \nlength, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of \ntimes a cell can divide. In stem cells and cancer cells, an enzyme telomerase having reverse transcriptase activity (RNA \ndependent DNA polymerase) adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby preserving \nchromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more number of \ntimes than a normal adult cell. 403 \nSold by @itachibot RNA synthesis, processing and modification",
