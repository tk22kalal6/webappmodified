      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Collagen comes under glycoprotein sub-classes of O-glycosidic linkages. Glycoproteins can be divided into three main groups: • O-linked: They contain an O-glycosidic linkage. Examples include mucin, proteoglycans, \ncollagens, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. • N-linked: They contain an N-glycosidic linkage. The types of N-glycosidic linkage include \ncomplex, hybrid and high-mannose types. 172 \nSold by @itachibot • Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored): Examples include acetylcholinesterase, \nalkaline phosphatase, decay-accelerating factor, 5-Nucleotidase, thy-1 antigen and variable \nsurface glycoprotein (Trypanosoma brucei).",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Type III collagen is involved in wound healing. Collagen types I and III predominate in the skin and aponeurotic layers. In the early stages of \nwound healing, type III collagen is synthesized. It is replaced by type I collagen as wound healing \nprogresses. The tensile strength of the healing wound is directly proportional to the amount and type of \ncollagen present. During healing, as disorganized collagen is degraded and reformed, covalent \ncross-links are formed that enhance tensile strength. The maximum strength of the healed wound \ndepends upon the interconnection of collagen subunits. Approximately 80 percent of the original \nstrength of the tissue is obtained by six weeks after surgery. Wounds slowly continue to get \nstronger but may never achieve 100 percent of their previous strength.",

      "explanation": "Lack of a specific lysosomal hydrolase for glycoproteins cause a group of very rare, autosomal \nrecessive genetic diseases called glycoprotein storage diseases (oligosaccharidoses). Lysosomal acid hydrolases are specific for the removal of the oligosaccharide chains of \nglycoproteins. They are primarily exoenzymes that remove their respective groups in sequence in \nthe reverse order of their incorporation (“last on, first off”). When one acid hydrolase is deficient, \nthere is accumulation of partially degraded glycoproteins in the lysosomes. This results in \noligosaccharidoses.",

      "explanation": "Buphthalmos is not a feature of I-cell disease. I- cell disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defect in the Golgi enzyme \nN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This results in failure of the Golgi to phosphorylate \nmannose residues (mannose-6-phosphate) on glycoproteins. Hence, proteins are secreted \nextracellularly instead of being delivered to lysosomes. Lysosomes lack most normal enzymes and \nthus accumulate undegraded molecules, forming inclusion bodies. It is characterized by the following: • Coarse facial features • Gingival hyperplasia • Clouded corneas • Restricted joint movements • Claw hand deformities • Kyphoscoliosis • High plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes",
