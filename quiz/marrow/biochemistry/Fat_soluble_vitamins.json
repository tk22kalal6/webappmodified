      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is closely dependent on lean body mass (fat-free mass). Lean body mass is the difference between total body weight and body fat weight. It is the \nmetabolically active tissue in the body. The BMR decreases with increasing age, even when body weight remains constant. This is the \nresult of muscle tissue replacement by adipose tissue, which is metabolically less active. Women \nhave a significantly lower BMR than men of the same body weight and age. This is because \nwomen’s bodies contain proportionally more adipose tissue.",

Estimated average requirement (EAR): The EAR is the average daily nutrient intake level \nestimated to meet the requirement of one-half of healthy individuals in a particular life stage and \ngender group. Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): The RDA is the average daily dietary intake level that is \nsufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all individuals in a life stage and gender \ngroup.

      "explanation": "This patient with difficult dark vision and gritty sensations in the eye with findings of soft corneas \nsuggests vitamin A deficiency. In the retina, a form of vitamin A called retinal (11-cis \nretinaldehyde) plays an important role in Wald's visual cycle. Its deficiency leads to vision defects. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, consists of 11-cis retinal specifically \nbound to the protein opsin. When rhodopsin is exposed to light, a series of photochemical \nisomerizations occurs. This results in the bleaching of the visual pigment and release of \nall-trans-retinal and opsin. This process triggers a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic \nnerve to the brain. The image given below shows Wald's visual cycle. 324 \nSold by @itachibot",

Vitamin D, as either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol does not have significant biological activity. It \nis activated in the following steps: • Skin: 7-Dehydrocholesterol (an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol in the skin) \nundergoes a nonenzymic reaction on exposure to ultraviolet light (290nm to 315nm), \nyielding cholecalciferol. • Liver: Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (the most abundant \ncirculatory form of Vitamin D) by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. • Kidney: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the \nbiologically active form by the enzyme 1-hydroxylase. Calcitriol acts on the bone, intestine, and kidney to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis. \nIf the body does not require vitamin D, in the kidney, 24-hydroxylase converts vitamin D into \n24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is an inactive metabolite.",
