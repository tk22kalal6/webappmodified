      "explanation": "D-mannose and L-mannose are enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other. The designation of a sugar isomer as the D- or L- form is determined by its spatial relationship to \nthe parent compound of the carbohydrates, that is, the three-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde. The \norientation of the —H and —OH groups around the penultimate carbon atom determines whether \nthe sugar belongs to the D- or L- series. When the —OH group on the penultimate carbon atom of \nthe sugar is on the right side, then the sugar is designated as a D- isomer. When the –OH group is \non the left, it is an L-isomer. Naturally occurring monosaccharides are D-sugars and naturally occurring amino \nacids are L-isomers. Racemase enzyme interconverts between D and L isomers. Examples of enantiomers include D-glucose and L-glucose, D-fructose and L-fructose and \nD-mannose and L-mannose 11 \nSold by @itachibot",

The liver function is \nmeasured as the rate of excretion of galactose in urine following the \ningestion or intravenous injection of a known amount of galactose. \nNormally, less than 3 g appear in the urine within 5 hours after the ingestion of 40 g of galactose.",

      "explanation": "Naglazyme is used in the treatment of Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome. Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome/MPS VI is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B enzyme whose \ngene locus is on chromosome 5. Preservation of intelligence is the feature of this syndrome. It is \ncharacterized by macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, macroglossia, short stature, and contractures. Naglazyme is used as an enzyme replacement therapy.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a child with easy fatiguability, irritability, and inability to \nconcentrate with the images showing a crumpled tissue paper appearance(Gaucher's cell) is \nsuggestive of Gaucher's disease. The deficient enzyme is glucocerebrosidase (also known as \nbeta-glucosidase). I Gaucher's disease is an inborn error of metabolism caused due to a deficiency of beta \nglucocerebrosidase. It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder and the mode of \ninheritance is autosomal recessive. There is an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the \nspleen, liver, and other tissues. There are three clinical subtypes - type I (chronic non-neuronopathic), type II (acute \nneuronopathic), and type III (intermediate). Clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nhepatosplenomegaly, and neurological features depending on the subtype. Gaucher's cells - These are formed as a result of the accumulation of massive amounts of \nglucocerebrosides within the phagocytes. The cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm and give a crumpled \ntissue paper appearance. 19 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A is seen in Tay-Sachs disease. The deficiency of \nbeta-hexosaminidase A and B causes Sandhoff's disease. Clinical features are seizures, \nmacrocephaly, and hyperacusis. Option C: Deficiency of sphingomyelinase leads to Niemann-Pick disease. It is characterized by \nthe presence of foam cells in the bone marrow. There may be pulmonary infiltrates leading to lung \nfailure. Option D: Deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminidase leads to Sanfillipo's disease. It is a type of \nmucopolysaccharidosis (MPS - III). There is an accumulation of heparan sulfate leading to severe \ncognitive degeneration. 20 \nSold by @itachibot Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis",
