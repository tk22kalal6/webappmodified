      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Cholesterol synthesis takes place in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which condenses with another acetyl-CoA to form \nHMG-CoA. Cytosolic HMG-CoA, a key intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis, is reduced in the endoplasmic \nreticulum to mevalonic acid by the regulatory enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonic acid \nsubsequently undergoes phosphorylation, decarboxylation , condensation and cyclicization \nreactions to produce cholesterol. Summary of cholesterol synthesis pathway: • Synthesis of mevalonate from acetyl-CoA • Formation of isoprenoid units from mevalonate • Condensation of six isoprenoid units form squalene • Cyclization of squalene to give rise to the parent steroid, lanosterol • Formation of cholesterol from lanosterol. All tissues containing nucleated cells are capable of cholesterol synthesis, with the majority \nproduced in the liver and intestine. 253 \nSold by @itachibot",

They are next conjugated with glycine and taurine in the liver peroxisomes to form \nglycocholic, glycochenodeoxycholic, taurocholic, and taurochenodeoxycholic acids. The secondary bile acids are formed in the intestine as the primary bile acids are deconjugated \nand dehydroxylated by the intestinal bacteria to form deoxycholic and lithocholic acid.

It is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis \nof bile acids. Regulation of bile acid synthesis occurs by feedback inhibition of 7-hydroxylase via the \nFarnesoid X receptor.

Insulin induces the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which is present on the capillary walls.
