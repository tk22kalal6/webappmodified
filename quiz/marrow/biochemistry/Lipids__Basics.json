      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Steroids are derived lipids. Lipids are classified as follows: • Simple lipids: Esters of fatty acids with various alcohols. E.g. fats, oils, and waxes. • Complex lipids: Esters of fatty acids with alcohols containing other groups like phosphate, \nnitrogenous base, carbohydrate, protein, etc. They can be divided into three groups: • Phospholipids: Contain fatty acids, alcohol, phosphoric acid and a nitrogenous base. • Glycolipids (glycosphingolipids): Contain fatty acids, sphingosine, and carbohydrate • Others: Sulfolipids, amino lipids, and lipoproteins • Derived lipids: These are the formed by the hydrolysis of simple and complex lipids. They \npossess the characteristics of lipids. Examples: Fatty acids, glycerol, steroids/sterols, lipid-soluble \nvitamins, ketone bodies etc.",

Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain a single double bond. Examples include palmitoleic \nacid (7), oleic acid (9) and elaidic acid (9). Clinical correlate: When substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet, MUFAs lower both total \nand LDL cholesterol and increase HDL. This may explain why the Mediterranean diet is \nassociated with decreased serum total and LDL cholesterol compared to a typical Western diet \nhigh in saturated fats.",

      "explanation": "Omega 3 (3) fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. 3 fatty acids, such as linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, result in synthesis \nof less inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This contributes to their anti-inflammatory \neffect. They also have anti-thrombotic effects. This is because thromboxane A3 (formed from 3 \nfatty acids) is less thrombogenic than thromboxane A2 (formed from 6 fatty acids). 3 fatty \nacids have also been shown to reduce serum triglyceride levels.",

Essential fatty acids refer to polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) required for biological processes \nwhich are not synthesized by the body. Thus, they must be acquired from diet.

Linoleic acid is an essential fatty \nacid. 192 \nSold by @itachibot Essential fatty acids (Linoleic acid and -Linolenic acid) are needed for many physiologic \nprocesses, including maintaining the integrity of skin and cell membranes. Deficiency of essential \nfatty acid is a rarely seen clinical entity in healthy adults and children who consume a varied diet. \nHowever, it can occur in individuals with risk factors affecting fatty acid absorption, like cystic \nfibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, massive bowel resection and \nprolonged parenteral nutrition.

      "explanation": "Trans fatty acids are a by-product of the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. Trans fatty acids are isomers of cis fatty acids, the naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids. The \nconfiguration of groups in a trans fatty acid is such that the acyl chains are on the opposite side of \nthe double bond. They are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and in the \nproduction of margarine. Trans fatty acids raise the level of triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol and also lower the level \nof HDL. Hence their consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. \nWHO recommends that the intake of trans fats should be less than 1% of the total energy intake.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A young boy with muscle aches, hypotonia, poor exercise tolerance, myoglobinuria and elevated \ncreatine kinase suggests a deficiency of carnitine. Carnitine is a key transporter needed for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. It binds to acyl-CoAs to \nform acylcarnitine. This helps in the transfer of fatty acids across the impermeable inner \nmitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. Thus, carnitine deficiency results in impaired \nbeta-oxidation of fatty acids. There will be inadequate ATP production in response to increased \ndemands (e.g. exercise) with excess fatty acid accumulation in muscle cells. This results in muscle \nbreakdown. Patients with carnitine deficiency present with hypoglycemia, muscle aches, hypotonia and poor \nexercise tolerance (myopathy). They have high levels of serum creatine kinase. Treatment includes \ncarnitine supplementation.",
