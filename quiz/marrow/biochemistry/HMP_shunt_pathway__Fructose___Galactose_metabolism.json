      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The non-oxidative phase of the HMP pathway is reversible. In the HMP shunt, no ATP is formed, but the formation of NADPH and ribose takes place. The \npentose phosphate pathway is an alternative route for the metabolism of glucose. It does not lead to the formation of ATP, but it has two major functions: • Main source of NADPH: important for reductive biosynthesis of fatty acids and steroids, and \nmaintaining reduced glutathione for antioxidant activity 63 \nSold by @itachibot • Synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate There are ç phases in the HMP pathway: • Oxidative: irreversible • Non-oxidative: reversible",

The clinical features are suggestive of an acute hemolytic reaction following the administration of \ncotrimoxazole. A hemolytic attack starts with abrupt onset of malaise, weakness, and abdominal \nor lumbar pain.

In G‹PD \ndeficiency uncontrolled oxidative stress causes hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies. \nBite cells result from the removal of Heinz bodies by macrophages in the spleen.

Glucuronic acid, pentose sugars, proteoglycans are all the products obtained in the uronic acid \npathway in humans. In the liver, the uronic acid pathway is the source of glucuronic acid for conjugation of many \nendogenous and exogenous substances before excretion as glucuronides in urine and bile. The lack of one enzyme of the uronic acid pathway called L-gulonolactone oxidase in primates and \nsome other animals including human beings explains why ascorbic acid (vitamin C) cannot be \nendogenously synthesized.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "High levels of L-xylulose in urine point to a diagnosis of essential pentosuria. It is a benign \ncondition caused due to a defect in the uronic acid pathway. Essential pentosuria has no clinical consequences. However, it can give false-positive results when \nurinary glucose is measured using alkaline copper reagents (Benedict’s test). The lack of enzyme xylulose reductase of the uronic acid pathway leads to essential Pentosuria. \nAffected individuals excrete large amounts of L-xylulose in urine. Xylulose being a reducing sugar \ngives Benedict's test positive. Bial's test is positive as xylulose is a pentose.

      "explanation": "Fructokinase is the first enzyme to act on fructose metabolism. Fructokinase in the liver, kidneys and intestine catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose to \nfructose-‘-phosphate. This enzyme does not act on glucose and, unlike glucokinase, its activity is \nnot affected by fasting or by insulin, which may explain why fructose is cleared from the blood of \ndiabetic patients at a normal rate.
