      "explanation": "A straight-chain fatty acid comprising of 2N carbon atoms will undergo [(2N ÷ 2) -1] = (N-1) cycles \nof beta-oxidation and produce N number of acetyl CoA. Each acetyl CoA will undergo TCA cycle, producing 10 ATP. On the other hand, each cycle of \nbeta-oxidation also produces 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH generating 1.5 ATP and 2.5 ATP respectively. \nTherefore (N-1) cycles of beta-oxidation will produce (N-1) FADH2 and (N-1) NADH. The energetics of -oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid comprising of 2N carbon atoms can be \nsummarized as follows: So, the net ATP yield after beta-oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid having 2N carbon atoms \nwill be (14N-4) - 2 = (14N- 6)We must keep in mind that during the initial activation of fatty acids \n(conversion of fatty acid to fatty acyl CoA), 2 ATP is utilized.

Defects in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase have been identified as a cause of sudden \ninfant death syndrome (SIDS).

      "options": {
        "a": "Glycogenesis in muscle",
        "b": "Increased protein synthesis",
        "c": "Increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA",
        "d": "Decreased cholesterol synthesis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "With the background of inadequately treated type I diabetes mellitus, an insulin-deficient state in \nthe body is expected which will lead to increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is commonly found in the adolescent population. In response to certain \nprecipitating factors, such patients may develop a severe insulin-deficient state. Since insulin is an \ninhibitor of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an insulin-deficient state will cause HSL overactivity \nin adipocytes and the breakdown of lipid into fatty acids (lipolysis). Free fatty acids will undergo \nbeta-oxidation and produce a large amount of acetyl CoA, which gets converted to ketone bodies ( \nacetoacetate, acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, etc.)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "2, 3 and 4 statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type1 \nDM. Type 1 DM is characterized by a deficiency in insulin production. Since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 \n(insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal \nmuscles. So adipose tissue mobilizes fat to be used as an energy source. These FFA (free fatty \nacids) are oxidized to acetoacetyl CoA which serves as a precursor for ketone body synthesis. As the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately more of the acetyl-CoA produced from their \nbreakdown is converted to ketone bodies and less is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to CO2. A fall \nin the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability \nof the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. \nSuch a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased \n-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of \noxaloacetate is decreased. Beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis. \nIncreased rate of ketone body synthesis in insulin-deficient state implies an increased activity of \nbeta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase enzyme. 210 \nSold by @itachibot Biosynthesis of fatty acids and Eicosanoids",
