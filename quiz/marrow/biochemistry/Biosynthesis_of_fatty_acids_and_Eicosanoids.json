      "explanation": "The reducing equivalent for fatty acid synthesis in the liver is NADPH. The most important source \nof NADPH is the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) pathway. The HMP shunt pathway, or pentose phosphate pathway, is an alternative route for the \nmetabolism of glucose. It generates NADPH and synthesizes ribose. NADP+ is hydrogenated to \nNADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Since the HMP shunt pathway and de novo fatty \nacid synthesis both occur in the cytosol of the cell, there are no membranes or permeability \nbarriers against the transfer of NADPH. Thus, this forms the major source for NADPH for fatty \nacid synthesis. Other minor sources of NADPH are extramitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADP \nmalate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme).",

      "explanation": "220 \nSold by @itachibot The restoration of fat storage in a child undergoing nutritional rehabilitation, as evidenced by \nadequate weight gain and an increase in subcutaneous body fat, occurs with the help of acetyl CoA \ncarboxylase. With appropriate supplementation of nutrition, the child's body will gradually enter an anabolic \nphase. In the well fed state, there is an abundant supply of glucose, which is converted to \npyruvate, which in turn is converted to acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is diverted into fatty acid synthesis, \nin which acetyl CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme. There is also a high insulin : glucagon \nratio in the well fed state. This favors dephosphorylation (activation) of acetyl CoA carboxylase, \nresulting in increased fatty acid synthesis. The fatty acids thus formed (most commonly palmitoyl \nCoA) are esterified into triacylglycerols. This process is called lipogenesis. Note: The enzymes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, thiolase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I are \ninvolved in fatty acid oxidation and are inactive in the well-fed state.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Malonyl-CoA is the most active donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA is a 3-carbon unit that donates 2 carbon units in fatty acid synthesis. It is formed \nfrom acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. During fatty acid synthesis, acetyl CoA primarily acts \nas the primer. The enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to the \ninital acetyl-CoA, forming a 4-carbon intermediate (butyryl-ACP). FAS then sequentially adds two \ncarbons from malonyl-CoA to the ACP-intermediates (eg: butyryl-ACP) to elongate the fatty acid \nchain. Thus, in the end product palmitic acid (C16), only carbon atoms 15 and 16 are from acetyl CoA. \nThe remaining 14 carbon atoms are derived from malonyl-CoA. Thus, malonyl-CoA is the most \nactive donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis. Note: Option 3: Fatty acid synthesis is not a simple reversal of oxidation of fatty acids. These two \nprocesses involve completely different enzymes and occur in different compartments of the cell. Option 4: Intermediates in fatty acid synthesis are covalently linked to the sulfhydryl group of \nan acyl carrier protein (ACP), not coenzyme A, of the enzyme fatty acid synthase. Intermediates in \nthe fatty acid breakdown are covalently attached to the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Glycerol + phosphate + choline or ethanolamine",
        "b": "Monoglyceride + phosphate + choline or ethanolamine",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) is the first intermediate product produced in the LOX \npathway. 5-lipoxygenase, the first enzyme of the LOX pathway, breaks down arachidonic acid into \n5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) which undergoes further chemical reactions to \nproduce leukotrienes (LTs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and lipoxins. 227 \nSold by @itachibot 228 \nSold by @itachibot Metabolism of Acylglycerols and Sphingolipids",
