Tryptophan deficiency is not a feature of this \ndisorder. The deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase causes PKU. Characteristic clinical findings in Phenylketonuria: • Mental retardation • Failure to walk or talk • Seizures • Hyperactivity • Tremor • Microcephaly • Failure to grow • Deficiency of pigmentation (fair hair, light skin color, and blue eyes) The Guthrie bacterial inhibition test is a screening test for phenylketonuria. This test uses a \nphenylalanine requiring strain of Bacillus subtilis. The ferric chloride test is also used as a \nscreening test for PKU.

The initial reactions in arginine catabolism are the conversion of arginine to ornithine followed by \nthe transamination of ornithine.

It presents \nwith myopia and night blindness in adolescence which progresses to legal blindness by 50 years. \nThe condition is treated with dietary restriction of arginine. 150 \nSold by @itachibot",

Fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria) is an autosomal recessive disease where \nTMA(trimethylamine) is not converted to the non-odorous TMAO (TMA-N-oxide) in the liver. This \nis due to the deficiency of flavin-containing mono oxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMA then builds up in the \nbody and is released in sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong odor of rotting fish from the \nbody. Choline, lecithin, and TMAO are precursors of trimethylamine which are found in food products. \nThese food products are eggs, liver, peanuts, meat, poultry, fish, dairy foods, pasta, and rice.",

In Wilson's disease \nthe amount of conjugated amino acids far exceeds the amount of free amino acids. Methyl \nHistidine largely exists in free form and does not increase in amount on hydrolysis of acids in \nurine. Hence low amounts is seen in Wilson's disease. Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene located \non chromosome 13. The ATP7B gene, encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, \nexpressed on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. Deficiency in the ATP7B protein causes a decrease in copper excretion into the bile, impairs its \nincorporation into ceruloplasmin, and inhibits ceruloplasmin secretion into the blood, leading to \nthe accumulation of toxic levels of copper in the liver, brain, and eye.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Urine turning black on exposure to air is suggestive of alkaptonuria which occurs due to the defect \nin homogentisate oxidase enzyme. Alkaptonuria is a disorder of tyrosine metabolism, that develops due to the defect in \nhomogentisate oxidase, which oxidizes homogentisate to maleylacetoacetate. The defect in this \nenzyme leads to the accumulation of homogentisate, which is then excreted in the urine. The \nexcreted homogentisate gets oxidized when exposed to the air and causes the urine to turn black. In some cases, the excessive homogentisate may get oxidized to benzoquinone acetate, which \nbinds to the connective tissue. This leads to arthritis and pigmentation of the connective tissue, a \ncondition called ochronosis. Other options: Option B: Xanthine oxidase deficiency results in hypouricemia, xanthinuria, and xanthine \nlithiasis. Option C: Defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase can lead to phenylketonuria characterised by \nhyperreflexia, seizures, hypopigmentation, low IQ, hyperactivity, and tremors. Option D: Defects in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are rarely seen in clinical practice. Miller \nsyndrome is associated with this defect. 152 \nSold by @itachibot Protein structure and function",
