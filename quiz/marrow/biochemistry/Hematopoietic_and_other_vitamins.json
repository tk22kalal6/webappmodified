      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Vitamin B12 contains corrin rings with cobalt as a part of its structure, hence this group of \nvitamins are referred to as cobalamins. Vitamin B12 is derived mainly from animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and fortified \ncereals. There are no plant sources as such for vitamin B12 / cobalamine, hence strict \nvegetarians are at risk of developing a nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with defects in RBC production leading to megaloblastic \nanemia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A 30-year-old patient who got his ileum removed due to Crohn's disease is likely to develop \nvitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum via receptors \nknown as cubulin, which binds the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex. Dietary vitamin B12 is normally bound to proteins in food. Pepsin and gastric acid in the stomach \ndegrade these food proteins and release vitamin B12. The free vitamin B12 then binds to a salivary \nglycoprotein called haptocorrin (R-binder). In the alkaline pH of the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade the haptocorrin, and vitamin \nB12 is released again. It then binds tightly to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the \nparietal cells of the stomach and this binding takes place in the duodenum. The IF-Vitamin B12 \ncomplex reaches the terminal ileum and attaches to a receptor on the enterocyte, from where it is \nabsorbed. Vitamin B12 is transported in the blood bound to a carrier protein called \ntranscobalamin II and delivered to the peripheral tissues.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The above scenario suggests anemia and methylmalonic acid excretion in the urine can be utilized \nto assess the nutritional status of vitamin B12. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme. The activity of methylmalonyl \nCoA mutase is greatly reduced in vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to an accumulation of \nmethylmalonic acid and its excretion in urine. There are two vitamin B12-dependent enzymes: • Methionine synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase): Catalyzes the conversion of \nhomocysteine to methionine • Methylmalonyl CoA mutase: methylmalonyl CoA, formed as an intermediate in the catabolism of \nvaline, isoleucine, and propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl CoA Note: Urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid is also used to differentiate between megaloblastic \nanemia due to folate and vitamin B12 deficiency.",

      "explanation": "Folate trap occurs in the deficiency of vitamin B12. 351 \nSold by @itachibot The conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF(methyltetrahydrofolate) is an \nirreversible process. The major source of tetrahydrofolate for tissues is 5-methyl-THF. The only \nway to make further use of 5-methyl-THF and to maintain the folate cycle is by the vitamin \nB12-dependent remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase enzyme. Decreased activity of methionine synthase in vitamin B12 deficiency results in the accumulation of \nmethyltetrahydrofolate that cannot be used, resulting in a folate trap. The folate cycle provides a \nlink between the functions of folate and vitamin B12, where vitamin B12 deficiency causes a \nfunctional deficiency of folate.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of a patient on a vegan diet now presenting with glossitis of the tongue, \nhyperreflexia, and numbness and tingling in the legs is suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. \nDecreased homocysteine levels are not seen in this condition. Rather, increased homocysteine \nlevels are seen. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor of methionine synthase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Methionine \nsynthase is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is the principal \nmethyl donor. In vitamin B12 deficiency, defective methionine synthase leads to the following: 1. In the absence of methionine, there is decreased methylation in the CNS. This leads to defective \nsynthesis of myelin and neurotransmitters, which results in the following symptoms : • Posterolateral cord degeneration: It presents as loss of proprioception and vibration, positive \nRomberg sign, ataxia, hyperreflexia, spasticity • Dementia leading to cognitive impairment • Peripheral neuropathy: presenting as muscle weakness, paraesthesia • Optic atrophy 2. Homocysteine accumulates in the blood conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 352 \nSold by @itachibot 3. Megaloblastic anemia: The availability of 5,10-methylene THF is reduced, which is required in \nthe conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine monophosphate (TMP) for \nDNA synthesis. This leads to macrocytic anemia with megaloblasts in the bone marrow.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The most likely cause is folate therapy which used up the B12 stores, aggravating the symptoms. Administration of folic acid for patients with macrocytic anemia can partially reverse the \nhematologic abnormalities associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, the neurologic \nmanifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency are not treated by folic acid. Administration of folic acid to an individual with vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially mask \nuntreated vitamin B12 deficiency or even worsen the neurologic complications. Hence, testing for \nand/or treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency is required in all patients being treated with folic acid. 354 \nSold by @itachibot",
