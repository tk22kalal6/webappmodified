      "explanation": "Glutathione is not a reactive oxygen species (ROS). Glutathione is an antioxidant. Reduced glutathione is used for detoxification of hydrogen \nperoxide. Bridges–Good syndrome is a chronic granulomatous disease due to a deficiency of NADPH \noxidase. In this syndrome, the lysosomes are unable to produce hydrogen peroxide to kill the \nbacteria. Such patients have increased susceptibility towards catalase-positive organisms. Note: • The most powerful oxygen-free radical is hydroxyl radical (OH-) • The least powerful reactive oxygen species is hydrogen peroxide • The precursor of all reactive oxygen species is superoxide radical (O2–)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Direct assay of free radicals is not used for the measurement of total body free radical burden. This is because free radicals are extremely reactive and short-lived. Free radical activity is usually \nassessed by indirect methods. Thus, the total body free radical burden can be estimated by \nmeasuring the products of lipid peroxidation using the following methods: • FOX (Ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange) assay 362 \nSold by @itachibot • Estimation of dialdehydes: The dialdehydes formed from lipid peroxides can be measured by \nreaction with thiobarbituric acid. • Measurement of pentane and methane in exhaled air Note: Radical damage to unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins leads \nto the formation of lipid peroxides.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant. Antioxidants are used to control and reduce lipid peroxidation during which reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) are formed. Antioxidants thus fall into two classes: • Preventive: These reduce the rate of chain initiation of lipid peroxidation. • Chain-breaking: These interfere with the chain propagation phase of lipid peroxidation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Lipid-engorged macrophages are killed by unesterified cholesterol. Free radicals can damage the proteins and lipids in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL). They \nare chemically modified to form abnormal LDL which are not recognized by the liver LDL \nreceptors. Thus, abnormal LDL is not cleared by the liver and is instead taken up by macrophage \nscavenger receptors. These lipid-engorged macrophages infiltrate the blood vessel \nendothelium. These macrophages are then killed by the high content of unesterified cholesterol \nthey have accumulated. This causes the development of atherosclerotic plaques which, over time, \ncan completely occlude a blood vessel.",

        "d": "Myeloperoxidase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The enzyme responsible for the respiratory burst in neutrophils is NADPH oxidase, which is \ndeficient in this child. NADPH oxidase is an enzyme in the inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and \nmacrophages) which produces superoxide anion by reducing oxygen. It does so by a process of \nrespiratory burst during phagocytosis. Most of the enzymes that produce and require superoxide \nare contained in the peroxisomes, together with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases. NADPH + 2O2   NADP+ + 2·O2 + 2H+ NADPH deficiency can lead to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is characterised by an \ninability of neutrophils and monocytes to kill catalase-positive organisms. Children present with \nrecurrent ear, lung or bone infections. Note: 363 \nSold by @itachibot There are multiple sources of oxygen radicals in the body: • Ionizing radiation (x-rays and UV) causes lysis of water, leading to the formation of hydroxyl \nradicals • Transition metal ions (Cu+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+) can react nonenzymatically with oxygen or \nhydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals • Nitric oxide can react with superoxide to yield peroxynitrite, which decays to form hydroxyl \nradicals • NADPH oxidase in the inflammatory cells produces superoxide",

Vitamin E is considered as a first-line pharmacological \ntreatment option for NASH in non-diabetics when diet and lifestyle changes have failed. Vitamin E is well tolerated and shows modest improvements in aminotransferase levels, \nradiographic features of hepatic steatosis, and/or histologic features of NASH. It is important to \nnote that vitamin E must be considered only for non-diabetic patients due to cardiovascular risks \nwith chronic vitamin E therapy.

He is confused and has a slurred speech. His blood ethanol levels \nare 220 mg/dl and his glucose levels are 45 mg/dL. The toxic effects of the substance \nconsumed by this patient are due to which of the following?",

        "d": "Stimulation of fatty acid oxidation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Confusion and slurred speech with elevated blood ethanol levels suggests ethanol \nintoxication. The toxicity of ethanol is due to the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. Ethanol is metabolised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase. This reaction generates NADH. A \nhigh concentration of NADH leads to a high NADH/NAD+ ratio. Due to this, the metabolic \nreactions which require NAD+ are inhibited. This is the basic cause of all the metabolic effects of \nalcohol. Glycolysis, citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation are inhibited. Ketogenesis is favoured. \nPyruvate is shunted for lactate synthesis due to abundance of NADHand lactate/pyruvate ratio \nincreases. Thus gluconeogenesis, which requires pyruvate as a substratre, is inhibited. This leads 364 \nSold by @itachibot to hypoglycemia.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In a patient with Menke's disease, glutathione peroxidase action is not affected. 365 \nSold by @itachibot Menke’s disease, or kinky/steely hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition, where there is a \nmutation in the ATP7A gene. This leads to defective copper-binding P-type ATPase and copper is \nnot mobilized from the intestine. Thus copper deficiency occurs and enzymes containing copper \nare affected, like superoxide dismutase, dopamine hydroxylase and amine oxidase. Glutathione peroxidase is not affected since it requires selenium in the form of selenocysteine. Other copper deficiency disorders include Wilson's disease and MEDNIK syndrome. Wilson’s \ndisease is an autosomal recessive disorder, due to ATP7B mutation, a gene encoding for copper \ntransporting ATPase in the cells. There is defective biliary copper excretion from liver cells, \nleading to copper deposits in the liver and brain. MEDNIK syndrome is a rare multisystem \ndisorder of copper metabolism with features of both Wilson’s and Menke’s disease. Note: Other enzymes requiring copper are ferroxidase (ceruloplasmin) , cytochrome c oxidase, \ntyrosinase (melanin synthesis), lysyl oxidase (cross-linking in collagen).
