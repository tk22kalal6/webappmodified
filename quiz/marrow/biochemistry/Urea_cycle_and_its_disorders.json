      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "This child with vomiting, lethargy, and irritability with an X-linked recessive urea cycle disorder \nmost likely hyperammonemia type II Hyperammonemia type II is due to the deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase. It \nis the most frequent urea cycle defect. Biochemical findings include elevated levels of glutamine in \nthe blood, urine, CSF, low citrulline, and high urinary orotic acid. This condition may be \nprecipitated by a switch from formula to whole milk. Urea cycle disorders are all characterized by hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory \nalkalosis. There is an accumulation of the precursors of urea - ammonia, and glutamine. They \ninclude: • Defect in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I - Hyperammonemia type 1 • Defect in ornithine transcarbamoylase - Hyperammonemia type 2 • Defect in argininosuccinate synthetase - Citrullinemia • Defect in argininosuccinate lyase- Argininosuccinic aciduria • Defect in the gene for arginase- Hyperargininemia Clinical features of urea cycle disorders are common to all and include vomiting, avoidance of \nhigh-protein foods, intermittent ataxia, irritability, lethargy, and severe mental retardation. Note: Classically, Type 2 Hyperammonemia is an X- linked recessive disorder. But in certain \nheterozygous females (with one mutated gene), the disease manifests and they necessarily do not \nremain as carriers. In them, the disease follows an X-linked partially dominant pattern of \ninheritance.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This infant with failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, elevated levels of glutamine and uracil levels most \nlikely has hyperammonemia type 2. This condition occurs due to the deficiency of the enzyme \nornithine transcarbamoylase. There is an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which then enters into pyrimidine \nsynthesis producing orotic acid and uracil and leading to orotic aciduria and high uracil in blood \nand urine. Since the ammonia from glutamine is not converted into urea, its level increases. \nGlutamate is not regenerated. Since glutamate is not available for transamination, amino acids 182 \nSold by @itachibot cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. Hence, the glucose level drops in the blood. Treatment: • Reducing intake of ammonia - Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restricted \nand caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. • Increasing excretion of ammonia - Addition of phenylbutyrate, which scavenges nitrogen by \ncombining with amino acids to form a more water-soluble product. This can be easily excreted by \nthe kidneys.",
