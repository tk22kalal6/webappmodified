      "explanation": "The gene expressing beta-galactosidase is not a housekeeping gene. Housekeeping or constitutive genes are those which are expressed at a constant rate in almost all \nthe cells of the body. These genes are required for the basal cellular function. Examples \ninclude genes encoding RNA polymerase, ribosomal protein, rRNA, enzymes for glycolysis, etc. In contrast, inducible genes are those which are expressed under special circumstances. The \nexpression of these genes increase in response to an activator or inducer, or decrease in response \nto a repressor.",

      "explanation": "A repressor protein is produced by a regulatory gene. 423 \nSold by @itachibot In bacterial operons, a regulatory gene, like the lac I gene, which is present upstream of a set of \nstructural genes, codes for a repressor protein (a transacting factor). The repressor protein binds \nto the operator site and interferes with the progress of RNA polymerase. This blocks transcription \nof the structural genes and is an example of negative regulation of gene transcription.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The operon model attempts to explain the coordinated control of gene expression in bacteria. In bacteria, the structural genes that code for proteins involved in a particular metabolic pathway \nare often found sequentially grouped on the chromosome. The cis-acting regulatory elements that \ndetermine the transcription of these genes are also grouped with the structural genes. The transcription product of the entire operon is a single polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA). \nThe structural genes described above are coordinately controlled, that is, turned on or off as a \nunit. This entire package, of structural and regulatory genes, is referred to as an operon. An \nexample of this is the lac operon in Escherichia coli. Note: Gene regulation in bacteria is important in order to: • Enable response to environmental stimuli • Allow cells to adjust promptly to changes in the growth medium • Alter biochemical capabilities appropriate for available substrate 424 \nSold by @itachibot",

Corepressor is a substance that facilitate the inhibition of gene expression. In prokaryotes, \ncorepressors are small molecules whereas, in eukaryotes, corepressors are proteins. A corepressor \nbinds to the repressors and activates the repressor transcription factor. The repressor, in turn, \nbinds to the operator site, thereby blocking the transcription from the structural genes.

The tryptophan operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, trp A, which \nencode enzymes required for the synthesis of tryptophan. It also contains a promoter that binds to \nRNA polymerase. Its operator blocks transcription when it is bound to repressor protein \nsynthesized by the repressor gene (trp R).

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Two potential devices that eukaryotic cells use to regulate transcription are as follows DNA \nmethylation and histone acetylation. DNA methylation occurs by methyltransferases that use S-adenosyl-methionine as the methyl \ndonor. It silences gene expression. Histone acetylation decrease the positive charge on histone proteins, thus decreasing the strength \nof their association with negatively charged DNA. This chromatin remodeling relaxes the \nnucleosome, allowing transcription factors access to specific regions on the DNA. Thus, histone \nacetylation improves gene expression. Note: In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, gene expression is primarily regulated at the level of \ntranscription. 427 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Methylation does not favour euchromatin formation due to changes cytosine residues at CpG \nislands in DNA. The transcriptional regulatory regions of active genes often contain a high frequency of CpG \ndinucleotides (referred to as CpG islands) and they are normally unmethylated. Therefore, \nmethylation is an epigenetic modification that inactivates DNA, and hinders the formation of \neuchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). Epigenetic changes include alterations of \nchromatin structure by: • Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides • Modification of histones by acetylation or methylation • Changes in higher-order chromosome structure Sumoylation of histones (SUMO - Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) is associated with \ntranscription repression. Other possible roles of posttranslationally modified histones: • Acetylation of core histones is associated with chromosomal assembly during DNA replication. • Phosphorylation of histone H1 is associated with the condensation of chromosomes during the \nreplication cycle. • ADP-ribosylation of histones is associated with DNA repair. • Methylation of histones is correlated with activation and repression of gene transcription. • Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is associated with the activation or inactivation of gene \ntranscription. • Monoubiquitylation is associated with gene activation, repression, and heterochromatic gene \nsilencing.",
