There are various microarray techniques used in clinical practice which are described below: DNA Microarray technique or DNA chip: • To the DNA chip containing known oligonucleotide sequence, flourescent labelled unknown \noligonucleotide is added. • The computerised algorithms can decode the unknown oligonucleotide, by detecting the location \nof flourescent hybridization pattern on the chip. • This technique is used for genotyping or genome sequencing. RNA microarray: RNA microarray can detect gene expression. • To the known array of oligonucleotide, flourecently labelled cDNA prepared from unknown \nmRNA is added, and the unknown cDNA is decoded • This technique is used for gene expression studies Protein microarray: • Known antibodies placed on glass slide and flourescently tagged target protein added. Target \nprotein is detected by antigen antibody interaction. • This technique is used in study of proteomics 447 \nSold by @itachibot",

The process of PCR is as follows: The DNA sample is first heat-denatured at &gt;90°C (90-96 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes) to \nseparate the two strands of the template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers (which \nattach to the 3' end of the flanking sequence) are added in excess, are allowed to anneal to the 448 \nSold by @itachibot DNA (typically at 50-›5°C) in order to generate the required template-primer hybridization \ncomplex. Under suitable conditions and presence of deoxynucleotides, elongation of the DNA \nstand occurs. The number of copies produced in the presence of an unlimited supply of deoxynucleotides and \nenzymes is given by - 2 to the power n (where n is the number of PCR cycles) • 20 cycles provide an amplification of 220 = ‰06 or ‰ million copies • 30 cycles provides an amplification of 230 =‰09 or ‰ billion copies Below is an image showing the various ingredients for carrying out PCR.",

        "a": "Universal",
        "b": "Unambiguous",
        "c": "Degeneracy",
        "d": "Non-punctuated"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The wobble hypothesis explains the degeneracy of the genetic code. The wobble hypothesis states that codon-anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson–Crick \nrules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less \nstringent for the third/last base. It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one \ncodon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is \nreferred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis. The first base of the anticodon moves to permit nontraditional pairing with the last base of the \ncodon. This movement is called wobble and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is \nnot as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 6‰ tRNA species are not \nrequired to read the 6‰ codons. For example, three codons for glycine—GGU, GGC, and GGA—can form a base pair from one \nanticodon, 3 CCI 5 ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below. Other options: Option A: The genetic code is universal because it is the same for all living organisms. 449 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: The genetic code is unambiguous because each codon is specific for only one amino \nacid. Example: GGA only codes for Glycine. Option D: The genetic code is non-punctuated. This means that once the reading commences at a \nspecific start codon, it is continuous and is read continuously as triplets until a stop codon is \nreached without stopping. 450 \nSold by @itachibot",
