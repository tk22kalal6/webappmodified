Glucose transport in our body mainly occurs through sodium-independent glucose transporters, \nwhich include GLUT transporters and to a small extent through sodium-dependent glucose \ntransporters, which include SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. Insulin induces the movement of intracellular \nGLUT 4 molecules to the cell surface and thus increases glucose uptake. In type 2 diabetes \nmellitus, membrane GLUT 4 is reduced, leading to insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells.",

      "explanation": "The process of reconversion of lactate formed in the muscles and RBCs, back into glucose inside \nthe liver is called Cori's cycle. Lactic acid is a metabolic byproduct formed after glycolysis in tissues such as the skeletal muscles \nand RBCs. The lactate so formed is transported into the liver and kidney. Here, it gets reconverted \nback into glucose. This entire process is called Cori’s cycle or the glucose–lactate cycle. Cahill cycle is also called as glucose–alanine cycle. In the fasting state, there is a significant output \nof alanine from skeletal muscle obtained from glycolysis of muscle glycogen. Alanine is derived \nfrom the transamination of pyruvate obtained from glycolysis. Alanine is then exported to the \nliver where it undergoes transamination again back to pyruvate and enters gluconeogenesis. 39 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Pentose phosphate pathway is otherwise known as Warburg-Dickens-Horecker Cycle.",

This alanine is shunted out into the \ncirculation, and later on into the liver. Here in the liver, another round of transamination takes \nplace, and the alanine is reconverted back into pyruvate.

Malate shuttle is a biochemical system for translocating impermeable electrons (NADH) or \nsubstrates (oxaloacetate), in the form of a permeable substance, malate. The semipermeable inner \nmitochondrial membrane is permeable to malate. In glycolysis, the impermeable NADH produced in the cytosol (of liver and cardiac cells) are taken \nup into mitochondria in the form of malate for oxidation via malate shuttle. In gluconeogenesis, pyruvate in the mitochondria generates impermeable oxaloacetate, which is \nconverted to aspartate and translocated to the cytosol via malate shuttle for the synthesis of \nglucose.",
