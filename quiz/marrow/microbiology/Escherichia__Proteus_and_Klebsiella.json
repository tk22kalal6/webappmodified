      "explanation": "This patient with watery diarrhea most likely has traveller’s diarrhea caused by Enterotoxigenic \nEscherichia coli (ETEC). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the most common organism that causes diarrhea in travelers.

Other options: Option A: Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) causes infantile diarrhea in developing countries. It \nadheres to the mucosal surface of the small intestine using E. coli adherent factor (EAF) and locus \nof enterocyte effacement (LEE) and causes effacement of microvilli. Option B: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) produces verocytotoxin, which targets vascular \nendothelium. It causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Option D: Enteroinvasive E.coli (EIEC) invades interstitial epithelial cells in the intestine and \ncauses a condition resembling shigellosis.

E. coli is the second most common cause of diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is the \nmost common cause. EPEC causes watery diarrhea which is self-limiting. EPEC adheres to the mucosal cells of the small bowel and causes loss of microvilli (effacement). \nThis leads to the formation of filamentous actin pedestals or cuplike structures and occasionally \nmay cause entry of the EPEC into the mucosal cells. Pathogenicity requires the presence of two important factors: • Bundle-forming pilus encoded by plasmid containing EPEC adherence factor (EAF). • Chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island.

Other options: Option A - Strains of E. coli producing verocytotoxin or Shiga toxin (stx2a-g) can cause diarrheal \ndisease ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. The most \ncommon EHEC belongs to serotype O157:H7. Option C - In EHEC diarrhea, fecal leukocytes are commonly seen (70%) but although it is an \ninfectious condition, fever is not seen. The absence of fever can lead to its misdiagnosis as a \nnon-infectious condition such as intussusception or ischemic bowel disease. Option D - The disease is transmitted through contaminated feces.
