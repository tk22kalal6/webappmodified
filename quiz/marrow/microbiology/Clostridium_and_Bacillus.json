Metronidazole is preferred for antibiotic therapy. Antitoxin \nshould be given early in an attempt to deactivate any circulating tetanus toxin.

The incubation period from ingestion of contaminated food to the onset of symptoms in \nfood-borne botulism is usually 8–36 h but can be as long as 10 days and is dose-dependent. The \nclinical syndrome of botulism consists of bilateral cranial-nerve palsies that may progress to \nrespiratory compromise, a bilateral descending flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles, and even \ndeath. 158 \nSold by @itachibot Cranial nerve deficits may manifest as some of the following: • diplopia • dysarthria • dysphonia • ptosis • ophthalmoplegia • facial paralysis and impaired gag reflex The absence of cranial nerve palsies makes botulism highly unlikely, as does a lack of cranial \nnerve deficits at the onset of illness. Pupillary reflexes may be depressed and fixed or dilated \npupils are sometimes noted. The cornerstones of treatment for botulism are meticulous intensive care and administration of \nbotulinum antitoxin. Option A: In poliomyelitis, weakness is generally asymmetric, more proximal than distal, and may \ninvolve the legs (most commonly), the arms, or the abdominal, thoracic, or bulbar muscles.

Toxigenic culture is the most \nsensitive method for the detection of Clostridium difficle infection. The methods for diagnosis of Clostridium difficle infection are: • Toxigenic culture- Anaerobic incubation of the sample in cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar \n(CCFA) or its variant for several days. This is followed by identification of the organism in the \ngrowth and tests to confirm toxin production. This method has a sensitivity of 100%. • Cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA)- A stool filtrate is prepared and applied onto a \nmonolayer of an appropriate cell line. The cells are observed for toxin-induced cytopathic effect \n(CPE). This is followed by a neutralization assay to confirm that the CPE is attributable to \nC.difficile toxins. Sensitivity is around 75-85% when compared to toxigenic culture (reference \nstandard) • Nucleic acid amplification tests (e.g.PCR)- More sensitive (93.3%) for C.difficile detection than \ntoxin immunoassays but less sensitive than toxigenic culture. • Toxin immunoassays- Enzyme immunoassays using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against \nC.difficile toxins.
