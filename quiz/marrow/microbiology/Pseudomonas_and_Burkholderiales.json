      "explanation": "Bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis with a history of repeated lung infections since childhood and \nevelated sweat chloride concentration suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). Pseudomonas \naeruginosa is a common etiological agent associated with chronic airway infection in patients \nwith cystic fibrosis (CF). 242 \nSold by @itachibot In cystic fibrosis, there is thick inspissated mucus and impaired mucociliary clearance. Due to \nthese factors, lungs are often colonized in infancy and early childhood with Staphylococcus aureus \nand Haemophilus influenzae. In adulthood, they are replaced by P. aeruginosa. This results in \nchronic inflammation, which leads to airway modelling and bronchiectasis. Note: Burkholderia cepacia complex is an opportunistic environmental pathogen. It causes fatal \nrespiratory distress and septicemia in CF patients. This is termed as 'cepacia syndrome'.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Scombroid fish poisoning is associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It follows the consumption of both scombroid (mackerel-like) fish and nonscombroid fish that \nhave not been refrigerated properly. The musculature of these dark- or red-fleshed fish undergoes \ndecomposition by Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella species, and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa. There is consequent decarboxylation of the amino acid L-histidine to \nform histamine. A second compound is thought to play a causative role in this intoxication because large doses of \noral histamine do not reproduce the affliction. The toxin or toxins involved are heat stable and are \nnot destroyed by cooking or freezing. Symptoms develop within 15–90 min of ingestion. Most cases are mild, with tingling of lips and \nmouth, mild abdominal discomfort, and nausea. The more severe and commonly described \npresentation includes flushing, conjunctival hyperemia, pruritus, urticaria, and \nangioedema. Without treatment, the symptoms generally resolve within 8–12 h.",

      "explanation": "The action of exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is similar to that of the diphtheria toxin. Both exotoxin A and diphtheria toxin cause ADP ribosylation of EF-2 and inhibit protein \nsynthesis. Exotoxin A is a single-chain polypeptide with A and B fragments. The B fragment binds \nthe toxin while the A fragment inactivates EF-2 in the presence of nicotinamide adenine \ndinucleotide (NAD).

Whitmore isolated the bacillus, \nand hence, it is known as Whitmore bacillus and melioidosis is called Whitmore's disease. \nMelioidosis is similar in presentation to glanders disease (caused by Burkholderia mallei). \nHumans are infected tby contact with contaminated soil via skin abrasions. Types of melioidosis: • Acute - It causes acute pneumonia with upper lobe infiltrates or severe necrotizing disease. It \ncan also mimic tuberculosis with fever, cough, hemoptysis. It may lead to septicemia. • Chronic - It can lead to the development of multiple caseous or suppurative foci, with skin and \nsubcutaneous abscesses. These can lead to lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy. It may involve \nbones and other internal organs. The bacillus has a safety-pin appearance on methylene blue staining. Treatment is divided into \ntwo stages: an intensive 2 week phase of ceftazidime or a carbapenem followed by at least 12 \nweeks of oral cotrimoxazole to eradicate the organism and prevent relapse.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The development of ulcerative tracheobronchitis after contact with an infected horse is suggestive \nof glanders which is caused by Burkholderia mallei. It is an oxidase variable organism. In this case, the horse likely had glanders, which presents with fever, pneumonia, and \nsubcutaneous nodules called Farcy buds. Discharges from the respiratory tract and skin are highly \ninfectious and can be transmitted to humans through close contact (occupational route). The 244 \nSold by @itachibot horse-groomer likely contracted the infection by the inhalational route and developed acute \nglanders, which is characterised by fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge and ulcerative necrosis of \nupper respiratory tract (ulcerative tracheobronchitis). It may lead to septicemia and has a high \nfatality rate. Percutaneous exposure causes local suppurative skin lesions with associated regional \nlymphadenopathy. B. mallei is a non-motile Gram-negative bacillus causing Glanders disease. It is an aerobe and a \nfacultative anaerobe. It is oxidase variable i.e. it is usually oxidase negative but may occasionally \nshow a positive reaction. It is a biosafety level 3 pathogen and so must be handled only in \nspecialised laboratories. When male guinea pigs are inoculated intraperitoneally with suspected \ninfectious material, it causes Strauss reaction. B. mallei sets up a necrotizing inflammation in the \nscrotal sac within a few days and can be confirmed bacteriologically.",

B. cepacia complex strains are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides, polymixin, first and \nsecond-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefotetan) and carboxypenicillins. This antimicrobial \nresistance is mediated by efflux pumps, antimicrobial degradation, modifying enzymes or altered \nmembrane functions. B. cepacia is a Gram-negative bacillus which can cause severe necrotizing pneumonia in patients \nwith chronic granulomatous disease. It can lead to fatal septicemia in patients with cystic fibrosis. Antimicrobial agents that are effective against B. cepacia complex include meropenem, \nceftazidime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin and temocillin.",

Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus. It causes whooping cough or pertussis in \nchildren. It can be isolated on the enriched medium Bordet-Genou medium (potato-blood-glycerol agar). \nAfter incubation for 48 to 72 hours, B. pertussis colonies are small, dome-shaped, smooth, \nopaque, viscid, greyish white, refractile, and glistening resembling 'bisected pearls' or 'mercury \ndrops' and are surrounded by a hazy zone of hemolysis. If growth is confluent, an 'aluminium \npaint' appearance is seen. In culture films, Bordetella pertussis bacilli tend to be arranged in loose \nclumps, with clear spaces in between, giving a 'thumbprint' appearance. B. parapertussis (option A) grows on nutrient agar with the production of a brown, diffusible \npigment after two days.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Post-tussive vomiting and bouts of cough in an unimmunized child points to a diagnosis of \npertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis. It secretes pertussis toxin (PT), which acts by ADP \nribosylation and disrupts signal transduction of many cell types. This promotes lymphocytosis. The pertussis toxin disrupts protein synthesis and causes necrosis of parts of the epithelium, \nleading to pseudomembrane formation. Pertussis toxin also promotes sensitization to histamine \nand enhances insulin secretion but these effects have not been demonstrable in patients. They are \nonly seen in experimental animals. B. pertussis also produces other toxins like: • Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT)- It acts by catalysing the production of cAMP by various types of \ncells and inhibiting phagocytosis. • Heat labile toxin (HLT)- It is a cytoplasmic protein present in all bordetellae. It is dermonecrotic \nand lethal in mice. Its pathogenic role is not known. • Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT)- It is low molecular weight peptidoglycan which induces ciliary damage \nin hamster trachea.",

Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is \nresponsible for facilitating the adhesion of Bordetella pertussis to the respiratory epithelium. Bordetella pertussis produces 3 hemagglutinins: Pertussis toxin (PT), lipid factor and FHA. FHA is \na surface protein and is readily shed. Along with fimbrae, it helps in the adhesion of B. pertussis \nto the cilia of the respiratory epithelium and to erythrocytes. FHA and PT also promote secondary \ninfection by coating other bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pneumococci. They then \nassists their binding to respiratory epithelium.
