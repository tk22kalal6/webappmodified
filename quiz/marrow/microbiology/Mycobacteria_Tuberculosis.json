      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Mycobacteria are acid-fast due to the presence of mycolic acid in their cell walls. On being stained with carbol fuchsin or fluorescent dyes such as auramine-O or rhodamine, they \nresist decolourization by 20% sulphuric acid and absolute alcohol for 10 minutes. This property is \nreferred to as acid and alcohol fastness and is routinely used to identify mycobacteria.",

      "explanation": "NaOH and N-acetylcysteine are used for the digestion and decontamination of sputum used in \nsmear preparation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 170 \nSold by @itachibot Sputum and specimens from non-sterile sites need prior treatment for digestion (to liquefy the \nthick pus), decontamination (to inhibit the normal flora), and concentration (to increase the yield) \nbefore they can be used for testing. Methods used for digestion and decontamination of sputum: • Petroff’s method- Uses 4% NaOH and HCl. • N-acetyl cysteine (NALC) + 2% NaOH - NALC liquefies the sputum and NaOH kills the normal \nflora. This method is better suited for automated culture systems and is superior to Petroff’s \nmethod. Note: Formalin or hypochlorite can be used only if smear microscopy is being done. They are not \nuseful for culture or animal pathogenicity testing.",

The WHO recommends its use worldwide as the initial diagnostic test in adults and children who \nare presumed to have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB.

The disc diffusion technique is not suitable for testing Mycobacterium tuberculosis because the \norganism grows so slowly that the drug has time to diffuse throughout the medium, and sharp \nzones of inhibition are not seen. 174 \nSold by @itachibot Methods used in the drug susceptibility testing of M.tb include: For agar-based methods, ‹H10 or ‹H11 Middlebrook media are used and only the proportion \nmethod can be applied.

It has been used for \nthe diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in patients with HIV(who frequently have a negative Mantoux \ntest). Interferon-gamma release assays include: • QuantiFERON-TB Gold • T-SPOT.TB QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantitates the amount of IFN- produced by CD4+ T cells in response to \nthe antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT- Plus) is an \nimproved version of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. QuantiFERON-TB Gold detects only \nTB-specific CD4+ responses. However, QuantiFeron-TB Gold Plus detects both CDù+ and CD4+ \nT-cell responses to TB-specific antigens. T-SPOT.TB determines the total number of individual effector T cells expressing IFN-. 175 \nSold by @itachibot The TrueNat TB test is a new molecular test that can diagnose TB in one hour as well as test for \nrifampicin resistance. This test uses a sputum sample taken from the patient. Only about 0.5 ml of \nthe sample is required. Gene Xpert is also a molecular method of testing that cannot use blood as \na sample.

Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen is a lipopolysaccharide present in the mycobacterial cell wall, \nreleased from metabolically active cells or degenerating cells of patients having tuberculosis. \nUrine LAM is a useful tool in diagnosing tuberculosis, especially in patients with HIV and low \nCD4+ T cell count. Most diagnostic tests for tuberculosis rely on sputum samples, which are difficult to obtain and \nhave low sensitivity in immunocompromised patients, patients with disseminated TB, and \nchildren, delaying treatment initiation.
