      "explanation": "467 \nSold by @itachibot A swelling with multiple discharging sinuses with brown granules that is unresponsive to the \nantibiotics is suggestive of eumycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis. Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia and \nbone, which most often affects the foot or the hand. It can be divided into three types- \neumycetomas, actinomycetomas and botryomycosis. Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil or \nvegetable sources. Within host tissues, the organisms develop to form compacted colonies (grains) \n0.5–2 mm in diameter, the color of which depends on the organism responsible. It results in \ntumefactions, deformities and draining sinuses discharging these grains or granules. Laboratory Diagnosis: • A. Direct Examination: The presence of grains in pus collected from draining sinuses or in \nbiopsy material is diagnostic. • B. Culture Samples should also be cultured, at both 25–30°C and 37°C, on brain-heart infusion \nagar or blood agar for actinomycetes and on Sabouraud agar (without cycloheximide) for fungi. Treatment: The management of eumycetoma is difficult, involving surgical debridement or excision and \nchemotherapy. Actinomycetoma on the other hand, responds well to rifampicin in combination \nwith sulfonamides or cotrimoxazole. Option A: Actinomadura madurae causes actinomycetoma which would respond to antibiotics.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with pulmonary and cutaneous involvement along with a history of \ntravel to North America and the characteristic culture findings suggests the diagnosis \nof Blastomycosis caused by Blastomyces dermitidis. Blastomycosis is a chronic infection, characterized by the formation of suppurative and \ngranulomatous lesions, especially, in the lungs and skin. It is most common in North America and so is also called North Amerian Blastomycosis. The causative organism is a thermally dimorphic fungus called Blastomyces dermatitidis. Humans \nare infected by the inhalation of spores in the soil. Blastomycosis can present in three forms: • Pulmonary disease: • Presents with cough, sputum production, chest pain, and fever • Hilar lymphadenopathy may be present • Focal or diffuse consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation may occur. • Resembles TB and Histoplasmosis • Cutaneous disease: • Involvement of face and exposed parts of the skin • Skin lesion: ulcerated verrucous granulomas with an advancing border and central scarring. The \nborder is filled with microabscesses and has a sharp, sloping edge. (image in stem) 470 \nSold by @itachibot • Disseminated disease: • Multiple skin lesions are the most common presentation • Highly fatal • Genitourinary tract (especially prostate) is frequently involved • Bone involvement resembles chronic osteomyelitis. It can be diagnosed based on culture findings. Characterictic findings include the presence \nof thick-walled round yeast cell with a single broad-based bud when cultured at 37°C. (figure of 8 \nappearance) Treatment: • Localised mild/moderate disease - Itraconazole (6 months) • Disseminated/ severe disease - Amphotericin B",

Examples: • Claviceps  Ergot poisoning • Coprine  coprine poisoning • Inocybe  muscarine poisoning Mycotoxicosis: Fungal toxins contaminate food and cause toxic effects. Examples: • Aflatoxins: These are a type of mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus species of fungi, such as \nAspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. • Fusarium toxins • Citrinin toxin was first isolated from Penicillium citrinum.",
