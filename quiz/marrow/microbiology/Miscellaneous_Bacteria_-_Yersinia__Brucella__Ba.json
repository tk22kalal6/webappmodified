      "explanation": "Milk ring test (MRT) is positive for Brucella. It is used for the detection of infected animals in \ndairy farms. A sample of whole milk is mixed with a drop of Brucella antigen and incubated at 70 °C for 40–50 \nmin. If antibodies are present in the milk, the bacilli are agglutinated and rise with the cream to \nform a blue ring at the top, leaving the rest of the milk unstained (MRT positive). If antibodies are \nabsent, the solution remains uniformly blue (MRT negative).",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella sp which presents with undulant fever. It is \nreferred to as undulant fever because of the rising and falling of fever like a wave (remittent \nfever). Patients may also have arthralgia, muscular pain, sweating, loss of weight, and appetite. \nCNS symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and depression might also occur. Other options Option A: Pel-Ebstein fever is seen in Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is characterized by fever lasting 3–\n10 days followed by afebrile periods of 3–10 days. 271 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Relapsing fever is seen in infection with Borrelia recurrentis in which days of fever are \nfollowed by a several-day afebrile period and then relapse into additional days of fever. A similar \npicture is also seen in malaria. Option D: Saddleback fever is seen in dengue.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario of remittent fever with anemia with a positive Rose Bengal card test is \nsuggestive of brucellosis. Castaneda method for blood culture is used to isolate Brucella sp. In the Castaneda method, blood is inoculated into a bottle of trypticase soy broth or brucella broth \nin a biphasic blood culture bottle (with liquid and solid media in the same bottle). This method \nminimizes materials and manipulation, thus reducing the chances of contamination and risk of \ninfection to laboratory workers. Blood cultures are positive in only 30–50% of cases even when repeated samples are \ntested. B.melitensis and B.suis are isolated more readily than B.abortus. The below image shows \nCastaneda's bottle. Lab diagnosis of brucellosis is done using the following methods: • Blood culture with • Castaneda's method - recommended • BACTEC - an automated method. It is faster than Castaneda's method. • Serological tests: • Standard agglutination test (SAT) • ELISA for specific IgG/IgM 272 \nSold by @itachibot • Dipstick assays • Detection in milk and infected cattle is carried out by: • Microscopic demonstration by staining or immunofluorescence • Milk ring test • Rose Bengal card test",

      "explanation": "The given scenario of a farmer with fever, weightloss and back pain with a predominant \nlymphocytosis points towards a diagnosis of acute brucellosis. The drugs of choice for this \ncondition in adults are intramuscular streptomycin with doxycycline. The usual alternative regimen (and the current World Health Organization recommendation) is \nrifampin plus doxycycline. However, this is associated with a higher relapse rate, possibly because \nrifampicin increases clearance of doxycycline and reduces serum doxycycline levels.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of rat-bite fever. This can be caused by Streptobacillus \nmoniliformis and Spirillum minus. Rat-bite fever (RBF) is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia which usually occurs days or \nweeks after a bite. The two types of rat-bite fever are: • Streptobacillary RBF develops 2–10 days after a rat bite, associated with sudden onset of fever, \nheadache, and myalgia followed by petechial rash and arthritis. It is also called Haverhill fever or \nErythema arthrititicum epidemicum. • Spirillary RBF is similar to streptobacillary type but it is also associated with regional \nlymphadenopathy. It is also called Sodoku. Diagnosis is based on demonstration of causative organisms in peripheral blood films. Serology \ncan also be used for diagnosis. RBF is treated with intravenous Penicillin G. Alternative drugs include ampicillin, cefuroxime, \nand cefotaxime. Note: Pasteurella multocida causes cellulitis and lymphangitis following bites by cats and dogs. Bartonella henselae causes cat sratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. Borellia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. 273 \nSold by @itachibot",

They are epithelial cells \nwith their surface covered by adherent bacilli seen in stained or unstained films. Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial infection characterized by a malodorous (fishy smell) vaginal \ndischarge. Causative organisms include: • Gardnerella vaginalis • Mycoplasma hominis • Prevotella • Ureaplasma • Peptostreptococcus. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed using Amsel's criteria and Nugent's score: 1. Amsel's Criteria: (any 3 should be present) • Thin, white/yellow homogenous vaginal discharge • pH of Vaginal fluid&gt;4.5 • Fishy odour of discharge accentuated on adding 10% KOH (Whiff test) • Clue cells seen on microscopy 2. Nugent's score is obtained by counting the number of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobilincus and \nlactobacillus in the gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario of sudden-onset fever with painful lymphadenopathy and a history of \nsimilar complaints in the community is suggestive of a diagnosis of plague caused by Yersinia \npestis. The septicemic form of the disease may be acquired directly if the bacteria enter the \nbloodstream via infected blood transfusions. Wild rodents and their infected fleas are the primary reservoirs of Yersinia pestis. Infection is \ntransmitted to humans by the bite of infected fleas. Human plague occurs in 3 clinical forms (in increasing order of severity): bubonic plague&lt; \npneumonic plague&lt; septicemic plague Bubonic plague- It is the most common variety of the disease. It is named after the buboes \nmeaning swollen lymph nodes, which typically develop within a week after an infected flea bite. \nOther clinical features include sudden onset of fever and chills, headache, and fatigue. Pneumonic plague- Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs. It is the most virulent \nform of plague. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other \nhumans. The symptoms include dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, fever, and hemoptysis. Septicemic plague- When the bacteria enter the bloodstream directly and multiply there, it is \nknown as septicemic plague. When left untreated, both bubonic and pneumonic plague can lead \nto septicemic plague.",

      "explanation": "This clinical vignette of a patient with HIV infections and the violaceous lesions with a \nneutrophilic infiltrate is suggestive of bacillary angiomatosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is seen in severely immunocompromised patients and is caused by B. \nhenselae or B. quintana. It is characterized by neovascular proliferative lesions involving the skin. \nIt consists of lobular proliferation of small blood vessels lined by enlarged endothelial cells \ninterspersed with mixed infiltrates of neutrophils and lymphocytes, with a predominance of \nthe former. Both bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi's sarcoma can have the clinical presentation mentioned in \nthe question. However, the major differentiating factor is the microscopic examination: • Bacillary angiomatosis predominantly has mixed infiltrate accompanied by neutrophils with \nclumps of bacilli. • Kaposi's sarcoma predominantly has plasma cells and lymphocytic infiltrates.",

It is caused by \nBartonella henselae. Bartonella henselae is an intracellular, pleomorphic, gram-negative bacillus. They can be \nidentified in lymph node biopsy with Warthin-Starry Silver stain. In addition to cat scratch \ndisease, in immunocompromised individuals, it can also cause bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis \nhepatis. 281 \nSold by @itachibot In immunocompetent hosts, cat scratch disease is a self limiting illness. However in patients with \nsevere disease, azithromycin can be used to treat the infection.",
