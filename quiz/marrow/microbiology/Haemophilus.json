      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario of bacterial pneumonia in a splenectomised individual along with the image \nshowing satellitism on blood agar points towards an infection due to Hemophilus influenzae. Pneumonia can occur as a part of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). This is a fatal \npost-splenectomy complication occuring due to infections with encapsulated organisms such as S. \npneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis. It can be prevented by vaccinating against these \norganisms within 2 weeks of undergoing splenectomy. Satellitism is seen when S. aureus is streaked across a plate of blood agar on which H. influenzae \nhas been inoculated. After overnight incubation, the colonies of H. influenzae will be large and \nwell developed alongside the streak of Staphylococcus and smaller when they are farther away \nfrom the streak. This is due to the release of factor V by lysis of RBCs mediated by S. aureus. \nFactor V is required for the growth of H. influenzae.

Hemophilus meningitis is more common in \nchildren between 3 months and 3 years of age and not common in young adults.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette and 'thumb sign' on the X-ray are suggestive of acute epiglottitis caused \nby Hemophilus influenzae. It is an acute inflammation of the epiglottis causing obstructive laryngitis and presents with high \nfever, severe sore throat, tachycardia, systemic toxicity, and drooling as patients are unable to \nswallow. The patient characteristically leans forward while sitting for ease of breathing. The diagnosis often is made on clinical grounds. On direct fiberoptic laryngoscopy, the typical \nedematous cherry-red epiglottis is visualized. Neck radiographs reveal an enlarged edematous \nepiglottis (Thumb sign). The below image shows the Thumb sign. In some countries, widespread vaccination against Hib has drastically decreased acute epiglottitis \ncases in children by over 90%. However, the incidence in adults has remained largely unchanged \nsince the Hib vaccine was introduced. Despite vaccination efforts, many pediatric cases of \nepiglottitis today are still caused by Hib due to either lack of vaccination or vaccine \nineffectiveness. In adults and increasingly in children, other bacterial pathogens, particularly \ngroup A Streptococcus, have been linked to cases of epiglottitis. Treatment includes airway management followed by administration of antibiotics like \nampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Pneumonia due to a gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus growing on chocolate agar which is \ncatalase and oxidase-positive is most likely Haemophilus influenza. Haemophilus pneumonia typically occurs in infants and is accompanied by empyema and \nsometimes meningitis as well. In older children and adults, the picture is of lobar \npneumonia. Sputum is collected for the detection and isolation of Hemophilus. As the bacillus is \nvery sensitive to low temperatures, specimens should never be refrigerated before inoculation. \nH.infiuenzae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing bacillus, exhibiting considerable 257 \nSold by @itachibot pleomorphism. In sputum, it usually occurs as clusters of coccobacillary forms. The bacillus has fastidious growth requirements. The accessory growth factors, named X and V, \npresent in the blood are essential for growth. Catalase and oxidase reactions are positive. Nitrates are reduced to nitrites. Biotyping has been done on the \nbasis of indole production. Cultures may be preserved for about a month on chocolate agar slopes. Chocolate agar is made by \nheating blood agar to 80-90°C for 15-20 minutes. This causes the release of V factor from within \nthe erythrocytes. Treatment- Amoxycillin-clavulanate or clarithromycin is more effective in treating respiratory \ninfections by Haemophilus influenzae.",

The most common cause of \nthese are non-typable H. influenzae which lack a capsule and so capsular antigen cannot be a \nvirulence factor. All H. influenzae have the following virulence factors: • Outer membrane proteins (OMP) • Lipooligosaccharide(LOS) • Pili In addition to the above factors, H. influenzae type b also has its capsular polysaccharide as a \nvirulence factor.
