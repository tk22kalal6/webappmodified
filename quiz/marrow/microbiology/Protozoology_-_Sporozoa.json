      "explanation": "541 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical history and the blood smear showing multiple ring forms in RBCs are \nsuggestive of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Falciparum malaria infects both young and mature erythrocytes. Binucleate rings (double \nchromatin) seen in RBCs are common and they resemble stereo headphones in appearance. The \nrings are often attached to the margins of the red cells and are described as form applique or \naccole. There may be several rings present within a single erythrocyte. Hypnozoites are not present in P. falciparum infection. The peripheral smear finding of P. falciparum malaria are: • Multiple ring form • Accole form • Absent schizont • Banana shaped gametocytes • Maurer's dots The below image shows banana shaped gametocyte:",

      "explanation": "The schizont stage is usually not seen in the peripheral smear of individuals having Plasmodium \nfalciparum malaria. A mature schizont contains merozoites and hemozoin. This will burst to release merozoites into \ncirculation. The merozoites invade fresh erythrocytes, in which they go through the same process \nof development called erythrocytic schizogony or merogony. After the ring form is formed in peripheral blood, the remaining RBC cycle of falciparum occurs in \nthe capillaries of the brain and other internal organs. Hence only the ring form is seen in the \nperipheral smear. 542 \nSold by @itachibot However, for other Plasmodium species, all erythrocytic stages occur in peripheral blood vessels.

The two types of smears are prepared from the peripheral blood are: • Thin smear– It is used for detecting the parasites and determining the species. They are air-dried \nrapidly and stained with Romanowsky stains. • Thick smear– It is more sensitive and examined under oil immersion microscope.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Sabin-Feldman dye test is used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. It is based on the principle that the presence of anti-toxoplasma antibodies in the patient's \nserum inhibits the staining of trophozoites by alkaline methylene blue dye. Toxoplasma trophozoites and complement are added to the patient's serum which is then \nincubated for an hour at 37°C. After incubation, methylene blue dye is added. If anti-toxoplasma antibodies are present in the serum, these are activated by complement and \nthe parasite membrane is lysed. Thus, the trophozoites are not stained (positive result). If there are no antibodies, trophozoites will take up the stain and appear blue under the \nmicroscope. This is considered to be a negative result. The dilution of the test serum at which 50% of the tachyzoites are not stained is reported as the \nantibody titer of the test serum. The test is highly sensitive and specific. It cannot differentiate between recent or past infections as it detects only IgG antibodies.",

Exoenteric cycle occurs in intermediate \nhosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc. 546 \nSold by @itachibot Both asexual reproduction (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) occur within the \nmucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine of the cat. The tachyzoites and tissue cyst represent \nstages in asexual multiplication, while the oocyst is formed by sexual reproduction. All three forms, tachyzoites, tissue cyst, and oocyst occur in the definitive host. Only the asexual \nforms, tachyzoites, and tissue cysts are present in the intermediate host. Tachyzoites continue to multiply and spread locally by the lymphatic system and blood, while the \nbradyzoites multiply slowly inside the tissue cyst. The dormant bradyzoites inside the cyst may be \nreactivated on immune suppression causing renewed infection in the host. The below image shows the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.",
