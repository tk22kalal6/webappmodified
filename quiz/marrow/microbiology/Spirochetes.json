      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given image shows Treponema pallidum demonstrated by Levaditi's method. Single painless \nulcer with indurated base points towards the diagnosis of syphilis. Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacillus. It is a sexually transmitted \ninfection. Intrauterine transmission can lead to congenital syphilis. It shows corkscrew motility which can be demonstrated by darkfield microscopy. Treponema can be stained by silver impregnation methods. • Fontana's method is used on smear • Levaditi's method is used for tissue sections The clinical manifestations of syphilis include: Primary syphilis: The typical primary chancre usually begins as a single painless papule \nthat rapidly becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, with a characteristic cartilaginous \nconsistency on palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer. Inguinal lymphadenopathy is bilateral and may occur with anal as well as with genital chancres. \nThe chancre generally heals within 4–6 weeks (range, 2–12 weeks), but lymphadenopathy may \npersist for months. Secondary syphilis: The various features include mucocutaneous or cutaneous lesions and \ngeneralized nontender lymphadenopathy. macular, papular, papulosquamous, and occasionally \npustular syphilides. Other features of secondary syphilis include sore throat, fever, weight loss, \nmalaise, anorexia, headache, and meningismus. Ocular findings associated with secondary (or \nlater/ unknown-stage) syphilis include pupillary abnormalities and optic neuritis as well as the 325 \nSold by @itachibot classic iritis or uveitis. Latent syphilis: Early latent syphilis is limited to the first year after infection, whereas late latent \nsyphilis is defined as that of 1 year’s duration (or of unknown duration). T. pallidum may still seed \nthe bloodstream intermittently during the latent stage, and latent syphilis in a pregnant woman \nmay infect the fetus in utero. Neurosyphilis: The major clinical categories of symptomatic neurosyphilis include meningeal, \nmeningovascular, and parenchymatous syphilis. Cardiovascular syphilis: Cardiovascular involvement results in uncomplicated aortitis, aortic \nregurgitation, saccular aneurysm (usually of the ascending aorta), or coronary ostial stenosis. Congenital syphilis: The earliest manifestations of congenital syphilis include rhinitis, or \n“snuffles”; mucocutaneous lesions, bone changes, including periostitis detectable by x-ray \nexamination of long bones; hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, jaundice, \nthrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. Serologic tests for syphilis recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC): • Screening or diagnosis (RPR or VDRL), • Quantitative measurement of antibody to assess clinical syphilis activity or to monitor response \nto therapy (RPR or VDRL) • Confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis in a patient with a reactive RPR or VDRL test (FTA-ABS, \nTPHA, EIA/CIA) Treatment of syphilis is with 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin.",

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette is leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Patients with mild \ndisease may present with flu-like symptoms of sudden onset, fever with chills, headache, \nabdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and myalgia. The muscle pain usually affects the calves, \nabdomen, and back. Mild cases can be treated with oral doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. 333 \nSold by @itachibot Severe leptospirosis is rapidly progressive and is associated with high fatality. The classic \npresentation of the severe disease called Weil’s syndrome includes the triad of hemorrhage, \njaundice, and acute kidney injury. Jaundice when present can be profound and physical \nexamination may reveal an enlarged, tender liver. Temperature-pulse dissociation /relative \nbradycardia can be seen. Moderate to severe cases are treated with intravenous penicillin, \nampicillin, or ceftriaxone. The image below shows icterus and conjunctival suffusion in a patient with leptospirosis. Leptospira are actively motile organisms and are best seen using a dark-field microscope. They are \nthin, tightly coiled, and flexible spirochetes with one end forming a hook. Diagnosis is by \nmicroscopic agglutination test. Transmission occurs through cuts or breaks in the skin and mucous membranes (conjunctival and \noral mucosa). Several outbreaks have been reported that resulted from exposure to floodwaters \ncontaminated by urine from infected animals. The organism enters the bloodstream and lodges in \nthe parenchymatous organs (liver and kidneys) leading to hemorrhage and necrosis of the tissue 334 \nSold by @itachibot causing dysfunction of the organs. The lifecycle of Leptospira is shown below. Illness is classically biphasic after an incubation period of up to 1 month. The stages are: • Acute leptospiremic phase- the organism can be cultured from blood. • Resolving immune phase- the organism can be cultured from urine. The stages may not be clinically distinguishable. Other options: Option A - Chikungunya is a viral disease that presents with saddle-back fever, conjunctival \nsuffusion, and photophobia. Migratory arthralgia, especially involving small joints may also be \nseen. A maculopapular or petechial rash is frequently seen on the trunk. Option C - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a form of severe dengue with bleeding manifestations. \nEvidence of plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia is also generally seen. Option D - Encephalitis due to Hepatitis A is seen in fulminant hepatitis, a rare complication. \nPatients present with confusion, disorientation, ascites, and edema. 335 \nSold by @itachibot General Properties of Viruses",
