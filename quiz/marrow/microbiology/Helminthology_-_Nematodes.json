      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The image shows the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis. The infective form of strongyloides is the filariform larva. Infection occurs through penetration of \nthe skin by larvae in the soil. Then, they migrate to the small intestine. The larvae molt twice and become adult female worms in the small intestine. The eggs laid in the \nmucosa of the intestine hatch immediately releasing the rhabditiform larva (L1 stage). These \nrhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the \ncolonic wall or perianal skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishes \nongoing internal reinfection. The rhabditiform larva can be seen on microscopic examination of stool.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows the egg of Trichuris trichiura (whipworm). The characteristic features of whipworm eggs are: • Eggs are barrel-shaped in the middle with a projecting mucus plug at each pole containing an \nunsegmented ovum. The plugs are colorless. • They float in the saturated salt solution. • It has a triple shell, the outermost layer of which is stained brown. They are commonly transmitted by soil. The eggs passed in the stool are \nunembryonated. Microscopic identification of the eggs in a stool specimen is diagnostic of \nwhipworm infection. In moderate infections of 20 adult worms or less, the worms are confined to the caecum and \nascending colon. The symptoms include epigastric and lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea (rarely \nbloody), vomiting, flatulence and distention, weight loss, and increased blood and iron loss. In heavy infections of 200 adult worms or more (trichuriasis dysentery syndrome), the worms are \nin the distal colon and rectum. The symptoms include bloody diarrhoea with profuse mucus, \nabdominal pain, tenesmus, weight loss leading to cachexia, severe anemia, and rectal prolapse. On \nexamination, clubbing may be present. Blood investigations may show moderate eosinophilia. Chronic infection leads to growth retardation and nutritional deficiencies. Around 0.005 ml of \nblood is lost per day per worm. In heavy infections, as much as 4 to 5 ml can be lost per day per \nworm. Treatment is mebendazole or albendazole.",

      "explanation": "590 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario and muscle biopsy showing larvae are suggestive of trichinellosis. It is \ncaused by Trichinella spiralis. Trichinella spiralis is known as the pork worm since the infection is acquired by consuming raw \nor undercooked pork. The initial infection presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain. In the later \nphase of the infection, the larvae move from the intestines into the circulation and migrate into \nmuscles where they are encysted. This causes symptoms like fever and myalgia. These larvae are calcified in about 5-6 months. Eosinophilia caused by parasitic infection also \ncomes down after 6 months. Detection of spiral larva in muscle tissue is done by performing a muscle biopsy. Deltoid, biceps, \ngastrocnemius, or pectoralis muscles are usually selected for biopsy. Other parasites that can be demonstrated in a muscle biopsy are: • T. solium • T. cruzi (amastigote) The image below shows Trichinella spiralis larvae within the muscle.",

Larva migrans is generally seen when human infection occurs with nonhuman species of \nnematodes. It can be classified into cutaneous or visceral types, depending on whether the larval \nmigration takes place in the skin or in deeper tissues. Visceral larva migrans is caused by the migration of nematode larvae that are acquired via the oral \nroute. Cutaneous larva migrans is caused by the migration of nematode larvae (most \ncommonly Ancylostoma braziliense) that are acquired via skin penetration.

Eggs of both Ancylostoma duodenale (old world hookworm) and Necator americanus (new world \nhookworm) are identical. The hookworm eggs are oval or elliptical in shape, colorless, and non-bile stained. It has a thin \ntransparent hyaline shell membrane. The ovum is segmented with 4 to 8 blastomeres. There is a \nclear space between the segmented ovum and eggshell. Eggs float in the saturated salt solution. Humans are infected when filariform larvae in moist soil penetrate the skin or subcutaneous \ntissue. The larvae are then carried in the venous circulation to the heart and lungs, where they \nmay cause mild transient pneumonitis or bronchitis. They migrate up the respiratory tract to the \npharynx, are swallowed, and reach the small intestine producing epigastric pain, dyspepsia, \nnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A. duodenale or N. americanus ingest blood, secrete anticoagulants, and interfere with the \nabsorption of iron, B12, and folic acid. This leads to iron deficiency anemia and protein-energy \nmalnutrition resulting from blood loss.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a peripheral smear showing sheathed microfilaria with a pointed \ntail free of nuclei is suggestive of Wuchereria bancrofti. The third stage filariform larva is the \ninfective form. Wuchereria bancrofti infection is usually asymptomatic. The symptoms are due to obstruction of \nlymphatics by the filarial stage of adult worms. The lymphatic vessels of the male genitalia are most commonly affected in bancroftian filariasis, \nproducing episodic funiculitis, epididymitis, and orchitis. Adenolymphangitis of the extremities is \nless common. Hydrocele is the most common sign of chronic bancroftian filariasis, followed by lymphedema, \nelephantiasis, and chyluria. The swelling involves the whole leg, the whole arm, the scrotum, the \nvulva, or the breast. DEC provocation test is used to demonstrate microfilaria during the day. The image below shows the life cycle of Wuchereria bancrofti. 597 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows the difference between microfilaria of various filarial nematodes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and image showing sclerosing keratitis are suggestive of onchocerchiasis \n(river blindness). The drug of choice is ivermectin. It is caused by Onchocerca volvulus. It is also known as convoluted filaria or blinding filaria. The vector is blackfly (Simulium species) which breed in fast-flowing rivers, and therefore the \ndisease is most common along the course of rivers. Hence, it is also called river blindness. The usual presentation is formation of a subcutaneous nodule or onchocercoma. It is a firm \nnon-tender nodule arising from bony sites like scalp, elbow, ribs, and iliac crest. It is associated \nwith pruritus and rashes. 598 \nSold by @itachibot The microfilaria in the eyes cause photophobia and gradual loss of vision. The most severe \nmanifestation is sclerosing keratitis and chorioretinitis which causes blindness. It is the 2nd major \ninfective cause of blindness in the world after trachoma. Suramin and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were used earlier but are not used nowadays. DEC \ndestroys microfilariae but usually causes Mazzotti reaction consisting of pruritus, \nrash, lymphadenopathy, fever, hypotension, and occasionally, eye damage. Note: Onchocerciasis is not endemic in India but sporadic cases have been reported from \nNorth-Eastern India.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the image showing Calabar swelling is suggestive of loiasis caused \nby Loa loa. Calabar swellings are temporary foci of inflammation that appear as Loa loa wanders through the \nsubcutaneous tissues. They are up to 3 cm in size and are also called fugitive swellings because \nthey disappear in a few days only to reappear elsewhere. Loa loa is transmitted by the bite of Chrysops species (deerflies). The infective form is the third \nstage microfilaria. After entry into human skin, it grows into an adult worm. The ocular manifestations occur when the worm reaches the subconjunctival tissue during its \nwanderings. They include: • Granuloma in bulbar conjunctiva • Painless edema of the eyelids • Proptosis.
