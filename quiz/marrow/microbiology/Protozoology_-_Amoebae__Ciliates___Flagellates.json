      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given life cycle is of Entamoeba histolytica. Its life cycle includes 2 stages - the motile trophozoite and the non-motile cyst, both of which are \nseen in the image shown above. The transmission is primarily by the fecal-oral route. There is no \nanimal reservoir. The ingested cysts differentiate into trophozoites in the ileum which invade the colonic \nepithelium. The trophozoites penetrate to the submucosal layer and form abscesses which break \ndown to form flask-shaped ulcer. The trophozoites multiply by binary fission and produce cysts, and both stages are passed in the \nfeces. Trophozoites are rapidly destroyed outside the body. Cysts survive in the external \nenvironment and are responsible for transmission. The most frequent site of systemic disease is the liver. Note: The genus Entamoeba has four morphologically identical species - E. histolytica, E. dispar, \nE. bangladeshi, and E. moshkovskii. E. moshkovskii which was initially thought to be \nnon-pathogenic has recently been shown to be a causative agent of non-invasive diarrhea.",

      "explanation": "The most common extraintestinal complication of amoebiasis is hepatic amoebiasis. In intestinal amoebiasis, most of the trophozoites reach the liver. However, only a small portion of \nthem actually lodge and multiply in the liver cells. Patients usually present with an enlarged, \ntender liver without detectable impairment of liver function called amoebic hepatitis. Few patients go on to develop amoebic liver abscess. The center of the abscess contains thick \nchocolate brown pus (anchovy sauce pus), which is made up of liquefied necrotic liver tissue. It is \nbacteriologically sterile and free of amoeba. The periphery is made up of nearly normal liver tissue \ncontaining invading amoeba. Complications and sequelae of intestinal amoebiasis: • Fulminant amoebic colitis • Toxic megacolon • Perianal ulceration • Amoeboma • Extraintestinal amoebiasis • Hepatic amoebiasis (most common)- Amoebic hepatitis and Amoebic liver abscess • Amoebic appendicitis and peritonitis • Pulmonary amoebiasis • Cerebral amoebiasis • Splenic abscess • Cutaneous amoebiasis • Genitourinary amoebiasis 521 \nSold by @itachibot",

Giardia lamblia, also called Giardia duodenalis, is the causative agent of giardiasis. It is the only \ncommon pathogenic protozoan found in the duodenum and jejunum of humans. Infection occurs by the ingestion of mature cysts in contaminated water and food and \nis transmitted by the faeco-oral route. 525 \nSold by @itachibot It is weakly pathogenic in humans. Secretory IgA and IL-6 are responsible for clearing the \ninfection. Hence, giardiasis usually occurs in immunosuppressed, agammaglobulinemic, or \nmalnourished individuals. Clinical features: • Diarrhea • Fat malabsorption • Dull epigastric pain • Belching and flatulence • Iron deficiency and growth stunting. • Stool will have excess mucus and fat but no blood. Detection of antigen by ELISA is more sensitive and specific than microscopy. Entero test is also \nused in the diagnosis. Histopathology of the duodenum reveals several heart-shaped or pear-shaped trophozoites with \ntwo equally sized nuclei. The small intestinal morphology is usually normal. However, in heavy \ninfections, there may be villous blunting and intraepithelial infiltrates. Metronidazole/tinidazole/nitazoxanide are the first-line agents in the treatment.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given life cycle belongs to Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi is the causative organism of Chagas disease or South American trypanosomiasis. They are \nintracellular parasites. It passes its life cycle in two hosts- the definitive host is the man and the intermediate host \n(vector) is reduviid bug or triatomine bugs. Metacyclic trypomastigotes are the infective forms to the man that are found in feces of reduviid \nbugs. Transmission occurs when mucus membranes, conjunctiva, or wound on the surface of the \nskin are contaminated by feces of the bug. Inside the definitive host, the trypomastigotes differentiate into intracellular amastigotes. The \namastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then \nreleased into the bloodstream. These are the infective stage for triatomine bug. No multiplication \noccurs in this stage. Inside the triatomine bug, the trypomastigotes are transformed into epimastigotes and then \ninto metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut which are excreted in feces. 530 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Amastigote forms resemble the Leishmania spp. and hence they are frequently known as \nLeishmanial forms. They are found in muscular tissue, nervous tissue, and reticuloendothelial \nsystem.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given life cycle belongs to Leishmania donovani. The definitive hosts are man, dog, and other mammals and the vector/intermediate host is female \nsandfly. Promastigotes are infective forms to man. L. donovani exists in 2 forms: • Amastigote form- in humans and other mammals • Promastigote form- in the sandfly and artificial culture When the infected sandfly bites a person, infectious promastigotes are released into the host \ndermis along with the sandfly saliva, which potentiates parasite infectivity. Amastigote form (as shown in the image below) is also known as Leishman-Donovan (LD) body. It \nis an intracellular form found inside macrophages, monocytes and reticuloendothelial cells. It \ncontains a kinetoplast which consists of a parabasal body and a blepharoplast. Flagellum is \nabsent. Promastigote form (as shown in the below image) is present in the midgut of the female sandfly. \nThe kinetoplast lies transversely near the anterior end. A single flagellum is seen. It is the \ninfective form of Leishmania donovani for humans. 531 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given image shows bone marrow aspiration and it is most commonly done to diagnose \nKala-azar. The microscopic demonstration of amastigotes from bone marrow is the gold standard for the \ndiagnosis of Kala-azar Generally, the sternal marrow is aspirated by puncturing the sternum at the level of the 2nd or \n3rd intercostal space, using a sternal puncture needle. Other samples collected are peripheral blood, splenic aspirate, and enlarged lymph node. In kala-azar: • Most common specimen collected for microscopy- bone marrow aspirate. • Most sensitive method- splenic aspirate. Option B: Schistosomiasis is typically diagnosed by stool examination for parasite eggs. Option C: Toxoplasmosis is usually diagnosed based on serologic testing. Option D: Chagas disease is diagnosed by peripheral blood smear examination, culture and \nexamination of aspirates from lymph nodes and chagoma.",
