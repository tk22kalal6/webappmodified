      "explanation": "Influenza virus has an 8 segmented genome. Its site of replication is the nucleus, unlike other \nRNA viruses. Influenza virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, except pox. Most RNA viruses replicate in the \ncytoplasm, except retroviruses and orthomyxoviruses. Examples of segmented viruses (ARBO): • Arenavirus (2 segments) • Rotavirus (11 segments) • Bunyavirus (3 segments) • Orthomyxovirus (8 segments) The image below shows the segmented genome seen in the influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae)",

Influenza virus contains two surface antigens: • Hemagglutinin (HA) - causes RBC agglutination; facilitates viral entry into cells • Neuraminidase (NA) - an enzyme that destroys the receptor HA uses to bind to RBCs causing \nelution/reversal of hemagglutination. Hence, it is also called a receptor destroying enzyme (RDE).",

It \ninfects neurons primarily, but may rarely infect astrocytes. • Centrifugal spread - After CNS infection is established, it spreads along the sensory and \nautonomic nerves to: • Salivary glands • Adrenal glands • Skin Rabies virus replicates in acinar cells of the salivary glands and is secreted in the saliva of rabid \nanimals that serve as vectors.",
