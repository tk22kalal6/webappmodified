      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "494 \nSold by @itachibot Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) infecting a human is an example of an aberrant parasite. It is \ndefined as a parasite that infects a host where they cannot develop further. Parasites can be classified as: • Ectoparasites - inhabit only the body surface of the host without penetrating the tissue. The term \ninfestation is often used for parasitization. e.g., lice, ticks, and mites. • Endoparasite - lives within the body of the host and causes infection. Endoparasites are further classified as follows: • Obligate parasites - cannot exist without a host. e.g., Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium. • Facultative parasites - exist as either parasitic or free-living forms. e.g., Naegleria fowleri. • Accidental parasites - infects an unusual host. e.g., Echinococcus granulosus infects man • Aberrant/Wandering parasites - infects a host where they cannot develop further. e.g., Toxocara \ncanis (dog roundworm) infecting humans.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A host in which the larval stage of the parasite remains viable without further development is \nreferred to as the paratenic host. For example, in the lifecycle of Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm), humans are the \ndefinitive host. The first intermediate host is cyclops and the second is small freshwater fish. If the \nsmall freshwater fish with the plerocercoid larva get eaten by a larger fish, the larva survives in the \nlarger fish. This makes the larger fish a paratenic host. Host is an organism that harbors the parasite and provides nourishment and shelter to it. It is \nrelatively larger than the parasite. Types of hosts: • Definitive host - harbors stages of sexual reproduction of the parasite. • Intermediate host - harbors stages of asexual multiplication of the parasite. • Paratenic host - harbors only the larval stage of the parasite which remains viable without \nfurther development. • Reservoir host - harbors the parasite and acts as an important source of infection to other \nsusceptible hosts, especially in endemic areas. • Accidental host - harbors a parasite that is not usually found in the host.",
