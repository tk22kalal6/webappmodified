      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of necrotizing fasciitis which is most commonly \ncaused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A -hemolytic streptococcus). Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive inflammatory infection of the fascia, with secondary \nnecrosis of the subcutaneous tissues. It has also been referred to as Meleney ulcer, acute dermal \ngangrene, hospital gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis. The \nsource of the infection is either the skin, with organisms introduced into the tissue through \ntrauma, or the bowel flora, with organisms released during abdominal surgery. The onset of symptoms is usually quite acute and is marked by severe pain at the site of \ninvolvement, malaise, fever, chills, and a toxic appearance. The affected limb is edematous with \nthe overlying skin turning dusky with mottled erythema and the development of hemorrhagic \nbullae. This is a surgical emergency as the condition is rapidly fatal. Treatment of the condition includes: • Surgical intervention is the major therapeutic modality in cases of necrotizing fasciitis. • Antibiotics- penicillin (1-4 million U IV q4h) plus clindamycin (600-900 mg IV q8h).
