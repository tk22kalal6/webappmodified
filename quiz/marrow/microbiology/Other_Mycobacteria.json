M. scrofulaceum is a scotochromogen which produces yellow or orange colored pigments, even in \nthe dark. It belongs to group II of Runyon's classification. It can cause scrofula or cervical adenitis \nin children. M.ulcerans, M.avium intracellulare complex (MAC), and M. xenopi belong to group III-non \nphotochromogens as they do not form pigment even on exposure to light.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The species of mycobacteria being studied here is Mycobacterium bovis. It forms moist, smooth, \nflat, white colonies on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media that break-up easily when touched. Mycobacterium bovis belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. It causes \ntuberculosis-like disease in humans. Lowenstein–Jensen medium is a commonly used, egg-based, selective media for mycobacteria. It \ncontains: • Egg- Provides fatty acids and protein required for metabolism • Malachite green- Prevents the growth of contaminants. Makes it a selective medium. • Mineral salt solution- Buffer • Glycerol- Source of carbon, favors growth of M. tuberculosis, but not M. bovis. LJ medium \nwithout glycerol, which contains pyruvate, is used for culture of M. bovis. • L-asparagine- Nitrogen source The image below shows M.bovis colonies on LJ media. Mycobacterium tuberculosis colonies on LJ medium are dry, rough, raised and irregular with a \nwrinkled surface. They are creamy white or buff-colored, tenacious and difficult to \nemulsify(rough, tough, buff). 183 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "184 \nSold by @itachibot Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer. M. ulcerans produces a toxin called mycolactone which leads to formation of Buruli ulcer. This is \na chronic, debilitating, necrotizing disease of the skin and soft tissue which is characterized by the \nformation of ulcers that progressively enlarge over time if left untreated. The ulcers heal with \ndisfiguring scars. The image below shows a Buruli ulcer. Option A: Hunner's ulcers are seen in a subset of patients with interstitial cystitis.

M. marinarum is a natural pathogen of fish and amphibians, which spreads to humans who \ncome in contact with contaminated swimming pools or fish tanks.

Thus, 5% sulphuric acid (option A) is used \nfor decolourisation to demonstrate M.leprae's acid-fastness. On microscopy, the bacilli appear \nbound together in masses called globi, within which they are arranged in a 'cigar bundle' \nappearance. For leprosy diagnosis, specimens are collected from the nasal mucosa, skin lesions and earlobes. \nNasal smears are collected from the internal septum of the nose. Skin smears are collected from \nthe edges of the lesions (option B) rather than from the centre. Slit skin smears are taken as well. \nThe skin is pinched up tight to minimise bleeding and a cut is made with a scalpel, deep enough to \nget into the infiltrated layers.
