      "explanation": "The coronavirus spike protein binds to the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors to enter the human \ncells. Coronaviruses are a group of spherical or pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses having club or \npetal-shaped peplomers. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. It spreads through coughing, sneezing, and close personal contact such as touching the mouth, \nnose. The virus is highly mutable and so vaccine prophylaxis for all strains is difficult. Coronaviruses cause upper respiratory tract infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), \nand Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). They spread by inhalation of the virus present \nin droplets or aerosols of respiratory secretions of the patients. Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus: (SARS-CoV-2) • Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. • Maintain social distancing- Maintain at least 1 meter distance between yourself and anyone who \nis coughing or sneezing • Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth • Practice respiratory hygiene- cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when \nyou cough or sneeze, then dispose of the used tissue immediately. • If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early • Stay informed and follow the advice given by your healthcare provider 442 \nSold by @itachibot",

FELUDA (FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay) is a newly approved method based on \nCRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of SARS-CoV2. The CRISPR technology uses a highly specific CAS9 protein to find and bind to the target Covid \nsignature. This is then coupled with paper-strip chemistry to elicit a visual readout on a paper \nstrip.
