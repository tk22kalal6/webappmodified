      "question": "Question 1: While assessing the quality of drinking water in a village, you detect the presence of coliform \nbacilli by the multiple tube technique. Following this, you decide to perform the Eijkman test. \nWhat is this test also known as?",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Eijkman test is also known as differential coliform test. Drinking water should be free of any pathogenic microorganisms. The presence of coliform \nbacteria in the water may indicate faecal pollution, while the detection of E.coli confirms it. The presumptive coliform test is done by the multiple tube technique. Following this, the Eijkman \ntest is done to confirm the presence of E. coli. They can grow at 44°C (faecal thermotolerant \nbacilli), ferment lactose and cause indole and gas production. Option A: Presumptive coliform count detects the probable number of coliform bacilli in water. It \ncan be positive due to the presence of organisms other than E.coli also. Option C: Colony counts provide an estimate of the general bacterial purity of water. Option D: Methylene blue reduction test is used to assess the bacterial contamination of milk.",

      "explanation": "Recent fecal contamination of water is suggested by the presence of enterococcus (fecal \nstreptococci). Clostridium perfringens may be present for a long duration. If it is present in water, it suggests \nthat contamination is not recent. If Escherichia coli is detected, it is definitive proof of fecal contamination. However, it is \nnon-specific for suggesting the duration of the contamination.",

      "explanation": "Pasteurization is not used for the bacteriological examination of milk. Pasteurization is the process of applying heat, to milk, for a specified period for the purpose of \nkilling pathogenic bacteria. There are two methods: holder method and flash method. Option A: Methylene blue reduction test depends on the reduction of methylene blue by bacteria \nin milk when incubated at 37 °C in complete darkness. Option B: Resazurin test is similar to methylene blue reduction test, but the dye resazurin on \nreduction passes through a series of colour changes from blue to pink to colourless. The shade of \ncolour after incubation with milk for a particular period of time depends on the degree of \ncontamination. 608 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Phosphatase test is used to check whether milk has been pasteurised.

      "explanation": "Aminopterin is a folate antagonist present in the HAT medium that inhibits the de novo pathway \nof nucleotide synthesis.

Hybridomas are somatic cell hybrids produced by fusing the antibody-forming spleen cells with \nmyeloma cells.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The disc diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility testing is applied in the Kirby-Bauer \nmethod. To perform Kirby-Bauer’s disc diffusion method, a suitable standard dilution of a broth culture of \nthe test bacterium is inoculated on the surface of a solid medium (Cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton \nagar) as a lawn culture. After drying, various antibiotic discs are placed on its surface. Zones of \ninhibition around the disc are recorded and interpreted according to the zone diameters available \nin the tables of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The results \nobtained are qualitative (resistant, sensitive, or partially sensitive). Laboratory testing for antibiotic sensitivity can be done by: • Diffusion method- Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, Stokes disc diffusion method • Dilution method- broth dilution method, agar dilution method • Combination of diffusion and dilution method- E–test (Epsilometer) The image below shows Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. 611 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to quantify the PCR by monitoring the \namplification process while the PCR is ongoing. Types of PCR: • Reverse transcriptase PCR- The enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to synthesize a \ncomplementary copy of DNA (cDNA) from RNA and this cDNA is then used as a template for \nPCR. • Real-time PCR- This helps quantify the PCR and gives an estimate of the pathogen DNA load in \nthe specimen. It uses fluorescent dyes or specific DNA probes. It is also known as qPCR \n(Quantitative PCR) • Multiplex PCR- Primers to more than one pathogen are used simultaneously and hence multiple \nproducts are obtained. 612 \nSold by @itachibot • Nested PCR- It involves the sequential use of two primer sets. The first primer set is used for \namplification and the amplicon obtained is then used as a target sequence for second \namplification. This ensures specificity.",

When antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of red blood cells, the resultant clumping \nreaction is referred to as hemagglutination. It is routinely performed to type red blood cells in \nABO blood-typing. The image below shows hemagglutination. In ELISA, radioimmunoassay and immunofluorescence, the antigens or antibodies are labeled or \nmarked with enzymes, fluorescent dyes, etc. Note: If no hemagglutination occurs it means the patient’s serum has anti-haemagglutinin \nantibodies that bind to hemagglutinin and prevent the clumping reaction.
