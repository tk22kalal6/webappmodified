They possess polymetaphosphate granules that serve as storage granules and are \ncalled metachromatic granules. These give the bacilli a beaded or club-shaped appearance on \nmicroscopic examination. 136 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Gram-negative diplococci describes Neisseria menigitidis and N. gonorrhoeae.

The selective media for Corynebacterium diphtheria are potassium tellurite agar, Tinsdale \nmedium and McLeod's medium (tellurite blood agar). Tellurite inhibits the growth of other \nbacteria. C. diphtheria reduces the tellurite to metallic tellurium, giving its colonies a grey black \ncolour.

A bacteriophage is a virus that parasitises bacteria. It can carry host DNA and transfer it to \nanother bacterium.

Concentration of zinc in the medium has no \neffect on this process. An increase in iron concentration (option A) upregulates the DT (diphtheria toxin) repressor gene, \nthereby decreasing the toxin production. The optimum level of iron in the medium for toxin \nproduction is 0.14 g/millilitre, while a concentration of 0.5 g/millilitre inhibits the formation of \ntoxins. The gene for diphtheria toxin is coded by bacteriophage (corynebacteriophage tox+) and thus the \npresence of phages (option B) is integral to toxin production. Toxin production also depends on \nthe biotype (option C) - gravis, intermedius, mitis and belfanti - of the bacilli. All four biotypes are \ntoxigenic.

Elek's gel precipitation test is an in vitro immunoprecipitation (immunodiffusion) test used to \ndetermine whether or not a strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae is toxigenic. In this test, a \nrectangular strip of filter paper impregnated with diphtheria antitoxin is placed on the surface of a \n20% normal horse serum agar. Narrow streaks of the C. diphtheriae strains are made at right \nangles to the filter paper strip with positive and negative controls. If the strain produces toxins, \nthe toxin will diffuse in the agar and produce a line of precipitation (arrowhead) where it meets \nthe antitoxin at optimum concentration. The test is shown in the image below. Option A: For checking susceptibility to diphtheria, Schick test is used. Option B: The biotype of diphtheria can be determined based on colony morphology and \nbiochemical reactions.

Surgical excision and \ndrainage may be required in some cases. The given image shows cervicofacial actinomycosis.

      "explanation": "The most common clinical form of actinomycosis is cervicofacial. Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection characterized by indurated swellings, mainly \nin the connective tissue, suppuration, and discharge of sulphur granules. The most common \ncausative agent is Actinomycetes israelli. Various clinical forms of actinomycosis involves cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic \nactinomycosis. Among them, actinomycosis most frequently occurs as oral-cervicofacial form \npresenting as a soft tissue swelling, abscess, or mass lesion involving the angle of jaw. 146 \nSold by @itachibot Clostridium and Bacillus",
