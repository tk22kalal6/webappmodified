      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "This patient has a high-grade fever and is a student, so he presumably spends a lot of time in \ncrowded areas. The above image shows a purpuric rash. This patient's features are seen in \nmeningococcemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which are gram-negative diplococci. The organism enters the body through the nasopharynx by attaching to the epithelial cells with \nthe help of pili. From the nasopharynx, they enter the bloodstream producing bacteremia, and the \nsymptoms may resemble upper respiratory tract infection. Fulminant meningococcemia is the severe form, where the patient presents with high-grade fever \nand hemorrhagic rash. There is thrombosis of several small blood vessels in various organs with \nperivascular infiltration and petechial hemorrhages. Some patients with fulminant \nmeningococcemia may also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, and circulatory \ncollapse, a condition known as Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome.",

Hence, a nasopharyngeal swab is used in the detection of \ncarriers. In some patients, local inflammation ensues with rhinitis and pharyngitis. Ceftriaxone as a single-dose IV/IM injection is highly (97%) effective in the eradication of carrier \nstate and can be used at all ages and also in pregnancy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Polysaccharide vaccines of Neisseria meningitidis do not offer protection against group B \nmeningococci. This is because the group B capsule is made up of sialic acid residue which is also \nexpressed on the surface of neural cells in the fetus. So, the B polysaccharide is perceived as 'self' \nand is poorly immunogenic. To overcome this issue and provide protection against group B meningococci, a new vaccine was \ndeveloped based on the surface protein i.e., non-capsular antigen of serogroup B meningococci. \nThis is the multicomponent meningococcal vaccine - 4CMenB. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines developed based on capsular antigen can be classified as: • Plain polysaccharide vaccines: • Bivalent (A and C), • Trivalent (A, C and W-135) • Tetravalent (A, C, Y, and W-135) • Conjugated polysaccharide vaccines: • Monovalent (A or C) • Quadrivalent (A, C, Y, and W-135) MenQuadfi vaccine",

Third-generation cephalosporins such as \nceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime are used empirically for the initiation of treatment for \nsuspected meningococcal meningitis. These drugs are administered as they also cover the various other potentially penicillin-resistant \nbacteria that may produce clinical features similar to that of meningococcal meningitis like \npenicillin-resistant pneumococcus. Also, some instances of reduced meningococcal sensitivity to \npenicillin have also been reported. Both meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia are conventionally treated for 7 \ndays, although courses of 3–5 days may be equally effective. Rifampicin can be used for \nprophylaxis for close contacts. Ceftriaxone can also be used for chemoprophylaxis, especially in \npregnant individuals.

Neisseria is not an obligate intracellular organism, it can also occur \nextracellularly i.e, it is a facultative intracellular organism. The other neisseria that are found as \nnormal inhabitants of the human respiratory tract occur extracellularly. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative, non-sporulating, non-motile diplococcus that \nis aerobic but may grow anaerobically also. It is oxidase and catalase-positive. Although Neisseria are non-motile organisms, they show twitching motility. This is a \nflagella-independent form of bacterial translocation over moist surfaces that occurs by the \nextension and retraction of polar type IV pili. These pili act as virulence factors by promoting \nattachment to host cells and inhibiting phagocytosis. Virulence factors for gonococci: • Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) • IgA proteases • Pili • Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) • Transferrin • Lactoferrin-binding protein",

The vaginal mucosa is not usually affected in \nadults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci, and also \nbecause of the acidic pH of vaginal secretions.
