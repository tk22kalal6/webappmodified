The clinical features of neurocysticercosis include: • Epilepsy • Increased intracranial tension • Hydrocephalus • Psychiatric disturbances • Meningoencephalitis • Transient paresis • Behavioral disorders • Aphasia 564 \nSold by @itachibot • Visual disturbances. The CT and MRI findings seen in neurocysticercosis are: • Scolex within a cyst • Cystic lesions with or without ring enhancement • Nodular calcifications • Focal enhancing lesions • Multilobulated cystic lesions in the subarachnoid space. Note: About 70% of adult-onset epilepsy is due to neurocysticercosis. Albendazole is the drug of choice for neurocysticercosis.

It is caused \nby Echinococcus granulosus. 566 \nSold by @itachibot The water-lily sign occurs due to detachment of the endocyst membrane from the cyst wall giving \nthe apparance of floating membranes within the pericyst.

The transmission to humans occurs by eating raw or \nundercooked crab or crayfish containing metacercariae. The metacercariae excyst in the human \ngut and young worms migrate to the lungs, where they become encapsulated in lung tissue. The patient complains of cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. The viscous sputum is speckled with \ngolden-brown eggs. Praziquantel (25 mg/ kg TDS for 1-2 days) is the drug of choice. 574 \nSold by @itachibot Helminthology - Nematodes",
