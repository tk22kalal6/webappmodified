The B subunit binds to globotriaosylceramide receptors on the target cell, and then, the A \nsubunit gets internalized. The A subunit leads to inhibition of 60S ribosome, leading to shut down \nof protein synthesis. Its site of action is in the endothelial cells of small blood vessels of GIT.",

The combination of this with fever, splenomegaly, presence of \nlongitudinal ulcers in the intestine and intestinal perforation is suggestive of enteric fever. The term enteric fever includes typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphoid fever \ncaused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. Enteric fever presents with step ladder pyrexia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The tube agglutination test which is widely used for the diagnosis of enteric fever is the Widal test. \nThe O antibodies detected via this test disappear within a few weeks of disease resolution and so \nare indicative of recent infection. Widal test is a serological test for the measurement of O and H antigens of Salmonella typhi and \nSalmonella paratyphi present in the patient's serum. Four antigens are used- O antigens of S. \ntyphi (TO), H antigens of S. typhi (TH), H antigens of S. paratyphi A (AH) and H antigens of S. \nparatyphi B (BH). Paratyphoid O antigens cross-reacts with the typhoid O antigen due to the sharing of factor 12. It \nis not used in the test and thus, O antibody cannot differentiate between Salmonella types. H agglutinin titer &gt; 160 and O agglutinin titer &gt; 80 is considered significant. However, \na 4-fold rise in titers between 1st and 3rd week is more significant compared to a single high titer \nbecause of the possibility of an anamnestic reaction - a transient rise of titer due to unrelated \ninfections (malaria, dengue) in persons who had a prior enteric fever. After one week interval, if \nthe titer increases, it indicates true infection. If the titer decreases, it indicates an anamnestic \nreaction.",

Enteric fever, caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C, presents with step \nladder pyrexia. The fever rises one day and falls the subsequent morning.

Hence, it is \npreferred in the patient above who has been on antibiotics for 2 days. Blood culture has a sensitivity of about 60% for diagnosis of enteric fever.
