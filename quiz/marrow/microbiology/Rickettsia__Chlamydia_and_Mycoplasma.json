      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. A cell wall is present in rickettsial \norganisms. Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular, gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli. They are unable to \ngrow in cell-free media and are thus cultured in yolk sacs of embryonated eggs. They are \nnon-motile, non-capsulated organisms that contain both DNA and RNA. They reproduce by \nbinary fission and are transmitted by arthropods like ticks and lice (except Coxiella burnetii and \nBartonella henselae). The rickettsiae are localized in endothelial cells of small blood vessels (except Ehrlichia and \nAnaplasma) in humans. They cause endothelial cell enlargement and degeneration, predisposing 307 \nSold by @itachibot to thrombus formation. Tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are effective against this \ngroup but, beta-lactams are ineffective.",

      "explanation": "The vector for endemic murine typhus is the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. Endemic murine typhus is cuased by Rickettsia typhi (option B) while epidemic typhus is caused \nby Rickettsia prowazekii. The zoonotic reservoir for R. typhi is the rat. Humans are infected \nwhen flea feces contaminate pruritic bite lesions. Transmission can also occur via inhalation of \naerosols of dried feces of rickettsemic rat flea. No man-to-man transmission occurs. Patients \npresent with fever, chills, vomiting and a maculopapular rash that is more prominent on the \ntrunk. Diagnosis is by serology and treatment is with doxycycline. When male guinea pigs are inoculated intraperitoneally with blood from a case of endemic typhus, \nthey develop fever and a characteristic scrotal inflammation.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Epidemic typhus rash spares the palms and soles. Epidemic typhus, caused by Rickettsia prowazekii, is transmitted by the louse Pediculus humanus \ncorporis. There is no transovarial transmission of R. prowazekii. The disease spreads through \ninfected louse feces deposited when the louse feeds on the human host. It is commonly seen in \npoor unhygienic or cold conditions. Epidemic typhus starts with fever and chills. A characteristic rash appears on the fourth or fifth \nday, starting on the trunk and spreading over the limbs but sparing the face, palms, and soles. In \nsome patients who recover from epidemic typhus, the rickettsiae may remain latent in the \nlymphoid tissues or organs for years. Such latent infection may, at times, be reactivated leading to \nrecrudescent typhus (Brill-Zinsser disease). Transovarial transmission refers to passing on the disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod \nto offspring arthropod. It occurs with Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia rickettsii, R. conorii and \nR. akari.

In the case of \npregnant women, oral azithromycin 500 mg for 3 days may be used as doxycycline is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy. Scrub typhus is a rickettsial infection caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. The vector is a \ntrombiculid mite. Humans are infected when they are bitten by the mite larvae known as chiggers. \nThe incubation period is 1- 3 weeks. Patients develop a characteristic eschar at the site of the mite \nbite, along with regional lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash. It can be associated with \nfever, headache, myalgia, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia. Serologic assays are used for diagnosis. Weil-Felix reaction is a heterophile agglutination reaction \nused for diagnosis, wherein the sera are tested for agglutinins to the O antigens of Proteus strains \nOX19, OX2, and OXK.
