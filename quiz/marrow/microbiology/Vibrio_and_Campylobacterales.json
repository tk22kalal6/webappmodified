Zonula occludens toxin (Zot) is an enterotoxin elaborated by Vibrio cholerae that increases \nintestinal permeability by interacting with a mammalian cell receptor with subsequent activation \nof intracellular signaling leading to the disassembly of the intercellular tight junctions. Mechanism of action of cholera toxin: • The cholera toxin molecule consists of 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B (binding) units attach to the \nGM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A (active) subunit, \non being transported into the enterocyte, dissociates into A1 and A2. A2 fragment only links \nbiologically active A1 to the B subunit. • A1 causes prolonged activation of cellular adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, leading \nto outpouring into the small intestinal lumen, of large quantities of water and electrolytes. This \nleads to watery diarrhea which is isotonic with plasma but contains much more potassium and \nbicarbonate. • The toxin also inhibits the intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride. • All clinical manifestations and complications in cholera result from the massive water and \nelectrolyte depletion thus caused.",
