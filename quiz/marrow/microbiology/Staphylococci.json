On nutrient agar, its colonies are large (2-4 mm \nin diameter), convex, smooth, shiny, opaque and easily emulsifiable. The colonies appear golden \nyellow due to the presence of staphyloxanthin (carotenoid). Pigment production occurs optimally \nat 22°C and in aerobic conditions. It is enhanced when 1% glycerol or milk is incorporated in the \nmedium. On a nutrient agar slope, there is confluent growth of Staphylococcus, which appears as a \ncharacteristic oil-paint appearance. 121 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "123 \nSold by @itachibot Penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is determined by plasmids that are most commonly \ntransferred by transduction. Penicillin resistance in Staphylococci most commonly occurs due to bacterial production of \nbeta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins by splitting their beta-lactam ring. These enzymes \nare inducible and are plasmid-mediated. They confer resistance to penicillin G, ampicillin, \npiperacillin etc. The genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance can occur in the following ways: • Transformation: After death or cell lysis, some bacteria release their DNA into the environment. \nOther bacteria, generally of the same species, can come into contact with these free DNA \nfragments, take them up and incorporate them into their DNA by recombination. • Transduction: This method involves the transfer of DNA, episome or plasmid from one \nbacterium to another with the use of a bacteriophage. • Conjugation: This mechanism requires the presence of a special plasmid called the F plasmid \nthat codes for the sex pilus. It is the most common method of transfer of antibiotic resistance in \nmost other bacteria. Note: Change in penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and production of -lactamases are modes of \npenicillin resistance seen in S. aureus but the question asks for methods of transfer of drug \nresistance.",

In addition to this, personnel with active S. aureus lesions and carriers should be excluded from \nareas having patients at highest risk for severe staphylococcal infections like newborn nurseries, \nintensive care units, operating rooms, and cancer chemotherapy wards. In such individuals, the \napplication of topical antiseptics such as mupirocin to nasal or perineal carriage sites may \ndiminish the shedding of MRSA. 124 \nSold by @itachibot",
