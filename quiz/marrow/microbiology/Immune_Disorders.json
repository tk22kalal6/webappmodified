      "explanation": "DiGeorge syndrome is not a disorder of phagocytosis. It is due to a developmental defect involving the endodermal derivatives of the 3rd and 4th \npharyngeal pouches. Cell-mediated immunity is defective due to decreased T-cells. Affected \nindividuals also have depressed graft rejection, hypocalcemia, and cardiac defects. 87 \nSold by @itachibot Disorders of phagocytosis: • Leukocyte adhesion deficiency • Chediak–Higashi syndrome • Chronic granulomatous disease • Tuftsin deficiency • Cyclic neutropenia Other options: Option B: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency leads to defective neutrophil migration to sites of \ninfection, peripheral neutrophilia, and recurrent infections without pus. Option C: Chediak–Higashi syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder due to defects in \nlysosomal transport protein (LYST), leading to defective microtubule polymerization and defective \nphagolysosome formation. There is neutropenia and recurrent infections. Option D: Chronic granulomatous disease is due to a defect in NADPH oxidase resulting in the \nabsence of respiratory burst. It presents with recurrent infections with catalase-positive microbes.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "X- linked or Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is primarily a disease of humoral immunity. \nCell-mediated immunity is not affected. It is an inherited immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton \ntyrosine kinase (BTK). B cells do not differentiate and mature. They are arrested in the pre-B cell \nstage. There are extremely low IgG levels (below 100 mg/dL) and an absence of other immunoglobulin \nclasses. The tonsils and lymph nodes are usually atrophic. Lymph node biopsy reveals depletion of \ncells of B cell-dependent areas (follicles). Babies born with this disorder have virtually no \nperipheral B cells (&lt;1%) and suffer from recurrent bacterial infections.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The Nitroblue Tetrazolium Test (NBT) is used as a screening test for chronic granulomatous \ndisease (CGD) by assessing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in phagocytes. This principle relies on the color change of nitroblue tetrazolium, which transforms from \ncolorless/yellow to deep blue when it encounters ROS. A higher nitroblue test score indicates that \nthe cell is more efficient in producing ROS. In chronic granulomatous disease, there is an NADPH oxidase defect. Hence, the phagocyte \ncannot produce reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing, which results in \nrecurrent infections. Here, the leukocytes fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. \nHence, a negative test (NBT remains colourless to yellow) is seen in CGD. A positive test result means neutrophils turn blue, as shown below: 88 \nSold by @itachibot A negative test means nitroblue tetrazolium remains colourless/yellow, as shown below:",

      "explanation": "The history here is highly suggestive of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), a condition \ncharacterized by decreased IgM levels. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder. It is caused \nby mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) that primarily affects the T \nlymphocytes. Normally, WASp regulates the actin cytoskeleton and thus helps in cell adhesion, \nmigration, and the formation of synapses between antigen-presenting and target cells. In WAS, \nthere is a progressive loss of T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood resulting in defects in cellular \nimmunity. 89 \nSold by @itachibot The clinical features of WAS are a triad of recurrent bacterial infections, eczema, and bleeding due \nto thrombocytopenia (with small platelets). Diagnosis is based on intracellular \nimmunofluorescence analysis of WAS protein (WASp) expression in blood cells. IgM levels in the \nserum are low, but levels of IgG are usually normal.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A child with multiple abscesses (as shown in the image above) with a history of atopy and \nrecurrent respiratory infections suggests immunodeficiency, and the most probable diagnosis is \nHyper IgE syndrome. The hyper-IgE syndromes are rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by \nrecurrent severe staphylococcal abscesses of the skin, lungs, and other sites, eczema, eosinophilia, \nand marked elevation of serum IgE levels. They occur in 2 forms: • Autosomal dominant - involves mutations in the gene encoding STAT-3 (also known as Job \nsyndrome) • Autosomal recessive - involves mutations in DOCK8. In Job syndrome, mutation of the STAT3 gene leads to IgE overproduction without modulation. \nLoss of modulation is due to the absence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and \nIFN-gamma. Lack of IL-6 leads to deficiency of CD4 + Th17 cells, making them susceptible to \nvarious infections. It usually presents as a triad of atopic dermatitis, recurrent skin staphylococcal infections, and \nrecurrent pulmonary infections that occur early in childhood. The eczematoid rash affects the \nscalp and face, gets superinfected with Staphylococcus aureus and forms cold abscesses. Candida \ninfections are common. Recurrent staphylococcal pneumonia with pneumatocoeles is also 90 \nSold by @itachibot commonly seen. Other non-immunological features are: • Dysmorphic facial features that appear in early adolescence and are absent in the autosomal \nrecessive form • Craniosynostosis • Arnold-Chiari type 1 • Hyperextensible joints • Scoliosis • Pathological fractures • Retention of primary teeth • Vascular complications • Ocular complications Diagnosis is based on measurements of serum IgE levels &gt;2000U/mL where IgA, IgG and IgM \nconcentrations are generally normal, in adjunct with the clinical features seen in Job syndrome. It \nis associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. The treatment primarily focuses on preventing infections through the use of antimicrobials, \nincluding antibiotics and antifungals, along with immunoglobulin replacement therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Louis–Bar syndrome or ataxia-telangiectasia is a combined immunodeficiency disorder. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a syndrome complex that comprises neurologic, immunologic, \nendocrinologic, and cutaneous disorders. The gene involved in this condition is the mutation in \nthe ATM gene mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11(11q22-23). The mode of inheritance is \nautosomal recessive. There is defective DNA repair and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Clinical features: • Progressive cerebellar ataxia • Oculocutaneous telangiectasias • Chronic sinopulmonary disease • High incidence of malignancy - adenocarcinomas and lymphoreticular tumors (lymphoma, \nleukemia, and Hodgkin's disease) • Humoral and cellular immunodeficiency • Ovarian dysgenesis and chromosomal abnormalities • Hypoplastic thymus • Ataxia and chorioathetoid movements start in infancy. The onset of telangiectasia is around 3 to 6 years and involves the face, conjunctiva and other \nparts of the body. By 12 years of age, affected children are usually confined to wheelchairs due to \nprogressive ataxia. 91 \nSold by @itachibot Death occurs due to sinopulmonary infection in early life or due to malignancy in the second or \nthird decade. They lack IgA and IgE. Cell-mediated immunity is also defective. The image below shows ocular telangiectasia in a patient with A-T.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history of recurrent bacterial infections and fungal pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis \njirovecii (as shown in the image above), along with elevated IgM and low IgG levels, are suggestive \nof hyper-IgM syndrome, an inherited deficiency in the CD40 ligand or CD40. Hyper-IgM syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that is inherited as: • X-linked form (most common): CD40 ligand (CD40L) defect on T-helper cells, preventing B-cell \nactivation, class switching and memory cells formation. • Autosomal recessive form: Affect CD40 on B-cells or enzymes like activation-induced cytidine \ndeaminase (AID), a DNA-editing enzyme expressed in B cells. The B-cell response to T-independent antigen is unaffected. CD40–CD40L interactions are also \nrequired for IL-12 secretion. So, defects in this pathway result in increased susceptibility to \nintracellular pathogens. In normal immune response, B-cells expressing CD40 on their surface interact with CD40L on \nT-cells to undergo class switching from IgM to various other classes (IgG, IgA, IgE) depending on \nthe type of antigen. Thus, failure of this class switching leads to an increase in IgM with extremely \nlow levels of IgG and no IgA or IgE. 92 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical features include recurrent pyogenic infections caused by low levels of opsonizing IgG \nantibodies. Patients are highly susceptible to pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. The illustration below depicts the defects in components of T-cell &amp; B-cell interactions that \ngive rise to primary immunodeficiency. Other options: Option A: Defective cytokine signalling in T-cell precursors is seen in X-linked Severe Combined \nImmunodeficiency (SCID). It is caused by a mutation in the common -chain (c) subunit of \ncytokine receptors. This defect disrupts Interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21) \nsignalling, leading to low T-cell and NK-cell numbers. Although B-cell numbers are normal, these \nare non-functional due to the absence of T-cell help, resulting in impaired antibody synthesis. Option B: Mutation in the STAT3 gene is seen in an autosomal dominant form of Hyper IgE \nsyndrome (also known as Job syndrome), characterized by recurrent staphylococcal skin \nabscesses, recurrent pulmonary infections often with pneumatoceles and atopic dermatitis. Here, \nserum IgE levels are markedly elevated (due to IgE overproduction without modulation), and IgA, \nIgG and IgM concentrations are generally normal. Option D: A defect in NADPH oxidative pathway is seen in chronic granulomatous disease, \nleading to failure of the oxidative burst in phagocytes, predisposing individuals to \ncatalase-positive microbial infections.",

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by deficient cell-mediated immunity \nto candida, usually due to defects in IL-17. Mutations affecting the IL-17 signalling pathway lead to 93 \nSold by @itachibot impaired IL-17 production and defective TH17 function, compromising mucosal and skin defence \nmechanisms and increasing susceptibility to fungal infections. Patients develop persistent fungal infections of the skin, nails, oral cavity, and genitals, primarily \ncaused by Candida species. Despite chronic mucocutaneous involvement, these patients typically \ndo not develop invasive candidiasis. A key feature of CMC is the absence of delayed \nhypersensitivity to candida antigens.

      "explanation": "This history of delayed separation of the umbilical cord with recurrent pneumonia and peripheral \nleucocytosis is highly suggestive of leucocyte adhesion defect (LAD). In this defect, there is \nreduced phagocyte surface expression of sialyl-Lewis X. LAD is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting leukocyte function. Neutrophils have reduced \nadhesion, mobility, and phagocytic ability. There are three main types of LAD: • LAD 1- Defective 2 integrin common chain (CD18), leading to abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis \nand defective tight adhesion. • LAD 2- Reduced phagocyte surface expression of sialyl-Lewis X (fucosylated protein), leading to \nabnormal neutrophil rolling and tethering. • LAD 3- Defect in regulatory protein (kindlin 3, also known as Fermt 3) involved in activating the \nligand affinity for 2 integrins, leading to abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion (milder \nthan type 1). LAD is characterised by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, reduced inflammatory \nresponses despite elevated blood neutrophilia, and delayed wound healing and delayed umbilical \ncord loss. in patients with LAD type 3, there may be bleeding as 2 integrin on platelets is \nnon-functional.

      "explanation": "The seminiferous tubules are an immunologically privileged site. Immunologically privileged sites can tolerate the introduction of antigens without eliciting an \nimmune response. This allows a higher likelihood of graft survival, even without perfect HLA \nmatching. As a result, an allograft can be placed in these sites without endangering a rejection \nreaction. The unique immune tolerance in these regions is primarily due to the lack of effective lymphatic \ndrainage, which prevents antigen presentation to the immune system, and the presence of \nblood-tissue barriers that restrict immune cell infiltration. Low vascularity contributes to immune \nprivilege by minimising antigen exposure and immune cell recruitment. Examples of immune-privileged sites are the anterior chamber of the eye, cornea, testes, and \nbrain.
