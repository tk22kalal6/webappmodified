      "explanation": "B lymphocytes reside in the splenic follicles. Lymphocytes are part of the adaptive immune system. They include B lymphocytes and T \nlymphocytes. B lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow and then migrate to secondary lymphoid \norgans - follicles of spleen and in follicles of lymph nodes. T lymphocytes are produced in the \nbone marrow but mature in the thymus. They are also present in the periarteriolar lymphoid \nsheaths (PALS) of spleen and paracortex of lymph node. 61 \nSold by @itachibot In a lymph node, follicles may contain a central region called germinal centre.

Cleft palate, cardiac defects and hypocalcemia \n(parathyroid hypoplasia/aplasia) suggest a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. In this disorder, \na decreased size of paracortical areas of lymph nodes is noted. DiGeorge syndrome is characterised by thymic aplasia, causing a deficiency of T cells and absent \ncell-mediated immunity. Thus, paracortical areas of lymph nodes and periarteriolar sheaths of the \nspleen, where T cells reside, are reduced in size. B cells are usually not affected. 62 \nSold by @itachibot",
