      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The protein coat covering the nucleic acid in a virion is called capsid. The parts of a virus include: • Nucleocapsid- capsid with enclosed nucleic acid • Tegument- proteinaceous structure present between the envelope and capsid. • Envelope- lipid-containing membrane that surrounds some virus particles. It is acquired during \nviral maturation by a budding process through a cellular membrane. • Peplomers- virus-encoded glycoproteins, on the outer surface of the envelope as projections. Characteristics of viruses: • Do not have a cellular organization • Have either DNA or RNA but never both • Obligate intracellular parasites • Lack enzymes necessary for protein and nucleic acid synthesis • Filterable • Cannot be grown on artificial media • Unaffected by antibiotics. Note : Martinus beijerinck proposed the theory of contagium vivum fluidum (living infectious \nfluid) while studying the cause of mosaic disease of tobacco plant. He is known as the father of \nvirology. 342 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Segmented genome is found in orthomyxovirus. Segmentation of viral genomes allows for the exchange of intact genes between related viruses \nduring coinfection. This recombination is known as reassortment. There is a rearrangement and \njoining of nucleic acid sequences to form a unique chimeric genome. The new genome is usually \nless fit than the parent viruses, but occasionally, it results in an evolved virus with increased \nfitness. Examples of segmented viruses (ARBO): • Arenavirus (2 segments) • Rotavirus (11 segments) • Bunyavirus (3 segments) • Orthomyxovirus (8 segments) The image below shows the segmented genome seen in the influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae)",

      "explanation": "An ss-RNA with a 3'-5' strand is a negative-stranded RNA. These viruses use RNA replicase \nor RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during genome replication. In positive-stranded RNA viruses, the viral RNA itself acts as mRNA. In negative-stranded RNA viruses, the polarity is opposite that of mRNA. So the genome requires \nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize their mRNA. Examples of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Mnemonic: Always bring da polymerase or fail to \nreplicate): • Arenaviruses • Bunyaviruses • Deltaviruses • Paramyxoviruses • Orthomyxoviruses • Filoviruses • Rhabdoviruses",
