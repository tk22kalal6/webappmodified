The purpose of the condenser lens is to focus the light from the illuminator onto the specimen. \nMicroscopes with a stage condenser lens render a sharper image than those with no condenser \nlens. The simple microscope was invented first by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the father of microscopy \nand microbiology. It uses 1 lens for magnification. The compound microscope, introduced by \nHans and Zacharias Janssen uses 2 lenses, an objective lens and an eyepiece, to provide better \nmagnification power than the simple microscope.",

      "explanation": "Sporulation occurs in the stationary phase of the bacterial growth curve, which is marked as C in \nthe image. The bacterial growth curve is obtained when a batch of bacteria is seeded in a liquid medium and \nincubated. It consists of 4 distinct phases: • Lag phase (A) - The bacteria adapt to a new environment. They synthesize and accumulate \nenzymes and metabolic intermediates required for multiplication. Thus, there is no increase in \ncell number but cell size increases. Maximum cell size is obtained towards the end of this phase. • Log or exponential phase (B) - The bacteria start dividing and their numbers increase \nexponentially with time. Cells are smaller and stain uniformly. The growth rate is constant. • Stationary phase (C) - There is depletion of nutrients and accumulation of toxic products. Thus, \ncell division reduces and a state of equilibrium is attained, where the number of new cells formed \nequals the number that die. Growth rate is zero. Sporulation occurs during this phase. Many \nbacteria produce secondary metabolic products such as exotoxins and antibiotics. • Death phase or the phase of decline (D) - Growth rate is negative. The population decreases due \nto cell death from nutritional exhaustion, toxin accumulation and the action of autolytic enzymes. \nInvolution forms are common. 17 \nSold by @itachibot",

All the non-sporing \npathogens (mycobacteria, brucellae, salmonellae) are killed in pasteurization. In the Holder \nmethod, heat resistant Coxiella burnetti may survive. Note: Louis Pasteur pioneered the techniques of pasteurization and sterilization. He also first \nadvanced the germ theory of disease which states that most diseases were caused by \nmicroorganisms.

Acid-fast bacteria (like MTB) in a stained Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear appear bright red against a \nblue background. Steps involved in ZN staining are: • Place the sample on slide evenly spread it with rotational movement • Air-dry the slide and fix it by passing it over a flame • Apply carbol fuschin stain and heat to fix it. • Wash with water to remove excess stain • Decolourise with alcohol • Apply Methylene blue/Malachite green stain • Wash with water to remove excess stain • View under the microscope Kinyoun modified the classical ZN staining such that heat fixing is not required. It is called the \ncold method. It involves increasing the concentration of phenol acid and the duration of staining. \nThe slide is then washed with water and decolourized with acid alcohol. Counterstaining with \nLoeffler's methylene blue or malachite green is done for a minute and viewed under a microscope. \nAcid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright red against a blue background. The image attached below summarizes the steps. 22 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: It depicts the order of Gram staining, which was discovered by Hans Christian Gram in \n1884. • Primary staining with para-rosaniline dye (crystal violet, methyl violet or gentian violet). • Application of dilute solution of iodine. • Decolorisation with an organic solvent (ethanol, acetone, aniline). • Counterstaining with the dye of contrasting colour (carbol fuchsin, safranine, neutral red). Option B: It includes the steps for performing Albert's stain which is used for detected \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae. • A heavy smear of the bacterial isolate is prepared on a glass slide and allowed to dry without \nfixing. • Albert’s stain is applied for (3-4) minutes. Then it is washed with water and Albert’s iodine is \napplied for one minute. • Wash with water and let dry with blotting paper. • Examine the slide under oil immersion. Corynebacterium diphtheriae are slender bacilli with an arrangement resembling the letters V or \nL. They have metachromatic granules at the poles of bacilli which are also called polar bodies, \nvolutin, or Babes-Ernst granules. Albert staining is useful in the demonstration of metachromatic \ngranules. The presence of metachromatic granules helps to distinguish C.diphtheriae from \ndiphtheroids which lack them.

Transduction is a process of acquiring bacterial DNA from a bacteriophage (virus) that has \nincorporated bacterial DNA from previous host bacteria. 25 \nSold by @itachibot Other methods of exchange of genetic material are transformation and \nconjugation. Transformation involves the uptake of genetic material from the environment, which \nis released by other bacteria. Conjugation is the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to \nanother bacterial cell through a sex pilus or bridge. The transferred DNA is a plasmid, a circle of \nDNA that is distinct from the main bacterial chromosome.",

PCR is an automated process in which a single or a few copies of a DNA piece is amplified to \ngenerate of thousands to millions of copies of that particular DNA sequence. There are 3 basic \nsteps are involved in PCR: • DNA extraction from microorganism • Amplification of extracted DNA - Denaturation (95°C), Primer annealing (55°C), Extension \n(72°C) • Gel electrophoresis of the amplified product PCR is used in rapid diagnostic tests for infections (e.g. HIV DNA), forensic investigations etc. The \nfounder of PCR is Karry B Mullis. 26 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The enzyme involved in RT-PCR is reverse transcriptase (RT) which has RNA-dependent DNA \npolymerase activity. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reation (RT-PCR), reverse transcriptase synthesizes \nDNA from the RNA template. RT-PCR can be used for the demonstration of poliovirus RNA, \ncausing paralytic poliomyelitis, in CSF. It can also be used for the detection of viruses from \nnasopharyngeal swabs (SARS-CoV2, H1N1). In real-time RT-PCR, fluorescent dyes or DNA probes are used to quantify the pathogen DNA load \nin the specimen. So, it can be used to quantify viral loads in HIV, hepatitis B, etc., and is also \ncalled quantitative PCR (qPCR). 27 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Jumping genes are also called transposons. Transposons are genetic elements that can move between chromosomal and extra-chromosomal \nDNA molecules. Insertion of a transposon leads to acquisition of new characteristics by the \nrecipient DNA. Transposons contain several genes, including those necessary for their migration \nfrom one genetic locus to another. They may contain genes for specialised functions like antibiotic \nresistance. However, they do not contain genes for their replication. Jumping genes were discovered by Barbara McClintock and she was awarded the Nobel Prize in \nPhysiology or Medicine 1983 for the same. Other options: Options A and B: The cytoplasmic carriers of genetic information are termed plasmids or \nepisomes. Option D: A cosmid is a type of hybrid plasmid that contains a Lambda phage cos sequence. (Cos \nsites + plasmid = cosmids).",

It is a component of hand-hygiene, \nwhich is demonstrated by the image below. 28 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Disinfectants like chlorhexidine and alexidine have a biguanide functional group. They are \nmostly used as oral disinfectants and hand products. They are bactericidal but not sporicidal. \nMycobacteria are also resistant to these compounds.",

In plasma sterilisation, radiofrequency energy is applied to create an electromagnetic field \nthrough which hydrogen peroxide vapours are passed.

It is used for sterilisation \nheat-sensitive equipment like heart-lung machines, respirators, suture materials etc. Sterilization \ncontrol is monitored by Bacillius atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilus. Option B: Gamma rays cause breakage of DNA. It destroys spores and vegetative cells, but is not \neffective against viruses. It is referred to as cold sterilisation and is used in commercial plants to \nsterilize plastics, syringes, swabs. Sterilization control is monitored by Bacillus pumilius. Option D: Ultraviolet rays are used to sterilise biosafety cabinets, entryways, operation theatres \nand laboratories. 29 \nSold by @itachibot Components of Immune system",
