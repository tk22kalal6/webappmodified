      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The immunity conferred to a neonate receiving the BCG vaccine is artificial active immunity, as it \ninvolves administering a live attenuated vaccine form of Mycobacterium bovis to stimulate an \nadaptive immune response and develop antibodies, establishing long-term immunity. Types of adaptive immunity: • Natural active immunity: It results from either a clinical or an inapparent infection by a microbe. • Artificial active immunity: It is the resistance induced by vaccines which are preparations of \nkilled or attenuated microorganisms or their products. • Natural passive immunity: It is the immunity passively transferred from mother to baby. In \nhuman infants, maternal antibodies are transmitted predominantly through the placenta, while in \nanimals such as pigs, the transfer of antibodies occurs mainly through the colostrum. • Artificial passive immunity: It is the resistance passively transferred to a recipient by the \nadministration of antibodies. Hyperimmune sera of animal or human origin, convalescent sera, \nand pooled human immunoglobulin are used for this purpose. • Combined immunization: A combination of the active and passive methods of immunization is \nused. Examples of the above types of immunity: Note: Adoptive immunity is immunity in which immunologically competent lymphocytes are \ninjected. The transfer factor is composed of these immunologically competent lymphocytes. It can \npassively transfer cell-mediated immunity against those antigens to which the donor is sensitive.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Giving pre-formed immunoglobulin (e.g. Tetanus immunoglobulin) directly is an example of \npassive immunity, which is not long-lasting. The differentiating features between active and passive immunity: Negative phase: It is the time period during which the level of measurable immunity is lower than \nit was before the antigenic stimulus. This is because the antigen combines with any pre-existing \nantibody and lowers its level in circulation. It is seen at the beginning of the active immune \nresponse. Secondary type response: If an individual who has been actively immunized against an antigen \nexperiences the same antigen subsequently, the immune response occurs more quickly and \nabundantly than during the first encounter.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Bone morphogenetic protein-like receptors are not pattern-recognition receptors. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are essential for the innate immune system. They identify \npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) common to classes of microbes and trigger \nimmune responses. These receptors can be found on the cell surface, detecting extracellular \npathogens, or within the endosomes and cellular matrix, detecting intracellular invading viruses. PRRs activate pro-inflammatory pathways, promote phagocytosis in cells like macrophages, \nneutrophils and dendritic cells, and may act as secreted proteins binding directly to pathogens. \nBased on the localization and functional characteristics, PRRs are classified as: • Membrane-bound PRRs: • Toll-like receptors (TLR)- detect microbial carbohydrates and lipoproteins (Option B) • C-type lectin receptors (CLR)- detect mannose residues • Cytoplasmic (intracellular) PRRs: 41 \nSold by @itachibot • Nucleotide oligomerization (NOD)-like receptors (NLR) - NOD1 and NOD2 - Detects bacterial \ncell wall peptidoglycans (Option A) • RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) - detect viral RNA (Option C) • Secreted PRRs On the contrary, BMP receptors are multifunctional transmembrane serine-threonine kinase \nreceptors that belong to the transforming growth factor  (TGF-) superfamily, regulating cell \ngrowth, differentiation, and apoptosis with no role in pattern recognition. Also, there are no \nreceptors termed \"BMP-like receptors\".

This is characteristic of toxic shock syndrome - commonly caused by \nstaphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), which is a superantigen. Superantigens act by causing polyclonal activation of T cells. They activate a large number of T \ncells irrespective of their antigen specificity. In contrast to regular antigens which bind to the binding groove on T cells, superantigens bind \noutside the groove directly to the lateral aspect of the TCR  chain. This leads to a massive release \nof cytokines and polyclonal activation of T cells. Clinically, this manifests as fever, hypotension, and skin exfoliation. Examples of organisms that produce superantigens: • Bacterial 43 \nSold by @itachibot • Staphylococcus aureus- Enterotoxins • Group A streptococci - Pyrogenic exotoxin • Mycoplasma arthritidis- mitogen 1 • Yersinia enterocolitica • Yersinia pseudotuberculosis • Viral • Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) • Cytomegalovirus (CMV) • Rabies nucleocapsid • HIV-encoded negative regulatory factor. • Fungal- Malassezia furfur",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Affinity maturation is due to somatic hypermutation. Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies gain increased affinity, avidity, and \nanti-pathogen activity. It is a result of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes in \nB cells, coupled to selection for antigen binding. This process occurs in the germinal centers and proceeds for weeks after acute infection or \nvaccination, or for many cycles during chronic infection. The resulting antibodies can be highly \nmutated from their germline-encoded counterparts, with increases of several orders of magnitude \nin affinity for antigen compared to the corresponding naïve B cell receptors (BCRs). Other options: Option A: Isotype switching, also known as class switch recombination, is a process where the \nconstant region of the antibody heavy chain is changed, leading to a switch in the antibody isotype \n(e.g., from IgM to IgG). This process is crucial for the functional properties of antibodies but is not \ndirectly involved in affinity maturation. Option C: mRNA splicing is a cellular process that involves the removal of introns and the joining \nof exons to generate mature mRNA. While this process is essential for the production of \nfunctional antibodies, it is not specifically associated with affinity maturation. Affinity maturation \nprimarily occurs through somatic hypermutation. Option D: VDJ rearrangement is the process by which the variable regions of immunoglobulin \ngenes are assembled from gene segments (V, D, and J segments). This process contributes to the \ndiversity of antibodies but is distinct from affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs after \nVDJ rearrangement and is driven by somatic hypermutation in the variable regions.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Wassermann's reaction is an example of a complement fixation test. It is a non-specific test for the \ndiagnosis of syphilis. An antigen combines with its (specific) antibody in the presence of complement, and the \nantigen-antibody complex adsorbs the complement. This reaction is not visible and requires the \nuse of an indicator (sheep erythrocytes and the specific anti-erythrocyte antibody).",

Lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria activates the alternative complement pathway. The binding of mannose-binding lectin to mannose residues (on the surfaces of Salmonella, \nNeisseria, and Listeria) activates the lectin complement pathway. 52 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "This girl presents with features of hereditary angioneurotic edema, which is due to a deficiency of \nC1 inhibitor. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is an autosomal dominant disorder that is more common than \ncomplement deficiency states. A deficiency of C1 inhibitor leads 53 \nSold by @itachibot to unregulated activation of kallikrein. This increases the production of vasoactive peptides such \nas bradykinin. It causes episodes of edema affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces such as the \nlarynx and the gastrointestinal tract. This may result in life-threatening asphyxia or nausea, \nvomiting, and diarrhea after minor trauma or emotional stress.
