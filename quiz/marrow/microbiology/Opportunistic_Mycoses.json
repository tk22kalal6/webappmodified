      "explanation": "Pathogenic varieties of cryptococcus including C. neoformans and C. gattii are laccase positive. \nThey also have ability to grow at 37° C and these factors are used to differentiate them from \nnon-pathogenic cryptococci. Cryptococci have been classified into 5 serotypes (A, B, C, D, and AD) based on their capsular \npolysaccharide: • Three serotypes fall under Cryptococcus neoformans - A(var. grubii), D(var. neoformans), and \nAD(a hybrid of serotypes A and D). Although serotype AD is very similar to serotypes A and D, the \nisolates still comprise a discrete group that can be distinguished. • The serotypes B and C are now considered a different species - Cryptococcus gattii. Niger seed agar is a solid medium used for selective and differential isolation \nof Cryptococcus neoformans from clinical specimens. C. neoformans and C. gattii produces brown 480 \nSold by @itachibot colonies on this medium due to the formation of melanin. Melanin is produced by laccase \nusing caffeic acid as the substrate. The following image shows pigmented colonies of C. gattii growing on niger seed agar. Cryptococcal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, is an opportunistic infection seen in \nindividuals with AIDS. Flucytosine and amphotericin B are used in the treatment of this \ncondition.",
