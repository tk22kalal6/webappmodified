      "explanation": "The intravenous route of administration is the most effective route of administration for shocking \ndose in causing anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity syndrome. There are 2 clinical syndromes which are \ncharacterised as: • Anaphylaxis - acute, potentially fatal systemic form • Atopy - chronic, recurrent, non-fatal, localized form Priming dose: For induction of hypersensitivity reactions, the host should have contact with the \nantigen, leading to priming of the appropriate B or T lymphocytes. Shocking dose: Subsequent contact with allergen causing manifestations of hypersensitivity. 75 \nSold by @itachibot Effectiveness: intravenous &gt; intraperitoneally~subcutaneously &gt; intradermally (least)",

In this method, the serum is injected from an allergic person into the skin of a nonallergic \nindividual. Then a suspected antigen is later injected into the same site. A positive P-K reaction is \na wheal and flare reaction seen in the non-allergic individual. This indicates that the suspected \nantigen is causing hypersensitivity.

      "explanation": "This child who developed tingling in the mouth, and swelling of the lips and face after eating shelf \nlife is an example of an IgE mediated type of hypersensitivity reaction. 76 \nSold by @itachibot Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rapidly and \naffects the whole body. It is characterized by a sudden release of histamines and other chemicals \nfrom the immune system in response to an allergen, such as certain foods, medications, insect \nstings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to \nthe allergen.The primary mediators are histamine and serotonin. The secondary mediators are \nprostaglandins and leukotrienes. Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include: • Respiratory Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to \nbronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of \ntightness in the chest. • Skin Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) \nare common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of \nexposure to the allergen. • Cardiovascular Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. \nPatients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock. • Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, \nparticularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens. • Neurological Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to \nthe sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.",
