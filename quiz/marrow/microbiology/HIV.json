      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Subtype C of HIV is the most common in India. It causes more than 95% of HIV infections. Subtypes A and C are more readily transmitted by heterosexual contact than subtype B, which is \nmainly transmitted by homosexual contact and injections.",

        "d": "Is a thermostable virus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "HIV is a thermolabile virus. It is readily inactivated by heating to 60 °C for 10 minutes and at 100 \n°C in seconds. At room temperature (20–25 °C) in the dried blood, it may survive for 1 week. Option A: HIV crosses the blood-brain barrier. It may cause encephalopathy leading to loss of \nhigher functions, progressing to dementia. Option B: HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus. Its genome is composed of two copies of identical \nsingle-stranded positive-sense RNA. Option C: HIV is inactivated by treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, 50% ethanol, 35% \nisopropanol or 10% household bleach. A 2% solution of glutaraldehyde is effective for the \ndisinfection of medical instruments. 393 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The tat gene (trans-activating gene) is a non-structural gene. HIV has structural and non-structural genes: • Structural genes- •enes coding for structural protiens: • gag- Codes for core and shell protein p55, which is cleaved to p15, p18 and p24 • env- Codes for envelope glycoprotein gp160 which is cleaved to gp120 and gp41 • pol- Codes for enzymes: Polymerase, reverse transcriptase, protease and endonuclease • Non-structural and regulatory genes: • tat- Trans-activating gene • nef- Negative factor gene • rev- Regulator of virus gene • vif- Viral infectivity factor gene • vpu- (only in HIV-1) and vpx (only in HIV-2) • vpr- Stimulates only the promoter region of the virus • LTR- Long terminal repeat sequences",

        "a": "RNA-DNA-RNA",
        "b": "RNA-DNA",

        "d": "DNA-RNA-DNA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "HIV replicates by the sequence RNA-DNA-RNA. The provirus initiates viral replication by \ndirecting the synthesis of viral RNA and other components. Hence, the sequence is \nRNA–ssDNA–dsDNA–RNA. HIV genome is composed of 2 single-stranded positive-sense RNA. When a virus infects a cell, the \nviral RNA is transcribed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, first into single-stranded DNA and \nthen to double-stranded DNA which is integrated into the host chromosome. Note: If the options include RNA-DNA-RNA and RNA-DNA-DNA-RNA then the latter would be \nthe choice. The given image represents HIV replication 394 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "c": "Blood transfusion",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Heterosexual transmission is the most common mode of transmission of HIV infection in \ndeveloping countries such as India and African countries. In many Western countries, \nmale-to-male sexual transmission is the dominant mode of transmission. Blood transfusion carries the highest risk per 10000 exposures of getting HIV from an infected \nperson. However, it is not the most common mode of transmission.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Male-to-female HIV transmission has more risk of causing infection than female-to-male ",
        "b": "The risk of acquiring HIV with unprotected receptive anal intercourse is lower than that with ",

        "d": "Male circumcision is associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition for heterosexual men"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The risk of HIV acquisition associated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse is relatively \nhigher than that seen in penile-vaginal intercourse. This is because the rectal mucosal membrane \nis thin and fragile and anal intercourse is associated with microtrauma (rectal tears). The differences in transmission rates between men and women are because the vagina and cervix \nare exposed to semen for a longer duration, increasing the risk of transmission. However, the \npenis and urethral orifice are exposed relatively briefly to infected vaginal fluid, lowering the risk.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The specific binding of the HIV to the CD4 receptor is by the envelope glycoprotein gp120. Option B - Cell fusion occurs via binding to gp41. Cell fusion is essential for infection to take \nplace. Option C, D - Binding to CD4 receptor requires the participation of a co-receptor CXCR 4 for T \ncell tropic HIV strains and CCR 5 for macrophage-tropic strains. 395 \nSold by @itachibot",

HIV-antibody spot test was negative, however p24 antigen assay was \npositive. You explain to him that he is currently in the window period for HIV. Which of the 391 \nSold by @itachibot following statements would you use to explain the concept to him?",
      "options": {
        "a": "It is the time period between infection and onset of first symptoms",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the patient has experienced a high-risk exposure to HIV due to sharing \nneedles during IV drug abuse with an HIV-positive partner. The period between infection and detection of antibodies against HIV is known as the window \nperiod. The window period may last anywhere between 2–8 weeks to a few months. During this period, \nthe individual may be highly infectious. HIV infection can be detected during this period by p24 \nantigen assay and PCR. 396 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given patient is in the latent period of HIV infection. During the latent phase of HIV \ninfection, the CD4+ T cell count declines steadily and not rapidly. All patients infected with HIV pass through a phase of clinical latency during which they are \nasymptomatic. This can last for years. During the latent phase, patients show positive HIV \nantibody tests and they are infectious. There will be varying degrees of viral multiplication. Throughout the course of untreated infection and even during the stage of clinical latency, HIV is \nactively replicating or is sequestered in lymphoid tissues.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Antibodies against gp41 will be detected first by ELISA or Western blot. Antibodies to HIV usually appear within 3–6 weeks of primary infection. The appearance of \nHIV-binding antibodies occurs prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. The only viral \nproteins that elicit neutralizing antibodies are the envelope proteins gp120 and gp41. The order of appearance of antibodies is as follows: Antibody to envelope gp41 &gt; Antibodies to gag protein (p24 and p55) &gt; Antibodies to \nenvelope gp120 &gt; Antibodies to gag protein p17 &gt; Antibodies to pol gene products (p31 and \np66).

ELISA is a simple, relatively \ninexpensive screening test. The most commonly used confirmatory test is Western blot. Western blot demonstrating \nantibodies to products of all three of the major genes of HIV (gag, pol, and env) is conclusive \nevidence of infection with HIV. It is considered positive if it shows antibodies against at least two \nof the following gene products: p24, gp41, gp120/160. 398 \nSold by @itachibot Myxoviruses and Rhabdoviruses",
