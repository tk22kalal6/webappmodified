      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The puborectalis muscle encircles the posterior and lateral aspects of the anorectal junction, \ncreating the anorectal angle. At rest, the anorectal angle is held at 90 - 100°. This becomes more acute (70 - 90°) during \nsqueezing due to the contraction and shortening of the puborectalis muscle. This brings the 600 \nSold by @itachibot anorectal junction higher and nearer to the pubic symphysis. During straining and defecation, the anorectal angle becomes more obtuse (110 - 180°) due to \nrelaxation of the puborectalis muscle. The anorectal ring is formed by the fusion of: • Puborectalis • Deep external anal sphincter • Internal anal sphincter Note: Anismus, is caused by a failure of the puborectalis and external anal sphincter to relax \nduring defecation straining. This results in a failure of the anorectal angle to straighten during \ndefecation.",

It is associated with less morbidity but has a higher recurrence \nrate. Abdominal approaches (laparoscopic, robotic, or open) are preferred for younger patients, \nparticularly those with constipation or associated pelvic floor disorders. Perineal procedures: • Delorme's mucosectomy- involves mucosal stripping and muscle plication of the rectal prolapse \nusing interrupted sutures. It is performed externally under regional or general anaesthesia. • Thiersch's encirclement- a steel wire, or Silastic or nylon tape, is placed around the anal canal. \nLargely obsolete now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed \ndefaecation • Altemeier rectosigmoidectomy- involves removal of the prolapsed rectum and associated \nsigmoid colon, followed by which a coloanal anastomosis is created. It is often complicated by \npoor bowel control with faecal soiling secondary to the loss of rectal reservoir. Abdominal procedures: • Suture rectopexy 603 \nSold by @itachibot • Mesh rectopexy • Posterior (Well’s and lvalon’s) • Anterior (Ripstein’s) • Lateral (Orr-Loygue) • Ventral • Resection Rectopexy (Frykman–Goldberg) The principle of all abdominal operations for rectal prolapse is to fix the rectum in its normal \nanatomical position.",

It commonly presents with rectal bleeding in the setting of chronic straining or \nconstipation. Histology reveals a thick layer of fibrosis obliterating the lamina propria and a \ncentral fibrinous exudate.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Dissection medial (not lateral) to the endopelvic fascia investing the mesorectum causes local \nrecurrence. Dissection lateral to the avascular anatomic space, risks injury to the mixed autonomic nerves, \ncausing impotence in men and bladder dysfunction in men and women. Transmesorectal resection involves complete removal of the lymph node bearing mesorectum \nalong with its intact enveloping fascia. It is a curative resection of rectal tumours of the middle \nand lower thirds of the rectum, either as part of Low Anterior Resection (LAR) or \nAbdominoperineal Resection (APR). 606 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: The majority of colorectal cancers are sporadic. Approximately 5% of all colorectal \ncancers are attributed to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary \nnon-polyposis colorectal cancer). Option B: The large bowel can tolerate delivered radiation doses of up to 6000 cGy. However, \na lower dose of 45 Gy is recommended for colorectal tumours. High levels of radiation targeted at \ncolon tumours would include the small bowel in the treatment field. This results in complications \nsuch as radiation enteritis. Option D: The precise location of the rectal tumour is determined using rigid \nproctosigmoidoscope or flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy. The other investigations used in rectal \ncancer include: • Digital rectal examination - for assessing the depth of penetration • Endorectal ultrasound or MRI - provides an accurate assessment of the extent of invasion of the \nbowel wall • MRI with an endorectal coil - is the investigation of choice to assess the 'T' and 'N' stages • CECT - for evaluation of metastasis.",

      "explanation": "Adenocarcinoma is the most common variant of rectal carcinoma. Colorectal cancer is: • The second most common malignancy globally • The second most common cancer in women • The third most common cancer in men • The fourth most common cause of death due to cancer. Symptoms of rectal carcinoma include: • Painless bleeding - earliest and most common • Alteration of bowel habits - change in frequency and consistency of the stool • Tenesmus - unable to pass a motion even when there is the sensation of needing to evacuate the \nbowel. It is suggestive of a tumor of the lower half of the rectum • Early morning bloody diarrhea (option C) - passage of blood and mucus in addition to feces. Pain \nand weight loss are usually late symptoms Abdominal examination and digital rectal examination are used for the primary evaluation. Rigid \nsigmoidoscopy is performed to obtain a biopsy.

D \nDistant metastasis Surgery is the mainstay of management for rectal carcinoma. Non-operative management is \noffered to only those patients who have a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant. The type of surgery depends on multiple factors (size, location, age of the patient, etc). However, \nthe general consensus is: • Early cancer (T1 and a few T2) is locally excised via the transanal approach. • Most rectal cancer is treated by anterior resection and colorectal/coloanal anastomosis. • Low extensive tumors are treated by laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection(APR) and \npermanent colostomy. • Hartmann’s operation (option A) is preferred in old and frail patients due to poor anal sphincter \nand postoperative incontinence.",

      "explanation": "T2 rectal cancers are managed by transabdominal resection. Transanal local excision is recommended for selected T1, N0 early-stage cancers which fulfill the \nfollowing criteria: • Small (&lt;3 cm), well- to moderately-differentiated tumors • Tumors within 8 cm of the anal verge • Tumors limited to &lt;30% of the rectal circumference • Tumors with no evidence of nodal involvement • Full-thickness excision must be feasible. 612 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "5-Fluorouracil-based regimens with leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) reduce recurrence and \nimprove survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) is also used as a second-line chemotherapy agent. Adjuvant \nchemotherapy is routinely recommended in patients with lymph node involvement. Option B: ABVD regimen is used for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Option C: RCHOP regimen is used for B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Option D: MVAC regimen is used for advanced bladder carcinoma.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hartmann’s operation is an excellent procedure in an elderly, frail patient in whom there is \nconcern about anal sphincter function or the viability of an anastomosis. Through an abdominal incision, the rectum is excised, the rectal stump is stapled closed and the \nproximal colon exteriorized as a permanent end colostomy. Note: Endoluminal stenting is being increasingly used in patients with obstructing carcinomas. It \ncan be either used as a palliative procedure or to relieve the obstruction. Only rectosigmoid and \nupper rectal tumours are suitable for stenting because stent impingement on the anorectum in \nlow cancers can result in tenesmus. 613 \nSold by @itachibot Anus and Anal Canal",
