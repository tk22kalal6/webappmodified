      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The above plain abdominal radiograph shows a typical double-bubble sign suggestive of duodenal \natresia. The double-bubble represents dilatation of the stomach and the proximal duodenum. Duodenal atresia is often associated with trisomy 21/Down syndrome, prematurity, maternal \npolyhydramnios, cardiac malformations, and malformations of the hepatobiliary system. It is caused due to failure of recanalization or partial recanalization of the duodenum or failure of \nvacuolization of the duodenum from its solid cord stage. The anatomic variants are as follows: • Type I: • most common • mucosal web with intact muscle wall (so-called windsock deformity) • Type II: • two ends separated by a fibrous cord, but muscle continuity present • Type III: • complete separation of two ends with a gap within the duodenum Clinical features: • Obstructive features such as • bilious emesis (due to duodenal obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater) 425 \nSold by @itachibot • postprandial emesis • upper abdominal distension with a scaphoid lower abdomen • Delayed passage of meconium Abdominal radiographs show the double-bubble sign. If distal air is present, an upper GI contrast \nstudy should be considered to exclude midgut volvulus. Treatment: • The initial treatment of infants with duodenal atresia includes nasogastric or orogastric \ndecompression. • IV fluids and parenteral nutrition are started to prevent acid-base imbalance. • Echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and radiology of the chest and spine should be performed \nto evaluate for associated anomalies. • Definitive correction of the atresia is done by duodenoduodenostomy. This procedure is also \npreferred in cases of the concomitant or isolated annular pancreas.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The radiographic image showing the presence of an enlarged gastric gas bubble (single bubble) is \nsuggestive of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS). It most commonly presents with \nnon-bilious projectile vomiting between 2-8 weeks of age and is only rarely seen after 13 weeks. Hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus results in constriction and obstruction of the \ngastric outlet. First-born male infants are at the highest risk. Risk factors for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: • Turner syndrome • Edwards syndrome 426 \nSold by @itachibot • Erythromycin or azithromycin exposure in the first 2 weeks of life either orally or via mother's \nmilk. Palpation of the olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium is considered pathognomonic.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis most presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting. It is \ncommon between 2 and 8 weeks of age. Hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus results \nin constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. Male infants are at a higher risk. Clinically, when the infant is given a test feed, an olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper \nquadrant and visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right across the abdomen. Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic \nabnormality- hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Persistent vomiting results in \nloss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development of metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) \nand hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-). All infants with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are evaluated with an ultrasound \n(investigation of choice). It confirms the diagnosis in the majority of cases.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS) most commonly presents with non-bilious \nprojectile vomiting. It is common between 2-8 weeks of age. When the infant is given a test feed, visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to \nright, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality i.e \nhypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development \nof metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-). The kidneys try \nto compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3-. However, the loss of sodium stimulates \nthe secretion of aldosterone via the RAAS pathway. The aldosterone causes active reabsorption of \nsodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions. Loss of potassium ions leads to the development \nof hypokalemia. Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It is \ncalled paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead of 427 \nSold by @itachibot compensating that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine. The cervix sign and nipple sign are signs of CHPS seen on ultrasonography: • Double-layered hypertrophic mucosa protrudes into the stomach, creating the so-called nipple \nsign. • The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervix \nand is sometimes referred to as the cervix sign. The given ultrasound image shows thickened pylorus, with cervix sign and nipple sign. Treatment: • The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality has to be \ncorrected preoperatively. • The Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for its treatment.",

      "explanation": "The picture depicts Highly Selective Vagotomy (HSV). Post-procedure acid reduction is minimum \nin HSV. It involves resection of crowfoot branches, 6cm from the gastroesophageal junction but stopped \n7cm from the pylorus. The nerve of Latarjet from the anterior and posterior vagal trunk supplies \nthe acid pepsin areas of the stomach. It is spared in HSV. Usually, the motor branch to the \npylorus is also preserved. There are 3 types of vagotomy • Highly selective vagotomy • Truncal vagotomy + gastrojejunostomy • Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy. Highly selective vagotomy • Acid reduction is minimum. • Highest ulcer recurrence rate. • Minimum postoperative complications. Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy • Acid reduction is maximum. • Least ulcer recurrence rate. • Maximum postoperative complications. Note: Vagal nerves are motor to the stomach and denervation of the antro-pyloro-duodenal \nsegment results in gastric stasis after truncal vagotomy. Hence, a drainage procedure, most \ncommonly Heineke–Mikulicz pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy is done along with vagotomy. The criminal nerve of Grassi is a branch of the posterior vagal trunk that arises at the \ngastroesophageal junction and supplies the fundus of the stomach. It is called a criminal \nnerve because it is often missed during vagotomy procedures and can result in recurrent peptic \nulcer disease. 437 \nSold by @itachibot",

Hypoglycemia is seen in late dumping syndrome secondary to raised \ninsulin levels. Dumping syndrome is a complication occurring post gastrectomy. It can be early or late. Early dumping syndrome is due to the high osmotic load that reaches the small bowel, leading to \nsequestration of fluid from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This fluid shift \ninduces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects such \nas: • Epigastric fullness • Sweating • Lightheadedness • Tachycardia • Diarrhea Symptoms are aggravated by having more food and relieved by lying down. 439 \nSold by @itachibot Late dumping syndrome is due to an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. This \nhypoglycemia causes a catecholamine surge, which results in predominantly cardiovascular effects \nsuch as: • Diaphoresis • Tremulousness • Light-headedness • Tachycardia • Confusion The symptoms are aggravated by exercise and relieved by having food. The principal treatment for both types of dumping syndrome is dietary manipulation. Meals based \non fat and protein are known to work the best. Octreotide before meals is useful.",

The disease seems to be caused by \noverexpression of transforming growth factor-alpha i.e., TGF-alpha (not TNF-alpha), which \nstimulates the EGFR pathway, resulting in increased proliferation of mucus cells/foveolar \nhyperplasia.
