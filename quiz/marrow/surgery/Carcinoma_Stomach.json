      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for gastric carcinoma. Aspirin, which is a COX inhibitor, is protective against gastric cancer. Eating refrigerated food has reduced the need for salting of food for preservation, and thus \nreduced the incidence of gastric cancer. Males are more commonly affected as compared to females.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most common site of gastric adenocarcinoma in the Asian population is the antrum. This is \nbecause H. pylori infections are relatively more prevalent in Asian countries and are associated \nwith carcinoma of the body and distal stomach than the proximal stomach. However, in western countries, the proximal stomach is the most common site. This is attributed \nto a lesser prevalence of untreated H.pylori infections and a greater burden of chronic GERD and \nobesity in western countries. 448 \nSold by @itachibot",
