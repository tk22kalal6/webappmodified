      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the rapid onset of the disease and the examination findings are suggestive \nof inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. It mimics acute \nmastitis. The hallmark of inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the \ndermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin, often without a discrete underlying \ntumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling of \nthe breast, warmth, erythema and edema. A breast lump may or may not be present. A diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidly \nprogressive swelling with inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imaging \nfeatures with ultrasound and a mammograph is non-specific due to the underlying erythema and \nedema. A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes combined-modality treatment: 212 \nSold by @itachibot • Neoadjuvant chemotherapy • Mastectomy • Radiation therapy • Hormonal therapy- for ER-positive tumors • Trastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumors Option B: Giant fibroadenomas occasionally occur during puberty. These are benign solid \nencapsulated slow-growing tumors over 5 cm in diameter. It presents as a painless lump in the \nbreast. They are managed by excision via a submammary incision. Option C: Phyllodes tumors usually occur in women over the age of 40 years but can appear in \nyounger women. Phyllodes tumor is mostly benign even though it is also called cystosarcoma \nphyllodes. It presents as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. They are usually \nmobile over the chest wall despite their large size. This tumor does not infiltrate the skin. Nipple \nretraction is not seen in this condition. Benign lesions can be treated with enucleation or wide \nlocal excision. Massive tumours, recurrent tumours and malignant lesions are treated with a \nmastectomy. Option D: Galactocele are the most common benign breast lesions in lactating women. It is a \ncystic enlargement of the mammary gland containing milk. They are mostly detected during \nlactation or in the third trimester of pregnancy but rarely, may also present after stopping \nbreastfeeding. Clinically, the mass is usually firm and non-tender and presents as a solid \ntumour-like lesion on physical examination. The patient usually notes the \nlesion during lactation or some period after lactation. Needle aspiration, followed \nby excision should it recur, is the standard method of treating galactocele.",

      "explanation": "In the given image, the orange peel-like appearance, also called as peau d’orange is caused by \ncutaneous lymphatic edema, due to the obstruction of subcutaneous lymphatics. It is the hallmark \nof inflammatory carcinoma. Option A: Infiltration of Cooper’s ligaments leads to dimpling of the skin. Option C: Infiltration of the lactiferous ducts leads to nipple retraction. Cancer-en-cuirasse is an aggressive form of cancer, where there is cutaneous and subcutaneous \ninfiltration of the cancer cells. Note: While Peau d’orange indicates skin involvement, dimpling of the skin and nipple retraction \ndo not indicate skin involvement.",
