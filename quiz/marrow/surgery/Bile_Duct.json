      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The presence of fever and chills, along with the MRCP showing multiple areas of \nintrahepatic beading is typical of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Option B: Caroli's disease is a rare congenital condition characterized by irregular dilatation of the \nintrahepatic bile ducts with a normal extrahepatic duct system. It is common in both sexes and \nmostly presents before the age of 30 years with abdominal pain, cholangitis, or end-stage liver \ndisease. MRCP shows irregular, cystic dilation of the large proximal intrahepatic bile ducts with a \nnormal common bile duct. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory \nstrictures involving the intra and extra-hepatic biliary tree. It is a progressive condition that leads \nto secondary biliary cirrhosis. 771 \nSold by @itachibot MRCP or ERCP will show demonstrate multifocal, diffuse dilatation and strictures of the \nintrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, this pattern is a beading or chain of lakes appearance. \nPseudodiverticula of extrahepatic bile ducts are pathognomic of PSC. MRCP is useful in diagnosis \nand surveillance, while ERCP is reserved for the treatment of dominant strictures and to exclude \nmalignancy. The below image shows a cholangiogram of primary sclerosing cholangitis: The common age group of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 30-45 years. Men are affected twice as \ncommonly as women. Two-thirds of these cases are associated with ulcerative colitis. It is also \nassociated with Riedel’s thyroiditis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. 10–20% of patients develop \ncholangiocarcinoma. Clinical features of a patient with PSC include pruritis, fever, chills, right upper quadrant \ndiscomfort, jaundice, and weight loss. Liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with an elevation of ALP and GGT and smaller rises \nin the aminotransferases. Bilirubin values may be variable. Liver biopsy excludes other causes of cholestatic liver disease and defines the stage of PSC. It \nshows onion skin concentric periductal fibrosis. With disease progression, periportal fibrosis \noccurs, progressing to bridging necrosis, and eventually biliary cirrhosis. Currently, there is no known effective medical therapy. Surgical management involving resection \nof extrahepatic biliary tree and hepaticojejunostomy has shown reasonable effects. For patients \nwith advanced liver disease, liver transplantation is the only available option. Other options: Option C: Oriental cholangitis, also known as recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is characterized by \nrecurrent attacks of cholangitis due to bile stasis and stone formation. Patients between 30-40 \nyears and both sexes are equally affected. It is caused due to infections (liver flukes, E.coli, \nKlebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus). Patients present with Charcot's triad (intermittent fever, \npain, and jaundice). MRCP shows intra or extrahepatic calculi, dilatation of ducts, and strictures. Option D: Biliary carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) most commonly affects patients &gt;60 years \nand presents with fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and features of obstructive jaundice. MRCP 772 \nSold by @itachibot shows irregular narrowing of the bile duct involved by the tumor, with asymmetric upstream \ndilatation of the intrahepatic ducts.",

      "explanation": "Injury to the right aberrant posterior sectoral duct associated with bile leak is classified \nas Strasberg’s type C injury. Biliary injury may occur post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common site of bile leak \nfollowing cholecystectomy is the cystic duct. MRCP is the gold standard for complete morphological evaluation of the biliary tree. MRCP with \nmagnetic resonance angiography is more useful in cases of associated vascular injury. A HIDA \nscan can confirm the presence of a bile leak or biliary obstruction. The Strasberg classification of bile duct injury is widely used to anatomically define bile duct \ninjuries. Classification • Type A: Bile leak from cystic duct stump or a minor biliary radical in the gallbladder fossa • Type B: Occluded right posterior sectoral duct. • Type C: Bile leak from the divided right posterior sectoral duct. • Type D: Bile leak from the main bile duct without major tissue loss. • Type E: Injury to the main hepatic duct; classified according to the level of injury • E1: Transected main bile duct with a stricture more than 2cm from the hilus. • E2: Transected main bile duct with a stricture less than 2cm from the hilus • E3: Stricture of the hilus with right and left ducts in communication. • E4: Stricture of the hilus with separation of right and left hepatic ducts. • E5: Stricture of the right aberrant sectoral and main bile ducts. 773 \nSold by @itachibot Management of bile duct injuries is shown below:",

      "explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best investigation in a patient \nsuspected of post-cholecystectomy biliary leaks. Patients with post-cholecystectomy biliary leak usually present with fever, jaundice and \nabdominal pain. USG is used for an initial evaluation in such cases and can show a collection in \nthe sub-hepatic space. The most common bile leak following cholecystectomy is from the cystic duct. This can be treated \nby placing a biliary endoprosthesis (stent) in the common bile duct across the origin of the cystic \nduct. 774 \nSold by @itachibot MRCP shows fluid collections arising from bile leaks but cannot differentiate these from other \ncauses of fluid collections. ERCP is the best investigation as it has the advantage of being both diagnostic and \ntherapeutic. ERCP is useful post-cholecystectomy as there is a high likelihood of a retained stone \nand stone extraction and/or temporary stenting may be required. HIDA scan is the most sensitive investigation for biliary leakage. CT scan can show focal fluid collections, ascites, biliary obstruction, hepatic atrophy, signs of \nsecondary biliary cirrhosis and any vascular injury.",

      "explanation": "In the case of a common bile duct injury with a leak and a patient presenting with signs of \nlocalized peritonitis, the next step of management is an ultrasound-guided aspiration. This will \nbe followed by ERCP and stenting. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common cause of bile duct injury. Major biliary leakage \nis usually seen 2 to 10 days after cholecystectomy. Affected patients typically present with: • Fever • Abdominal pain • Bilious ascites • Mild jaundice • Leukocytosis • Elevations in the serum levels of ALP and GGT. Management of bile duct injury: If the injury is identified during surgery: • Partial injury to the bile duct (&lt;3mm) - repair the injury • Complete transection without loss of segment - anastomose over T-tube • Complete transection with loss of segment - close distal end and carry out Roux-en-Y \nhepaticoduodenostomy/jejunostomy If the leak is suspected postoperatively: Transabdominal ultrasonography is initially performed to assess the leak. • If the patient presents within 48 hours - Re-explore and repair • If the patient presents after 48 hours - USG-guided aspiration or pigtail catheter insertion. 776 \nSold by @itachibot This is followed by ERCP and stenting.",

      "explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best investigation for the \ndiagnosis of bilhemia. Bilhemia is a condition in which bile flows into the bloodstream through the hepatic veins or \nportal vein branches. This flow occurs due to a high intrabiliary pressure, exceeding that of the \nvenous system. The cause can be the erosion of gallstones into the portal vein, or accidental/iatrogenic trauma. \nThis condition can be fatal secondary to the embolization of large amounts of bile into the lungs. \nUsually, bile flow is low, and the fistulas close spontaneously. Its clinical features include: • Rapidly progressive jaundice • Marked direct hyperbilirubinemia, without elevation of the hepatocellular enzyme levels. • Septicemia. Diagnosis of bilhemia is best made by ERCP. Treatment is directed at reducing the intrabiliary pressure through stent placement or \nsphincterotomy. Endovascular embolization can also be done.",

Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is defined as a partial or total absence of permeable bile duct \nbetween porta hepatis and the duodenum. It is due to inflammatory fibrosis of the biliary tree. It \nleads to obstruction to bile flow thereby causing leaking of conjugated bilirubin into the \ncirculation.
