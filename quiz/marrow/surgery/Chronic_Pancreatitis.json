      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of chronic pancreatitis with SPINK1 mutation is suggestive of tropical \npancreatitis (nutritional pancreatitis). Tropical pancreatitis is histologically indistinguishable from \nchronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Normally, if trypsinogen does become prematurely activated within the pancreas, it is inhibited by \nSPINK1 and then gets destroyed. A loss-of-function mutation in SPINK1 affects this process and \npredisposes to tropical pancreatitis. Tropical pancreatitis is a form of idiopathic pancreatitis that begins at a young age and is usually \nseen in Indonesia, southern India (Kerala), and tropical Africa. It is associated with a high \nincidence of diabetes mellitus (a brittle form of pancreatogenic diabetes) and stone \nformation.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hereditary chronic pancreatitis is caused by the mutation of PRSS1 (protease serine 1). Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder, associated with a gain-of-function \nmutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on chromosome 7q. This leads to \nintrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen and the production of the degradation-resistant form of \ntrypsin. PRSS1 mutation accounts for about two-thirds of cases of hereditary pancreatitis. There is an \nincreased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, particularly if the patient smokes tobacco. Option B: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is located on the \nlong arm of chromosome 7, and it regulates bicarbonate and chloride concentrations in \nrespiratory and pancreatic secretions. • Homozygous CFTR mutations result in cystic fibrosis • Heterozygous mild CFTR mutations predispose to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and chronic \npancreatitis Options C and D: Serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) or pancreatic secretory trypsin \ninhibitor (PSTI) is associated with tropical calcific pancreatitis as well idiopathic chronic \npancreatitis.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The diagnostic test with the best sensitivity and specificity for chronic pancreatitis is the secretin \ntest. Secretin is a hormone secreted by the small intestines. It normally stimulates the pancreas to \nsecrete a fluid with a high concentration of bicarbonate. Secretin stimulation test is a test that \nmeasures the ability of the pancreas to respond to secretin. In order to perform the test, a tube is passed into the duodenum. Secretin is administered \nintravenously and the contents of the duodenal secretions are aspirated and analyzed over a \nperiod of about 2 hours. The test becomes abnormal when  60% of the pancreatic exocrine \nfunction has been lost. This usually correlates well with the onset of chronic abdominal pain. Other investigations to diagnose chronic pancreatitis: Pancreatic calcifications can be seen on abdominal X-rays. Endoscopic ultrasound showing the presence of four or more of these following features is highly \nsuggestive of chronic pancreatitis: • Presence of stones • Visible side branches • Cysts • Lobularity • An irregular main pancreatic duct • Hyperechoic foci and strands 839 \nSold by @itachibot • Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct • Hyperechoic margins of the main pancreatic duct An abdominal CT scan is the initial modality of choice for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. CT or \nMRI scan will show the outline of the gland, the main area of damage, and the possibilities for \nsurgical correction. The investigation of choice for chronic pancreatitis is MRCP with secretin stimulation. ERCP is \nthe gold-standard investigation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of hemosuccus pancreaticus. CT angiography is the gold \nstandard in diagnosing hemosuccus pancreaticus. Haemosuccus pancreaticus, also known as pseudohaemobilia, is a rare cause of GI bleeding, due \nto blood originating from the pancreatic duct into the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. It is \nusually caused by the erosion of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the splenic artery. In hemosuccus pancreatitis, abdominal pain radiating to the back accompanied by melena is the \nmost typical presentation. The pain usually has an up and down pattern, which means it changes \nin intensity over time. This is due to the transient closure of pancreatic ducts. Other features \ninclude: • Hematochezia • Hematemesis • Anemia • Jaundice • A palpable pulsatile mass with a thrill murmur • Retroperitoneal bleeding 845 \nSold by @itachibot Laboratory values show elevated lipase and low hemoglobin levels. The diagnosis is mainly \nthrough imaging modalities like upper GI endoscopy, ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and \ncontrast-enhanced CT scan. CT angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool. It helps to localize the site of bleed and plan \nthe management accordingly. Once the bleeding source is identified, hemodynamically stable patients are managed by coil \nembolization, balloon tamponade, or stent placement. Hemodynamically unstable patients are managed by distal pancreatectomy.",

Surgery in pseudocyst is indicated for patients who fail to respond to endoscopic treatment. Pancreatic pseudocysts closely attached to the stomach should be treated with a cystogastrostomy. \nIn this procedure, an anterior gastrostomy is performed.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Milwaukee classification is used for the assessment of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or dyskinesia (SOD) is a clinical syndrome in which pain, \nbiochemical abnormalities, and dilatation of the bile duct and/or pancreatic duct are attributed to \nabnormal functions of the sphincter of Oddi. SOD may result from stenosis of the sphincter or from dysmotility. Scarring or stenosis of the \nsphincter can result from the passage of stones, pancreatitis, or prior endoscopic \nsphincterotomies. Milwaukee classification of the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) : • Type I SOD is usually managed by Sphincterotomy. Whether such patients should undergo dual \nsphincterotomies (biliary and pancreatic) is debatable. • Type II SOD is usually assessed by a manometry first, followed by surgical or medical \nmanagement based on manometry findings. • Type III SOD is difficult to manage. Surgical management, such as sphincterotomy has variable \noutcomes with response rates ranging from 8% to 65%. Medical management in the form of \nnifedipine, proton-pump inhibitor, botulinum toxin injection, etc. does not have long-term \nbenefits as well.

The ampulla of Vater is intubated, and contrast injected into the biliary \nand pancreatic ducts to display the anatomy radiologically. 847 \nSold by @itachibot ERCP is helpful for: • Direct opacification of bile ducts and pancreatic ducts • Dynamic information during the introduction and drainage of the contrast medium • Visual assessment of the duodenum and ampulla of Vater, thereby facilitating biopsy • Interventional procedures such as sphincterotomy, stone extraction, biliary stenting, and biliary \nstricture dilatation ERCP shows filling of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), common bile duct (B), and gallbladder (G). \nThe MPD and CBD drain into the major papillary (large arrow). The small accessory pancreatic \nduct (small arrows) drains separately into the minor papilla (arrowhead). The most common complication of ERCP is acute pancreatitis. The main diagnostic disadvantage \nwith ERCP is the underfilling of ducts above a stricture. 848 \nSold by @itachibot Carcinoma Pancreas",
