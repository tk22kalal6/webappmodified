If this does \nnot control the haemorrhage, the esophageal balloon is inflated as well, compressing the venous \nplexus between them. Only gastric contents can be aspirated. 82 \nSold by @itachibot Image B shows the Minnesota tube.

      "explanation": "Bipolar diathermy is more effective than monopolar diathermy in preventing electrosurgical \ninjury during laparoscopic surgery. Option A: During laparoscopic surgery, an artificial pneumoperitoneum is produced by \ninsufflation of the abdominal cavity with CO2 through a temporary port created by carefully \nperforating the abdominal wall and peritoneum. As a common practice, blind insertion of a Veress \nneedle is performed to enter the peritoneal cavity. However, in patients with prior abdominal surgeries, there is a higher chance of bowel adhesions \nand bowel wall injury during blind insertion of veress needle. Therefore the Hasson approach is \nused for direct visualization while establishing the intraperitoneal access. Option C: Clot formation may take place during laparoscopic surgery as a result of intraoperative \nbleeding. The routine use of 5000–7000 units of heparin per liter of irrigation fluid helps to avoid \nthe formation of clots. Option D: If there is no contraindication for enteral feeding (e.g bowel resection) and no sign of \nileus postoperatively, oral feeding can be initiated 4-6 hours after surgery. Initially, a liquid diet is \ninitiated, and if well-tolerated light meals can be initiated.",

There are two methods used for the creation of a pneumoperitoneum: • Closed method • Open method 88 \nSold by @itachibot The closed method using the Veress needle has a small but significant potential for intestinal or \nvascular injury on the introduction of the needle or trocar. Proper placement of the needle can be \ndetermined by the inability to re-aspirate injected saline. The normal insufflation rate is 4-6 \nlitres/min. The use of the open technique for creating a pneumoperitoneum avoids the morbidity related to a \nblind puncture. To achieve this, a 1 cm vertical or transverse incision is made at the level of the umbilicus, stay \nsutures are applied, and the fascia is dissected. Free penetration into the abdominal cavity is \nconfirmed by the gentle introduction of a finger. A Hasson trocar, shown below, is inserted and \nanchored, and pneumoperitoneum is created. This is the Hasson or modified Hasson approach. This method is preferred for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the \nsmall bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound. 89 \nSold by @itachibot",

Drains can be - 94 \nSold by @itachibot • Open - They are based on the principle of gravity • Semi-open - Their action is based on capillary effect • Closed - They carry out their actions through suction Suction drains are commonly used in chest, breast, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries. \nThey remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the \nsurgical site. Romo Vac drain is a negative suction drain closed drain kept in the subcutaneous \ntissue. Romo Vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling \nexcision, and amputations. Special types of drains: • Chest drains are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. \nThey are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax. • After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate \ndrainage of bile, a T tube may be used. Drain insertion site care: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the \ndrain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze \npieces placed below and above the drain site. Removal of drains: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped \nand the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the \nperforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is as given \nbelow. • Drains used in surgeries like thyroidectomy are usually removed within 24 hours. Their main \npurpose is to cover postoperative bleeding. • In a mastectomy, a drain is placed for 5 days to collect serous collections. • Drains used to cover the colorectal anastomoses are placed for 5-7 days. • Common bile duct T-tube drains are usually placed for 10 days. • Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain \nis minimal. After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can \nbe removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area \nfor a week.",
