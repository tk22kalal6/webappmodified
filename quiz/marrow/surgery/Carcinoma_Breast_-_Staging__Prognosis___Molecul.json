      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Tis classification is used for the staging of ductal carcinoma in situ and Paget’s disease only. Tis means carcinoma in-situ. • Tis (DCIS) - includes ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) • Tis (Paget) - includes Paget's disease of the nipple NOT associated with evident invasive \ncarcinoma and/or carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the underlying breast parenchyma 243 \nSold by @itachibot According to the latest American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system (8th \nedition), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is not included in Tis since it is a benign entity. LCIS is considered a proliferative disease that has a risk of developing breast carcinoma in the \nfuture, and hence, it is not included in the classification system. Pleomorphic LCIS is also \nconsidered a benign condition.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "TNM staging of the tumor is T3 N1 M0. In the given scenario: • The bigger lump is 6 cm in size - T3 • Ipsilateral mobile axillary lymph nodes - N1 • No distant metastasis - M0. In tumor size assessment, the greatest dimension is taken into consideration. For example, in a 6 \nx 2 cm lump, 6 cm is taken into account, and the tumor is classified as T3 (&gt;5 cm). If 2 lumps \nare present in the same breast, staging is according to the bigger lump. If lumps are present in \nbilateral breasts, separate staging is done for both the lumps. Any contralateral lymph node involvement is considered as distant metastasis.",

      "explanation": "MACIS is not used in breast cancer. It is a prognostic index for thyroid cancer. The Nottingham prognostic index, Gail and Claus models, and Van Nuys prognostic index are all \nassociated with breast cancer assessment. Van Nuys prognostic index is used to identify patients with duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who do \nnot need radiation therapy. This grading system is based on the following parameters: • Patient’s age • DCIS nuclear grade and presence of microcalcification • Size of the lesion • Width of the surgical margin The Nottingham prognostic index segregates the patients into four groups and is used to predict \nthe 5-year survival. It helps to formulate treatment plans. Nottingham Prognostic Index = (0.2 × Tumor size in cm) + grade + nodes The Gail and Claus models are used for assessing the risk of development of breast carcinoma. \nIt includes the following parameters: • Number of first-degree relatives with carcinoma breast • Age at menarche • Age at first live birth • Number of breast biopsies Claus model provides individual estimates of breast cancer risk according to the decade of life, \nbased on the presence of first- and second-degree relatives with breast cancer and their age at \ndiagnosis. Note: Neither the Gail model nor the Claus model accounts for the risk associated with mutations \nin the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.",

A score ranging from 1 (lesions with the best prognosis) to 3 (lesions with the worst prognosis) is \ngiven for each of the four prognostic predictors. Total scores range from 4 (least likely to recur) to \n12 (most likely to recur). Note: The type of microcalcification seen on imaging, helps in determining the nuclear grade of \nDCIS.
