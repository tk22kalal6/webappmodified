      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Psychological re-evaluation is necessary to address the underlying psychological blocks in a \npatient who is unable to comply with the diet. Morbidly obese individuals, especially those with central obesity, have large livers that make \nsurgery impossible. Liver shrinkage diet helps reduce the size of the liver. This allows mobility for \nthe surgeon and increases the chances of a safer procedure. Liver shrinkage diet: • Low-carbohydrate, low-fat and moderate protein diet • Started at least 2 weeks prior to the surgery 463 \nSold by @itachibot The ability to comply with the diet and lose weight suggests that the patient is willing to make an \neffort to adopt lifestyle modifications.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of fever, tachycardia, and leucocytosis in a postoperative patient of \nLSG should raise suspicion for leak along the gastric staple line. The next best step in the \nmanagement of this patient is to perform a contrast-enhanced CT. Leaks following LSG most commonly occur in the proximal third of the stomach, close to the \nangle of His. Early leaks are due to tissue trauma and staple misfire, and late leaks are usually due \nto ischemia and high intragastric pressure. Management of the leak involves providing nutritional support to the patient and adequate \ndrainage. Once the leak is diagnosed, the patient should be kept nil per oral. Total parenteral nutrition and antibiotic therapy should be started in the patient. Drainage can be \ndone either by CT-guided percutaneous catheter placement, endoscopic stenting, or operative \nprocedures. Note: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for an anastomotic leak. Treatment with \ncontinuous positive airway pressure might reduce this risk.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and radiograph (dilated bowel segments with valvulae conniventes in \nthe left upper quadrant) are suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Bariatric surgery, specifically, \nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is associated with the creation of mesenteric defects. The small \nbowel can herniate through these defects (internal hernia) and get strangulated, resulting in bowel \nobstruction. In addition, as the person loses weight (due to the bariatric procedure), the protective, \nspace-occupying effect of the mesenteric fat is lost and hernia spaces open up, further increasing \nthe risk of internal hernia. The laparoscopic procedure has a higher risk compared to open \nsurgery since fewer adhesions form to tether small-bowel loops and prevent them from 467 \nSold by @itachibot herniating. Adequate closure of the mesenteric defects by the surgeon at the time of operation significantly \nreduces the risk of internal hernia. Other complications specific to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: • Nutritional deficiencies: iron (most common), folate, Vitamin A, D, K and B12 • Anastomosis site leak • Bleeding from the site of gastrojejunostomy • Dumping syndrome • Marginal ulcers • Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism Option A: Sleeve gastrectomy is often complicated by staple line leak. Option B: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is associated with band slippage and erosion. Option D: Endoluminal stapling is also used to create a gastric sleeve. It is associated with \npostoperative nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and transient dysphagia.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The usual length of the common channel in biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) is 50 cm (0.5 m). Revisions increase common channel by up to 150 cm. The length of the common channel plays a significant role in the amount of weight loss achieved \nwith BPD procedure. A shorter common channel implies a greater length of the bypassed small \nbowel.
