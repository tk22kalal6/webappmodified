      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Patients with polytrauma are shifted into a supine or prone position (not in a lateral position) by \nlaying them over a firm surface to restrict spinal movement. As per ATLS guidelines, in patients with trauma, airway management is first done along with \ncervical spine stabilization. All trauma patients until proven otherwise are considered to have an \ninjured vertebral column. The patients are placed supine on a firm surface without rotating or bending the spinal column \nand a rigid cervical collar (philadelphia collar) is applied. Aspiration can be prevented by putting \nthe patient in the prone position and strapping can be done to provide further stabilization. Long spine boards with straps are helpful in the rapid transport of the patient from one place to \nanother. The patient can be put on the long spine board by log-rolling (a technique where four \npeople hold the patient and roll the patient like a log without allowing rotation or bending of the \nspine). Conscious and alert patient indirectly means that they don’t need intubation and their airway is \npatent. If the patient is unconscious always check the airway and if needed, endotracheal \nintubation must be done immediately by various methods. Preferably by direct laryngoscopy and \nintubation.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical situation suggests a cervical spine injury due to trauma. The patient should not \nbe shifted and a portable X-ray machine should be used for radiography after neck stabilization. Management in a trauma patient with a suspected cervical fracture involves the following steps: 156 \nSold by @itachibot • Spinal immobilization with a rigid cervical collar and a long spine board is the immediate step in \nthe management of blunt/penetrating cervical trauma cases. • It is followed by a gross assessment of spinal cord function by eliciting extremity movement. \nTenderness over the injured vertebrae or the presence of a deformity is indicative of an associated \nfracture. • Imaging is done by X-ray or CT. Portable X-ray machines are preferred to avoid further injury \nwhile mobilizing the patient. They are useful in visualizing thoracic and lumbar vertebrae but \nnot the cervicothoracic junction. Cervical CT has been made the modality of choice in most \nemergency departments owing to the high quality of images that can be obtained.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "157 \nSold by @itachibot Hypotension in acute spinal injury is due to loss of sympathetic tone. The classic presentation of neurogenic shock is hypotension in the setting of warm, well-perfused \nextremities in a paralyzed patient. This condition requires intravascular volume expansion and \nvasopressor support. Option B: High cervical spinal cord injury (SCIs) may have immediate respiratory suppression. \nThis requires airway management and ventilatory support because of paresis of the phrenic \nnerves. Hypoventilation can occur from paralysis of the intercostal muscles (injury to the lower \ncervical or upper thoracic spinal cord) or the diaphragm (injury to C3 to C5). Option C: Canadian C-Spine rule and NEXUS are validated clinical decision tools to help \ndetermine the need for radiographic evaluation and to clinically clear the cervical spine. NEXUS criteria: There are five criteria included under NEXUS. If a trauma patient meets all five \ncriteria, then no radiography is required and the cervical c-spine collar may be removed. However, \nif any one of the criteria is met then radiography is done to evaluate further. The NEXUS criteria include: • No posterior midline cervical spinal tenderness • No evidence of intoxication • A normal level of alertness • No focal neurologic deficit • No painful distracting injuries Option D: Patients with or without neurological deficits should be removed from the backboard as \nsoon as possible. A patient who is allowed to lie on the hardboard for more than 2 hours is at high \nrisk for pressure ulcers.",

They are also \nknown as the hard signs of neck trauma: • Pulsatile bleeding • Expanding hematoma • Air bubbling from penetrating injury 158 \nSold by @itachibot • Absent radial pulse • Respiratory distress • Presence of neurological deficit • Fluid resistant hemorrhagic shock • Audible bruit or palpable thrill • Signs of stroke/ cerebral ischemia The presence of any of these hard signs indicates major neurovascular/ airway injury and is an \nindication for surgical exploration of the trauma region as soon as possible. Neck trauma is classified based on the different regions of the neck. • Zone I: thoracic inlet to cricoid, associated with maximum mortality. It contains large vascular \nstructures as well as the trachea and esophagus. • Zone II: cricoid cartilage to the angle of mandible, most commonly prone to injury and most \neasily accessible for surgery. It contains the carotid and vertebral arteries, jugular veins, and \nstructures of the aerodigestive tract. • Zone III: angle of the mandible to the base of the skull. Structures within zone III include blood \nvessels that are difficult to expose surgically. Management: • If the patient is hemodynamically unstable: neck exploration • If the patient is stable: • Zone II injury: Conservative management • Zone I and Zone III: Angiography and angioembolisation are indicated. If it fails then neck \nexploration should be done. 159 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a patient with a stab injury and hypotension not responding to IV \nfluids indicates persistent hypotension due to ongoing hemorrhage and the next step in the \nmanagement is to perform an eFAST. Cardiogenic shock or hemorrhagic shock are the most likely causes of persistent hypotension in a \ntrauma patient. Ultrasound evaluation using eFAST to look for pericardium, pleural cavities, and \nabdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the \nsource of the bleed. In patients with persistent hypotension due to blunt trauma, the pelvis should be wrapped in a \nsheet for stabilization until radiography can be done. Evaluation of CVP or ultrasound of the IVC may further assist in distinguishing between \ncardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. It is mostly fatal if not controlled, and requires immediate management. Blood and plasma \ntransfusions are provided in a ratio of 2:1. Patients with persistent hypotension requiring surgical \nintervention include: • Blunt trauma and massive hemothorax • Penetrating trauma • Hemoperitoneum • Gunshot injuries to the chest or abdomen • Penetrating weapon remaining in place. Other options: Options C and D: CECT can be done only when the patient is hemodynamically stable. Option B: Tube thoracostomy has no role in this patient's management since the X-ray shows \nclear lung fields.",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, eFAST(extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) is \nleast useful in diagnosing retroperitoneal hematoma as the sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting \nretroperitoneal hematomas is extremely poor. FAST is a rapid, noninvasive bedside test that uses sonography to detect free fluid in the abdomen \nand assess patients for potential thoracoabdominal injuries. Technique: • The patient is placed in a supine position • With a 3.5-5.0 MHz convex transducer the following regions are scanned : • Subxiphoid transverse view: assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries • Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant: assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, \nand Morison pouch 160 \nSold by @itachibot • Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant: assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury • Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region: assess the bladder and pouch of \nDouglas eFAST stands for extended FAST and incorporates Left and right thoracic views to assess for \npneumothorax and haemothorax.

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of flail chest with respiratory failure. Management of this \ncondition is IPPV (invasive positive pressure ventilation). A flail chest occurs when a segment of the chest wall does not have bony continuity with the rest \nof the thoracic cage. This condition results from blunt trauma associated with multiple rib \nfractures i.e., 2 adjacent ribs or 3 or more ribs fractured in two or more places. The blunt force required to disrupt the integrity of the thoracic cage typically produces an \nunderlying pulmonary contusion as well. 161 \nSold by @itachibot On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards, and therefore, less air \nmoves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards. This is known as paradoxical \nrespiration. The diagnosis is made clinically, not by radiography. To confirm, the paradoxical motion of a \nchest wall segment can be observed for several respiratory cycles and during coughing. Voluntary splinting as a result of pain, mechanically impaired chest wall movement, and the \nassociated lung contusion are all causes of hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient is also at \nhigh risk of developing a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Treatment: • Chest strapping or splinting should be avoided. • Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) or \nepidural analgesia, and physiotherapy. • IPPV (Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation) is reserved for patients developing respiratory \nfailure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen.

This can lead to lung collapse. The vital step in the management of rib fractures is to reduce pain and prevent the development \nof pneumonia. Rib fracture causes intense pain during breathing and increases the risk of \npulmonary infections as the patient is not able to cough forcefully. In mild to moderate cases, pain can be managed by intravenous opioids. In severe cases, patients \nmay require epidural analgesia. 162 \nSold by @itachibot In addition to adequate analgesia, chest physiotherapy like deep breathing, frequent coughing, \nincentive spirometry should be encouraged in these patients.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of trauma with decreased breath sounds and a hyper-resonant note on \npercussion indicates pneumothorax. The presence of tachycardia, hypotension and elevated JVP is \nsuggestive of tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax develops when there is a parietal or visceral pleural tear. This tear acts as \na one-way valve i.e. air enters the pleural space from the lung or chest wall during inspiration but \nhas no way to escape during expiration, leading to the collapse of the affected lung. It is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, acute dyspnea, sudden onset hemodynamic \ncompromise (tachycardia, hypotension, low O2 saturation, loss of consciousness), neck vein \ndistention, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, decreased chest movements on the \naffected side, hyper-resonance on percussion on the affected side and absent or decreased breath \nsounds on the affected side. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should never be delayed awaiting \nradiological confirmation. Management includes: • Immediate management: Needle decompression or needle thoracostomy with a wide bore needle \nin the 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line. In the pediatric age group, the needle \nthoracostomy location is at the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. • Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th intercostal space \nin the triangle of safety. The triangle of safety is bounded anteriorly by the lateral border of the pectoralis major, \nposteriorly by latissmus dorsi and inferiorly by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple. The X-ray below shows a left-sided tension pneumothorax. There is a large, well-demarcated area \ndevoid of lung markings on the left side. The yellow arrows are pointing to the tracheal deviation \nand the mediastinal shift to the right side. 163 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Options A: Pericardial tamponade can mimic tension pneumothorax, but the absence of a \ntympanic note on percussion rules out its possibility. A patient with pericardial tamponade can \npresent with hypotension, raised JVP, and muffled heart sounds (Beck’s triad), with normal \nbreath sounds and no tracheal shift. Option C: Dullness in percussion at the base of the left inferior angle of scapula in conjunction \nwith tubular breath sounds (Ewart’s sign), chest pain that improves while sitting upright and \nworsens when lying down and pulsus paradoxus are indicative of pericardial effusion. Pericardial \neffusion develops into tamponade when the effusion leads to increased pressure, impairing \nventricular filling and reducing cardiac output. Option D: Massive hemothorax is the accumulation of &gt;1500 ml of blood or one-third or more \nof the patient’s blood volume in the chest cavity. The patient will have collapsed neck veins, \ndecreased breath sounds and a dull note on percussion.",

      "explanation": "166 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario of hemodynamic instability and muffled heart sounds are suggestive of \ncardiac tamponade. The entry wound is sealed on only 3 sides with an occlusive dressing if a \npneumothorax is suspected. When there is a pneumothorax with a sucking wound, the immediate step is to cover the wound \nwith gauze pieces and tape on 3 sides. As the patient breathes in, the dressing occludes the wound, preventing air from entering into the \nthoracic cavity. During exhalation, the open end of the dressing allows air to escape from the \npleural space. This is known as a flutter-valve effect. Following this, a chest tube is inserted away from the site of the wound. Cardiac tamponade must be di■erentiated from tension pneumothorax in a patient with \nhemodynamic instability and distended neck veins. Cardiac tamponade is characterized by Beck’s triad: • Muffled heart sounds • Distended neck veins • Hypotension Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyper resonance on \npercussion on the affected side. These are not present in a patient with cardiac tamponade. Diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be done by eFAST which shows fluid in the pericardial sac. • Definitive management - emergency thoracotomy or sternotomy",

      "explanation": "In a blast injury, the liver is the least vulnerable to blast wave (primary blast) injury. 167 \nSold by @itachibot Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an \nexplosion. Primary blast injuries result from the rapid overpressure or shock waves produced by \nan explosion. These injuries result from the dramatic changes in barometric pressure projecting \noutwards from the point of detonation. They predominantly cause damage to air-filled hollow \norgans of the body from rapid pressure change (barotrauma). This includes the middle ear, lungs, \nand GIT. The most sensitive and most frequently injured hollow organs are the tympanic membranes &gt; \nlungs. Blast damage to the lungs is the most common cause of life-threatening injury following an \nexplosion. Solid organs are the most resistant to blast injuries as the parenchymal disruption requires very \nhigh levels of overpressure.

      "question": "Question 33: A 17-year-old boy is brought to the ED after being involved in a high-speed motorcycle \ncollision. He is hypotensive with a systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg. A FAST scan is positive. At \nlaparotomy, he is found to have a large amount of bleeding from behind the liver with \nhollow-viscous perforation. Temporary application of a Pringle manoeuvre does not control \nthe bleeding. However, laparotomy packs are placed, and the bleeding appears to slow down. \nThe systolic blood pressure fails to increase even after aggressive resuscitation. The patient’s \npH is 7.06 and his temperature is 34°C. What would be the next best step in the management \nof this patient?",

      "explanation": "This patient has a blunt trauma abdomen. He is hypothermic and he is battling acidosis. Thus, he \nshould be subjected to damage control surgery and must be shifted to ICU for further \nresuscitation. 177 \nSold by @itachibot Damage control surgery is minimal intervention done to stabilize the patient and do the definite \nsurgery later. It centers on coordinating staged operative interventions with periods of aggressive \nresuscitation to salvage trauma patients sustaining major injuries. 3 Phases : Phase I (Initial Exploration) - This phase consists of an initial operative exploration to attain rapid control of active \nhemorrhage and contamination. Phase II (Secondary Resuscitation) - This phase focuses on secondary resuscitation to correct hypothermia, \ncoagulopathy, and acidosis. Phase III (Definitive Operation) - It consists of planned re-exploration and definitive repair of injuries. This phase typically \noccurs 48 to 72 hours following initial and after successful secondary resuscitation. Pringle's manoeuvre can be performed to decrease the active haemorrhage from the liver in a liver \nlaceration. It is done by applying pressure on the portal triad at the Foramen of Winslow. The \npressure can be applied either digitally or with the use of a soft clamp. Rapid control of the vessels entering the porta hepatis can be obtained by compressing them in \nthe free edge of the lesser omentum. Porta hepatis is a deep, transverse fissure that is situated on the inferior surface of the right \nlobe of the liver. Structures entering at porta hepatis: • Portal vein • Hepatic artery • Hepatic nervous plexus Structures exiting the porta hepatis: • Right and left hepatic bile ducts • Lymphatics The images attached below shows the porta hepatis and the gif demonstrates the pringles \nmanoeuvre. 178 \nSold by @itachibot 179 \nSold by @itachibot 4 P's in the management of liver injuries are: • Push- Compression of the edges of the laceration • Pringle- Applying pressure on the portal triad • Plug the defects with silicon tubes • Pack- Apply packs in and around the liver to arrest bleeding General guidelines for the management of blunt trauma to the liver: • Patients who are haemodynamically unstable will require an immediate laparotomy for damage \ncontrol resuscitation. • For the patient who is haemodynamically stable, imaging by CT should be performed to further \nevaluate the nature of the injury. • Most patients with a blunt liver injury who are haemodynamically stable can be managed \nconservatively. • The indication for discontinuing conservative treatment is the development of haemodynamic \ninstability, evidence of ongoing blood loss despite correction of any underlying coagulopathy and \nthe development of signs of generalised peritonitis. • Interventional radiology has an important role in the management of liver trauma and \nembolisation to control hepatic artery bleeding is safe and effective in a stable patient with no \nevidence of hollow viscus perforation. 180 \nSold by @itachibot Breast - Anatomy, Congenital and Benign Diseases",
