It is an extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney \ndisease. 1014 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical features of SAH: • Sudden-onset severe headache (thunderclap headache) • Rapid onset vomiting • Confusion or a lowered level of consciousness • Seizures • Meningitic features of neck stiffness and photophobia often develop over hours. The most common cause is trauma and is managed conservatively. The second most common \ncause is a rupture of a berry aneurysm. CT scan is the investigation of choice. A hyperattenuating material is seen filling the subarachnoid \nspace. Most commonly this is apparent around the circle of Willis, on account of the majority of \nberry aneurysms occurring in this region. A lumbar puncture should be performed if the CT scan fails to establish the diagnosis of SAH. It \nwill show xanthochromic CSF. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) is attributed to vasospasm of the cerebral \nvasculature typically developing 3–10 days following ictus. It is the main cause of a poor outcome. Management: • Endovascular treatment (\"coiling\") is generally preferred over craniotomy and clipping for \naneurysms amenable to this approach. • The combination of induced hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (Triple-H therapy) is \noften utilized to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage \n(SAH). Note: The combination of subarachnoid hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage (subhyaloid) is \nknown as Terson syndrome. 1015 \nSold by @itachibot",

It is attributed to ischemia resulting \nfrom reactive cerebral vasospasm. Patients with a larger blood load (in the subarachnoid space) \nare at higher risk of vasospasm.

      "explanation": "Bulbocavernosus reflex is the first reflex to return after the spinal shock has resolved. It is elicited by squeezing the glans penis in males and applying pressure to the clitoris or pulling \nthe Foleys catheter in females. Any of these will lead to anal sphincter contraction. Spinal shock is a condition of transient physiologic reflex depression of spinal cord function \n(motor, sensory, tone, reflexes) below the level of injury. It usually results from a high-impact, \ndirect trauma to the spinal cord. When the level of injury is above T6, it can result in \nhemodynamic changes such as hypotension and bradycardia (due to loss of sympathetic tone and \nunopposed parasympathetic function). The resolution of spinal shock occurs over a period of days to months, when the areflexia slowly \ntransitions to hyperreflexia and spasticity. Reflexes return sequentially rather than \nsimultaneously. The resolution of the somatic component of spinal shock is classically signaled by \nthe return of the bulbocavernosus reflex, a polysynaptic cutaneous spinal reflex (mediated by the \nconus medullaris) which is then followed by monosynaptic deep tendon reflexes (e.g. ankle jerk). 1017 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The use of antiepileptics in late post-traumatic seizure (PTS) patients is recommended. Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are seizures that result from traumatic brain injury (TBI). They are \nclassified into early and late. Early PTS occurs within 1 week and late PTS occurs after 1 week of \ntrauma (Option C). Early PTS are acute symptomatic events, attributed to a direct reaction to injury and hemorrhage. \nRisk factors for early PTS are: • Younger age (especially &lt;5 years) • Moderate to severe head injury (measured by GCS) • Acute intracerebral hematoma • Subdural / Subarachnoid hemorrhage • Depressed skull fractures • Diffuse cerebral edema • History of alcohol abuse • Penetrating head injury Late PTS usually occurs due to underlying permanent structural and physiologic changes within \nthe brain. Patients with late PTS may develop post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). It refers to recurrent \nand unprovoked PTS that occur at least 1 week after TBI. Risk factors for PTE are: • Early PTS • Severe head injury • Older age (especially &gt;65 years) • Focal neurological deficit • Intracranial hemorrhage • Intracranial infection • Abnormalities on EEG • Alcohol-related head injury Prolonged seizures (30 to 60 minutes) can cause secondary brain injury, not primary (Option B). \nHence, it is imperative to control acute seizures as soon as possible. The initiation of antiepileptics in early PTS patients is to prevent damage due to seizures \nthemselves. It does not reduce the likelihood of developing PTE (Option D). For patients who \ndevelop late PTS, because of the high risk of seizure recurrence after the first episode of late PTS, \nthe use of antiepileptic medication is recommended even after a single late seizure episode. The \nlong-term sequelae of head injury are headache, raised ICP, impaired short-term memory, lack of \nconcentration, emotional disinhibition, and depression. 1020 \nSold by @itachibot Prophylaxis for PTS is indicated in patients at risk of early PTS, for 7 days and is stopped without \ntapering the dose if no seizures have occurred during this duration.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be avoided in patients with basilar skull fractures \ndue to the risk of pneumocephalus. Signs in basilar skull fractures: • Hemotympanum: Pooling of blood behind the tympanic membrane, associated with fracture of \nthe temporal bone. It is one of the earliest signs of basilar fracture. • Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes): Pooling of blood surrounding the eyes, associated with \nfractures of the anterior cranial fossa. • Retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign): Pooled blood behind the ears in the mastoid \nregion is associated with fractures to the middle cranial fossa. • CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea: “Halo” sign, a double-ring pattern described with CSF-containing \nbloody fluid from the ear or nose, when dripped onto paper or linen. Battle sign and raccoon eyes are both typically not present during the initial evaluation and are \ndelayed by 6 hrs up to 3 days after head injury. CSF leaks may be delayed hours to days after the initial trauma. Fluid suspicious for CSF is \nconfirmed by testing for 2 transferrin. Most CSF leaks are conservatively managed. Persistent \nleaks &gt;7 days have a heightened risk of meningitis and are often surgically repaired. Nasopharyngeal airways and nasogastric tube insertion are relatively contraindicated in basilar \nskull fractures due to the risk for intracranial placement. NIPPV is avoided due to the risk for \npneumocephalus. The image below shows the 'battle' sign. 1021 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows 'racoon' eyes. The image below shows pneumocephalus.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history of fall and anterograde amnesia with no focal neurologic deficits points towards \nthe diagnosis of concussion. Observation followed by a gradual return to play is the current \nrecommendation for a concussion. It is defined as an alteration of consciousness as a result of closed head injury. It is the most \ncommon type of traumatic brain injury, which can result from vehicle accidents, falls, sports \ninjuries, etc. Clinical features of concussion include: • Anterograde amnesia/post-traumatic amnesia - a hallmark of a concussion. In this type of \namnesia, the events following the injury cannot be recalled. • Confusion • Headache • Dizziness • Nausea • Vomiting Observation in the emergency department is essential following the clinical exam to look for \nalterations in mental status or focal neurological signs. The presence of either of which may signal \nmore serious underlying pathology (e.g., intracranial bleeding). Following discharge, the patients are advised to not return to contact sports e.g., football, boxing, \netc. which carries the risk of further injury, for at least a week. Then, there should be a gradual, \nstepwise increase in physical activity. Option A: There are no focal neurological deficits to warrant an NCCT of the brain. Option B: Immediate discharge and return to intense physical activity following mild TBI are \ninappropriate. Because those who are symptomatic after a head injury, are vulnerable to a repeat \nimpact. Due to disturbed cerebral autoregulation, even a minor second injury may trigger a form \nof malignant cerebral edema refractory to treatment. Option D: Admission to the intensive care unit for intracranial pressure monitoring would be \nappropriate in patients with severe TBI, for which elevated intracranial pressure is a serious \nconcern due to brain edema and/or bleeding. Severe TBI is characterized by a GCS  8. Here the \npatient has a GCS of &gt;14. 1024 \nSold by @itachibot 1025 \nSold by @itachibot Oral Cavity & Salivary glands",
