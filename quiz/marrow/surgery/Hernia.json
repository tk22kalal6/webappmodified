Obstruction is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal \ndistension and obstipation. Features of obstruction along with vascular compromise is seen in \nstrangluation. Strangulation occurs in 1% to 3% of groin hernias. It is more common at the \nextremes of life. Most strangulated hernias are indirect inguinal hernias. However, femoral hernias have the \nhighest rate of strangulation (15% to 20%) of all hernias, and it is, therefore, recommended that \nall femoral hernias be repaired at the time of discovery. Tenderness is the first sign of \nstrangulation. The first step is the correction of hypovolemia. The treatment of choice is immediate surgery. The \nfundus is opened first during surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "651 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario of a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery is suggestive of a \ndirect hernia, for which Lichtenstein mesh repair is the appropriate surgical method for its \nmanagement. The contents of a direct hernia protrude outward, forward, and medial to the inferior epigastric \nartery and the deep inguinal ring. Whereas, the contents of an indirect hernia protrude lateral to \nthe inferior epigastric artery. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the deep inguinal \nring obliquely towards the superficial inguinal ring and then to the scrotum. A direct hernia protrudes through the Hesselbach triangle, which is a zone of weakness for direct \nhernias. A Lichtenstein mesh repair is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating an \ninguinal hernia. It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. It is an anterior \ntension-free mesh repair that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prosthetic \nnonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair. Other surgical methods used for the repair of an inguinal hernia are: • Bassini repair - It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. In this method, a \nmesh is not used. It is associated with a high recurrence and is not used frequently now. It is used \nonly in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It is \nperformed by suturing the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeurotic \narches/conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament. • Shouldice repair - It is a multilayered repair, where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is \nstrengthened by continuous sutures. It involves double-breasting of the transversalis fascia. It is \nassociated with a very low recurrence rate. • Gilbert repair (plug and patch repair) - It is an extension of Lichtenstein’s original mesh repair \nand has now become the most commonly performed primary anterior inguinal hernia repair. In \nthis technique, a cone-shaped plug of polypropylene mesh is used. It is deployed like an \nupside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia • McVay repair (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, large \nindirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femoral 652 \nSold by @itachibot hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper's \nligament. • Stoppa-Rives repair - It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In this \nmethod, a sub-umbilical midline incision is given to place a large mesh into the preperitoneal \nspace. • Herniotomy - It is used to treat inguinal hernia in a child which occurs due to the presence of \na patent processus vaginalis. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "With smaller defects, the mesh does not need to be sutured in Stoppa's repair. This is based on Pascal's law. Pascal’s law states that any additional pressure exerted on an \nenclosed fluid mass is transmitted equally in all directions.The abdomen is an enclosed space and \nintra-abdominal pressure is distributed equally over the mesh, thereby keeping the mesh in place. Stoppa's repair is an open preperitoneal mesh repair primarily indicated for large, recurrent, \nbilateral hernias. In Stoppa’s mesh repair, a large piece of mesh is placed in the retro muscular space, over the \nposterior rectus sheath or peritoneum. This mesh is not sutured in patients with small defects \nbecause it is held in place by intra-abdominal pressure (Pascal’s law). This allows the eventual \nincorporation of the mesh with the surrounding tissues. Alternatively, in larger defects, the mesh \ncan be secured laterally with several sutures.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a lightweight mesh with large pores. Lightweight meshes generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign body \nreaction and decreased inflammatory response, which results in better tissue incorporation, \nincreased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain. Meshes with large pores exhibit less inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and scar bridging, \nwhich allows increased soft tissue ingrowth. They have greater elasticity and flexibility and also \nshrink less resulting in lesser adhesions, better tissue incorporation, and decreased patient \ndiscomfort and pain. So the best mesh type among the given options is lightweight mesh with \nlarge pores. Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological depending on their composition. Synthetic meshes are made from polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). PTFE meshes are hydrophobic with a lower risk of adhesion. Biological meshes are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have lesser \ncomplications. But due to poor collagen deposition and absorption, they rapidly lose mechanical \nstrength and hence their use is restricted to infected environments. Note: To promote better tissue integration, a composite mesh was developed which combines the \nattributes of polypropylene and PTFE by layering the two substances on top of one another.

It is most commonly injured within the inguinal canal in open \nhernia repair due to traction or thermal injury. 654 \nSold by @itachibot The iliohypogastric nerve carries the sensory supply from the suprapubic area. Injury to this nerve \nin the right iliac fossa rarely causes sensory disturbances, as the suprapubic area has a rich nerve \nsupply from other sources too. If the nerve is severed above the anterior superior iliac spine, it can \nlead to the weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal resulting in direct inguinal hernia. \nIliohypogastric nerve can also get injured following appendicectomy. Injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve results in loss of sensation in the skin of \nthe scrotum of males, and loss of sensation of the mons pubis and labia majora in females.

Most sliding hernias are variants of indirect inguinal hernias. \nThe primary danger associated with a sliding hernia is the failure to recognize the visceral \ncomponent of the hernia sac resulting in injury to the bowel or bladder. Option A: A lumbar hernia is a posterolateral body wall hernia where the bowel, omentum, or \npre-peritoneal fat herniates through the lumbar triangles. Option C: A Spigelian hernia occurs through slit-like defects in the anterior abdominal wall \nadjacent to the semilunar line. Most spigelian hernias occur in the lower abdomen where the \nposterior sheath is deficient. It is also called “spontaneous lateral ventral hernia” or “hernia of the \nsemilunar line”. Option D: A pantaloon hernia occurs when both a direct and an indirect hernia develop on the \nsame side of the groin. The hernia is named pantaloon because the two hernia sacs are divided by \nepigastric vessels, and so they look like a pair of pants.",
