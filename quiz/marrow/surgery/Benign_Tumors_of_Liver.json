      "explanation": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is more common in females. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumour. The infantile variety is benign, \nwhile the adult variety is malignant. It may undergo malignant degeneration into angiosarcoma. It is related to exposure to vinyl chloride and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). It can affect the lungs, liver, and bones. In the liver, it manifests as multiple bilateral hepatic \nmasses. Extrahepatic metastases occur in approximately 25% of patients. Liver failure is a fatal \ncomplication. Hypervascular enhancement is observed on CECT. A percutaneous biopsy can help differentiate \nfrom other tumours. Factor VIII staining differentiates it from other nonvascular tumours. Treatment is total hepatectomy with liver transplantation.",

      "explanation": "The given CECT abdomen shows a well-defined hypodense lesion in the liver with asymmetrical \nnodular peripheral enhancement which is characteristic of hemangioma. Hemangioma is a benign tumor composed of increased proliferation of blood vessels. It is the \nmost common benign tumour of the liver and is mainly seen in women at a mean age of 45 years. Small capillary hemangiomas are of no clinical significance. They are usually solitary, &lt;5 cm in \ndiameter, with equal occurrence in the right and left halves of the liver. However, giant \nhemangiomas of diameter &gt;5 cm require attention. They are most commonly asymptomatic and incidentally found during imaging studies. Large \ncompressive masses may cause vague upper abdominal symptoms. The appearance of hepatic \nhemangioma in a contrast-enhanced CT scan is as follows: • Non-contrast phase: Well-defined hypodense lesion • Arterial phase: Peripheral nodular enhancement • Washout phase: Homogenous enhancement The image given below shows early phase with peripheral high attenuation (a) and late phase with \nhomogenous high attenuation (b). 708 \nSold by @itachibot",

In hemangioma, an increase in uptake is observed in blood pool studies such as 99mTc-labelled \nred cells and appear as photopenic regions. The nuclear imaging techniques for the diagnosis of \nhemangiomas are used only when high-quality CT and MRI are unavailable. CECT is the investigation of choice wherein a typical peripheral nodular enhancement pattern is \nseen. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hemangiomas are hypointense on T1-weighted images and \nhyperintense on T2-weighted images. The below MRI image shows the light bulb sign seen in hemangioma of the liver. 709 \nSold by @itachibot Percutaneous biopsy is potentially dangerous and inaccurate and, therefore, not recommended. Isotope scans used for the investigation of hepatobiliary disease are: • Technetium-99m colloid scan - parenchymal diseases of the liver, such as cirrhosis and alcoholic \nhepatitis • Technetium-99m hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan - acute cholecystitis and \ncongenital biliary atresia • Technetium-99m sulphur colloid scan - focal nodular hyperplasia",

Kasai procedure or hepatoportoenterostomy is done for biliary atresia, and not \nin Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Rarely a rapidly enlarging hemangioma can cause thrombocytopenia and disseminated \nintravascular coagulation (indicated by the elevated D-dimer) because platelets and other clotting \nfactors are being used up within the tumour. This is called Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. LFT and tumour markers are normal in a hemangioma. Large hemangiomas in children can result \nin congestive heart failure secondary to arteriovenous shunting and they require medical \nmanagement.

They are usually seen in young women \nbetween 20-40 years of age and are typically solitary. Prolonged oral contraceptive use is a clear \nrisk factor. Clinical presentation may be abdominal pain. Histological studies show cords of benign hepatocytes containing excessive glycogen and fat, \ngiving a congested or vacuolated appearance.

Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates a \nwell-circumscribed and vascular solid tumor.
