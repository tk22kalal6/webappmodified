      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Most cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are unilateral. It is bilateral in only 30% of the \nindividuals. DVT refers to thrombosis of the deep venous system. Caused by: • Postoperative thrombosis (most common cause) • Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) • After childbirth • Immobility Sites: • Pelvic veins—common • Leg veins—common in femoral and popliteal veins (common on the left side). Fever is the earliest symptom, which is also most commonly accompanied by pain and tenderness \nin the calf and thigh (option C). The following signs could be elicited: • Positive Homan's sign: Resistance of calf muscles on passive foreceful dorsiflexion of the foot. • Mose's sign: Gentle squeezing of the lower part of the calf from side to side is painful. • Neuhof's sign: Thickening and deep tenderness seen on deep palpation of the calf muscles. Sometimes, the thrombus may get dislodged and present as pulmonary thromboembolism (option \nD) with features of dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and chest pain. Clinical features are unreliable for making a definitive diagnosis (option A), and a venous Doppler \nis the best modality for confirming DVT. It reveals a non-compressible dilated vein. The likelihood \nof pulmonary embolism can be predicted using modified Wells criteria. Patients with DVT should be immediately started with subcutaneous low molecular weight \nheparin (LMWH). If contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or thrombocytopenia-related \nconditions, they should be started on fondaparinux (indirect factor Xa inhibitor) or bivalirudin \n(direct thrombin inhibitor). Anticoagulants should be administered for a minimum period of 3 1214 \nSold by @itachibot months. Vena cava filters are used in patients with bleeding risks (like hemophilia).",

      "explanation": "The patient is having phlegmasia alba dolens also known milk leg or white leg. It is due to \nileofemoral deep vein thrombosis. It is usually seen in pregnant women and in individuals at risk of developing deep vein \nthrombosis. They typically present with painful, oedematous, and pale lower limb that blanches to \ntouch. The lack of cyanosis differentiates this entity from phlegmasia cerulea dolens. In phlegmasia alba dolens, the thrombosis involves only major deep venous channels of the \nextremity, thus sparing collateral veins. The venous drainage is decreased but still present. In phlegmasia cerulea dolens, the thrombosis extends to collateral veins, resulting in severe \nvenous congestion with massive fluid sequestration and more significant edema. Both phlegmasia cerulea dolens and phlegmasia alba dolens results from acute massive deep vein \nthrombosis and can be complicated by venous gangrene. Edema of pregnancy does not present with pain in the lower limbs but edema due to pressure \nexerted by the gravid uterus on the iliac veins. 1215 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Heparin, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more effective for prophylaxis of \nDVT in patients who have undergone major surgeries where early ambulation is not possible. The choice of prophylaxis depends on the type of surgery, trauma, and duration of postoperative \nimmobilisation. Major trauma, abdominal and orthopaedic surgeries warrant a longer duration of \npostoperative immobilisation. So, the pharmacological method is preferred in these situations. Mechanical methods are advised in patients who are expected to be up and walking within 24 to \n48 hours such as after minor trauma. The simplest method is for the patient to ambulate. The \nactivation of the calf pump mechanism is an effective means of prophylaxis. Additionally, compression stockings are advised. It can reduce the risk of DVT by exerting \ngraduated pressure on the leg, with the pressure being greatest at the ankle. Advantages of LMWH over unfractionated heparin: • LMWH has a longer plasma half-life and significantly higher bioavailability. • The consistent bioavailability and clearance of LMWH do not require monitoring of aPTT or \nanti-factor Xa activity. • Dosing is merely based on the patient’s weight. • There is a more predictable anticoagulant response than with unfractionated heparin. LMWH inhibits factor Xa and not IIa activity, with the ratio of anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIa \nactivity ranging from 1:1 to 4:1.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Superficial venous thrombosis is not a risk factor for developing varicose veins because the deep \nvenous system is not affected and there is no increased stasis of blood. Varicose veins are defined as dilated, usually tortuous, subcutaneous veins &gt;3 mm in diameter \nmeasured in the upright position with demonstrable reflux. Important risk factors for varicose veins are: • Sex – Females &gt; Males • Age – increases with age • Pregnancy (especially multiparity) • Family history • Body mass and height: Increasing BMI (obesity) and height are associated with a high prevalence \nof varicose veins. There is inconclusive evidence regarding the increased prevalence of varicose veins in smokers, \npatients who suffer constipation, and occupations that involve prolonged standing. 1216 \nSold by @itachibot Primary varicose veins are due to genetic or developmental defects in the vein wall that causes \ndiminished elasticity and valvular incompetence. Secondary varicose veins arise from destruction or dysfunction of valves caused by trauma, DVT, \nAV fistula, non-traumatic proximal venous obstruction (pregnancy, pelvic tumor).",

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is migratory thrombophlebitis. It is a paraneoplastic syndrome that is also known as Trousseau’s syndrome or Trousseau's sign of \nmalignancy. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of localised thrombosis of the superficial \nveins of limbs. It can lead to tender and erythematous rashes. Migratory thrombophlebitis is seen in: • Pancreatic cancer (most common) • Lung cancer • Gastrointestinal cancer • Ovarian cancer • Prostate cancer • Lymphoma Note: Trousseau’s sign is seen in hypocalcemia where there is an involuntary contraction of the \nmuscles of the hand and wrist when a blood pressure cuff is placed on the arm and inflated to \n20mm of Hg above systolic blood pressure.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The patient has axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis. Hypercoagulable states lead to secondary \naxillary vein thrombosis. Axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT) is of 2 types. 1224 \nSold by @itachibot Primary ASVT occurs as a result of compression of the subclavian vein in the costoclavicular \nspace by repeated contraction of muscles that surround the thoracic outlet. There is repeated \ncompression and traumatization to the vein. This leads to the formation of clots. It is also known \nas: • Paget-Schrotter Syndrome • Venous thoracic outlet syndrome • Effort thrombosis Secondary ASVT occurs due to venous injury by indwelling central venous catheters, external \ntrauma or pacemaker wires. It is also seen in hypercoagulable states. Symptoms and signs include pain, edema, and cyanosis of the upper extremity. Significant \nsuperficial venous distension can be seen in arm, forearm, shoulder and anterior chest wall. Doppler study is the investigation of choice. Anticoagulation is initiated once ASVT is diagnosed \nto prevent pulmonary embolism.In severe cases, thrombolytic therapy is done using tissue \nplasminogen activator (rtPA) or streptokinase. Adjuvant procedures following thrombolytic therapy may include balloon angioplasty for residual \nvenous narrowing and cervical or first rib resection for thoracic outlet abnormalities.",

      "explanation": "The likely diagnosis, in this case, is a venous ulcer secondary to the varicose vein. \nRevascularization is not a part of the management of venous ulcers. Venous ulcers are due to chronic venous insufficiency and are particularly seen in the area \nbetween the muscles of the calf and ankle. It has a sloping edge and the floor contains granulation \ntissue covered by slough and exudate. Marjolin’s ulcer is a type of squamous cell carcinoma seen \nin chronic long-standing venous ulcers. Management of venous ulcers: • Bisgaard's regimen • Education • Elevation of the affected limb to reduce the edema • Elastic compression stockings - The ideal interface pressure in venous ulceration is 35-40 \nmmHg. • Evaluation • 4 layer bandaging system comprising of: • Orthopedic wool • Cotton crepe • Elastic bandage - first compressive layer • Cohesive bandage - second compressive layer • Antibiotics are given only if the wound is infected. • Regular dressing. 1226 \nSold by @itachibot • Medical management by oral pentoxifylline is considered which helps in reducing the viscosity \nand improving circulation. • Surgery - Ulcer excision with pinch mesh grafting has a good outcome and helps in preventing \nrecurrence.",

      "explanation": "The gradual filling of veins from below upwards indicates the perforator incompetence. Brodie \nTrendelenberg test is performed to test for the incompetence of the saphenofemoral valve and the \ncommunicating system. 1. Trendelenburg’s test - Lay the patient down and elevate the leg. Empty the vessels and tie a \ntourniquet below the SFJ. Ask the patient to stand up: • Trendelenburg’s test part ll - Here the tourniquet is not released. A gradual filling from below to \nupwards indicates perforator incompetence. 1227 \nSold by @itachibot • Trendelenburg’s test part l - Here the tourniquet is released. A rapid filling from above shows the \nsaphenofemoral incompetence. 2. Morrisey’s cough impulse: the patient is asked to cough. A cough impulse at the \nsaphenofemoral junction indicates SFJ incompetence. 3. Schwartz test: If a thrill is felt at SFJ on tapping over the incompetent vein, indicates SFJ \nincompetence. 4. Modified Perthes test: A tourniquet is tied below SFJ and the patient is asked to walk. An \nincrease in pain and prominence of dilated veins indicate DVT. 5. Fegan’s method - Mark the places of excessive bulges within the varicosities. Ask the patient to \nlie down and empty the varicose vessels. Palpate along the marked area to look for gaps and pits \nin the deep fascia, which indicates perforator incompetence. 1228 \nSold by @itachibot Lymphatic Diseases",
