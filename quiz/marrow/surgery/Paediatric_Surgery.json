      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "111 \nSold by @itachibot The above X-ray chest shows intra-thoracic bowel shadows along with mediastinal shift suggestive \nof congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The common clinical presentation is as follows: • Respiratory distress • Dextrocardia • Scaphoid abdomen Prenatal diagnosis is done by ultrasonography. Lung-to-head ratio (LHR) is used to assess severity \nin patients with left-sided CDH. An LHR value of &lt;1 is associated with a very poor prognosis, \nwhereas an LHR &gt;1.4 predicts a more favourable outcome. Option A: Hyaline membrane disease is a syndrome in premature infants caused by \ndevelopmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the \nlungs. Option B: Meconium aspiration syndrome is the aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, \nwhich can occur before, during or immediately after birth. Meconium is the first intestinal \ndischarge from newborns, a viscous, dark-green substance composed of intestinal epithelial cells, \nlanugo, mucus, and intestinal secretions. Option D: During normal delivery, the compression of the rib cage while passing through the \nmother's vaginal canal helps to remove fluid from the lungs. However, newborns who are \ndelivered via cesarean birth may have excess fluid in the lungs and therefore be hypoxic and \ndevelop transient tachypnea.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The posterolateral variant of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is known as Bochdalek \nhernia while the anteromedian variant is called Morgagni hernia. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia results from the failure of closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal \nin the developing fetus. Typically in CDH, there is a left-sided posterolateral diaphragmatic defect allowing herniation of \nabdominal viscera into the chest. 80% of CDH develops on the left side. 112 \nSold by @itachibot The following sequence of events in CDH leads to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia are the most important prognostic factors in \ncongenital diaphragmatic hernia. Other poor prognostic indicators in CDH : • The presence of liver in the thoracic cavity • Early respiratory distress, within 24 h after birth • Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation • Herniation to the contralateral lung (right-sided hernia) • Treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia: 113 \nSold by @itachibot Variable period of time (24-72 hours) is to be allowed for stabilization before surgical repair. \nImmediate respiratory support should be provided, including rapid endotracheal intubation and \nsedation. Bag and mask ventilation is contraindicated in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia \nbecause it causes distension of the stomach which in turn may limit the expansion of the \nalready hypoplastic lung. During surgery, the viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in \nthe diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a \nhernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of repair.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Early respiratory distress, within 6 hours of birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. Features of a Bochdalek hernia: • Respiratory distress is a cardinal sign in infants with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). • Early respiratory distress, within 6 hr after birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. • Children with CDH may also have a scaphoid abdomen and increased chest wall diameter. • Bowel sounds may also be heard in the chest, with a bilateral decrease in breath sounds. • The point of maximal cardiac impulse may be displaced away from the side of a hernia if \na mediastinal shift has occurred. • Retroperitoneal fat, left kidney, spleen or only the omentum commonly herniates through the \ndefect. If the defect is large, most abdominal contents including stomach may herniate. Diagnosis: • Chest radiography and passage of a nasal gastric tube confirm the diagnosis. • CDH can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography (between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation) • High-speed fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further define the lesion. Ultrasonography findings: • Polyhydramnios • Chest mass • Mediastinal shift • Gastric bubble or a liver in the thoracic cavity • Fetal hydrops 115 \nSold by @itachibot Differential diagnosis: • Eventration • Cystic lung lesion (pulmonary sequestration or cystic adenomatoid Malformation) • Group B streptococcal sepsis: associated with delayed onset of symptoms and a CDH often on \nthe right side. • Pneumothorax: always occurs on contralateral to the side of CDH. Treatment: Variable period of time (24-72 hours) to allow for stabilization before surgical repair The viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm \nis closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a hernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of \nrepair. Conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and \nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the 3 main strategies to support respiratory \nfailure in the newborn with CDH. Good relative indicators of stability are as follows: • Requirement for conventional ventilation only • Low peak inspiratory pressure • Fio2 &lt;50 If the defect is too large, a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) patch is used.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Explanation: The given clinical history with an x-ray showing a triple bubble sign is suggestive of jejunal \natresia. The next best step is to perform a contrast study to localize the site of obstruction. Small bowel atresias present with intestinal obstruction soon after birth. • Bilious vomiting is the dominant feature in jejunal atresia • Abdominal distension is more prominent in ileal atresia 116 \nSold by @itachibot A small amount of pale meconium may be passed, despite the atresia. Plain abdomen radiographs in a jejunal/ileal atresia case will show multiple air-fluid levels and \ndilated loops. They don't reliably distinguish small and large bowels in neonates and hence \ncontrast studies are often required to localize the obstruction. Water-soluble enemas (Gastrogaffin, Hypaque) are particularly useful in differentiating atresia \nfrom meconium ileus and Hirschsprung disease. Contrast studies also help to rule out distal \nintestinal obstruction and occasionally may act therapeutically to relieve obstructions. In most cases of jejunal/ileal atresia, the distal end of the dilated proximal small bowel is resected \nand a primary end-to-end anastomosis is done. If the proximal bowel is extremely dilated, it may \nneed to be tapered to the distal bowel before anastomosis. Other options: Option A: CT is not recommended for neonates owing to the harmful effects of radiation. Option C: USG abdomen does not help to localize the site of obstruction and is more useful in the \ndiagnosis of intussusception, where there is an abdominal mass. Option D: Explorative laparotomy is not done for diagnosing intestinal atresias.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. A rectal biopsy is the gold standard \nfor the diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease. A rectal biopsy 2 cm above the dentate line is the ideal area for a biopsy. Hirschsprung’s disease is a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells \nin the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus and submucosal (Meissner) plexus. Most infants present with \nabdominal distention and bilious emesis with failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours \nof life. The initial investigation is a contrast enema. The area between the dilated and contracted \nsegments is referred to as the transition zone. The affected part shows the absence of ganglion \ncells and hypertrophy of nerve trunks in the rectal biopsy. Other investigations for Hirschsprung’s disease include: • Water-soluble contrast enema - shows the presence of contracted aganglionic rectum, transition \nzone, and a dilated normally innervated colon. • Anorectal manometry - shows the failure of the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows: • Swenson procedure, where aganglionic bowel is removed and a coloanal anastomosis is \nperformed. • Duhamel procedure, where the aganglionic rectal stump is left in place and the ganglionated \nnormal colon is pulled posterior. • Soave procedure, where endorectal mucosal dissection is done within the aganglionic distal \nrectum. The ganglionated normal colon is pulled through the remnant muscular cuff, and a \ncoloanal anastomosis is performed.",

      "explanation": "Meckel’s diverticulum is a true diverticulum, which extends from the antimesenteric side of the \nsmall bowel. The diverticula which contain all the layers of the intestine are called true \ndiverticula. Meckel’s diverticulum is caused by a failure of normal regression of the vitelline duct that \ndevelops during weeks 5-7 of gestation.

Meckel's diverticulum can be the lead point for ileoileal or ileocolic intussusception. A bleeding Meckel's diverticulum may be confirmed by a 99 mTc-pertechnetate isotope scan to \ndetect ectopic gastric mucosa. Surgical treatment is the definitive therapy for Meckel’s diverticulum.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Omphalocele is usually associated with other congenital anomalies whereas gastroschisis is rarely \nassociated with other congenital anomalies. Omphalocele refers to a congenital defect of the abdominal wall in which the bowel and solid \nviscera are covered by the peritoneum and amniotic membrane. • During normal development of the human embryo, the midgut herniates outward through the \numbilical ring and continues to grow. • Between 10th-12th week of gestation, the midgut returns to the coelomic cavity and undergoes \nproper rotation and fixation, along with the closure of the umbilical ring. • If the intestine fails to return, the infant is born with the abdominal contents protruding directly \nthrough the umbilical ring, with an intact sac covering the abdominal viscera, termed an \nomphalocele. 119 \nSold by @itachibot The sac is composed of an outer layer of amnion and an inner layer of peritoneum. It is seen in \nomphalocele and not in gastroschisis. Omphalocele can vary from a small defect with intestinal \ncontents to a giant omphalocele in which the abdominal wall defect measures 4 cm or more in \ndiameter. It may even contain liver. Omphalocele occurs in association with special syndromes such as: • There is a 60% to 70% incidence of associated anomalies, especially cardiac anomalies (20–40% \nof cases) and chromosomal abnormalities. • Exstrophy of the cloaca (vesicointestinal fissure) • The Beckwith-Wiedemann constellation of anomalies (macroglossia, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, \nand visceromegaly and omphalocele) • The Cantrell’s pentalogy (lower thoracic wall malformations like cleft sternum, ectopia cordis, \nepigastric omphalocele, anterior midline diaphragmatic hernia, and cardiac anomalies).",

      "explanation": "The given clinical history of lower back pain, mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the \ngroin and pain on passive extension of the ipsilateral hip is suggestive of a psoas abscess. Psoas abscess is a retroperitoneal abscess, caused due to various etiologies. Previously, \ntuberculosis of the spine was the most common cause secondary to spreading infection from the \ndigestive or urinary tract, which can cause psoas abscess. Nowadays, Crohn’s disease is the most \ncommon cause. Patients present with flank pain, fever and chills, malaise and weight loss. They \ncan have referred pain to the hip, groin or knee. When the swelling extends across the groin and \nbelow the inguinal ligament along the course of the iliopsoas, it becomes cross fluctuant across the \ninguinal ligament. Imaging is done by a CT scan, which shows a low-density mass with surrounding inflammation \nand infiltration of surrounding fat and gas or air-fluid levels. 123 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment is done by percutaneous CT-guided drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Other options: Option A: Pyelonephritis is usually associated with a history of urinary tract infection and sudden \nonset of pain in the flank and hypochondrium, not the lumbar region. Option C: Appendicitis (retrocaecal) can present with pain on passive extension of the hip (psoas \nsign), but the presence of a mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin makes it \nan unlikely diagnosis. Option D: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency condition presenting with sudden onset pain \nin the scrotum, groin and lower abdomen, tenderness, redness and edema of the scrotal skin.",

      "explanation": "124 \nSold by @itachibot A soft, painless, brilliantly transilluminant, fluctuating mass found in the posterior part of the \nneck in a child, is most likely to be a cystic hygroma. Cystic hygroma is a lymph-filled sac that results from the obstruction of the lymph vessels during \ntheir development. It is most commonly present in the posterior triangle of the neck. The mass \nmay be apparent at birth or may appear in early childhood due to the increased accumulation of \nlymph. Since the sac is filled with lymph, it is soft, fluctuating, and brilliantly transilluminant. Treatment: • Aspiration of the contents, followed by excision once the sac or capsule gets thickened by fibrous \ntissue. • Single cysts can be treated with sclerosing therapy. Commonly used sclerosants include OK–432 \nor Picibanil, which is a mixture of group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain, pure ethanol, interferon \nalpha-2a, and doxycycline. • Complete excision is done in case of multiple cysts. Option B: A branchial cleft cyst also presents as soft fluctuant swelling. It is present in the anterior \nneck and at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Option C: Lipoma is less commonly seen in children. The swelling is non-fluctuant and when \npalpated, the edge slips under the finger. This is known as the slip sign. Option D: Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in children with infections of the parotid and upper \nrespiratory tract infections. On palpation, they are firm and non-fluctuant.",

Ultrasound examination is the investigation of choice for this condition. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS) is characterized by abnormal thickening of the \npylorus muscles in the stomach leading to gastric outlet obstruction. First-born male infants are at \nthe highest risk. Infants usually present with • Projectile, non-bilious vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction, most commonly between 3 and \n6 weeks of age. • Olive-shaped mass palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. • Visible peristalsis after feeding, moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. • Metabolic abnormalities include hypokalemic, hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis with \nparadoxical aciduria. Ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis \n(CHPS) in the majority of cases. The diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis are a muscle thickness \nof  4 mm and a pyloric length of  16 mm. Ultrasound signs seen in Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis are: • Target sign (Hypoechoic thickened pyloric muscle with a hyperechoic central mucosa) • Cervix sign • Nipple sign. • Antral nipple sign The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality has to be corrected before \nproceeding to surgery.
