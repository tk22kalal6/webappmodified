It is the most common cause of nipple discharge in \nnon-lactating women. This condition is associated with smoking and diabetes. The initial stage of \nthis disease consists of dilatation of one or more lactiferous ducts. These ducts get filled with \nstagnant brown or green-colored secretions. In the later stages, the accumulation of fluid in the \nlactiferous ducts leads to infection and inflammation, causing periductal mastitis. Patients may \npresent with nipple discharge, abscess, fistula, or nipple retraction.

Non-lactational mastitis is more common in diabetic, \nimmunosuppressed people and people predisposed by duct ectasia and periareolar infections. Clinical features of a breast abscess include: • Fever and malaise • Localized pain and tenderness • Redness and swelling of the affected breast • Positive fluctuation test. 200 \nSold by @itachibot An ultrasonogram of the affected breast is performed to confirm the abscess, and treatment \nproceeds as follows: • Analgesics, antipyretics, and breast support for pain and fever relief. • Aspiration is performed under antibiotic cover, and the pus is cultured. If aspiration proves \nunsuccessful, it should be reattempted after a few days. • Incision and drainage should be considered in cases of: • Mastitis unresponsive to antibiotics for 48 hours. • Brawny induration. • Progressive mastitis with persistent fever Note: Bacterial mastitis \nBreast abscess Condition \nLocalized inflammation due t \no ascending infection or infec \ntion due to milk stasis Occurs as a complication of \nmastitisPus formation Symptoms \nDullpain \nThrobbingpain Signs (if any) \nTendernessErythema \nPoint tendernessErythemaIn \nduration of skin(if chronic)Ly \nmphadenopathyFluctuation t \nest +vePus pointmay be prese \nnt AnalgesicsAdequate breast su \npportAspiration of Pus under \nantibiotic cover; repeated as \npirations if requiredIncision \n& drainage AnalgesicsAntibiotics (Diclox \nacillin500 mg every 6 hours \norally; Erythromycin if allergi \nc to penicillin)Adequate brea \nst support Managemen \nt 201 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The next step in management is the excision of the cyst. Treatment of breast cyst: • If the aspirate is clear (non-blood stained) or if the cyst resolves completely then no further \ntreatment is required. • If the aspirate is blood-stained or if the cyst recurs, then a core biopsy or local excision should be \nperformed. The resulting tissue should be sent for histopathology for the exclusion of \ncystadenocarcinoma, especially in elderly women.",

      "explanation": "Physiological gynecomastia is not seen in obese males. In obese men, increased fat deposition \nover the breasts is referred to as pseudo-gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is defined as  2 cm subareolar breast tissue. It can be physiological or \npathological. Physiologic gynecomastia occurs during three phases of life: • Neonatal period • Adolescence • Senescence Common to each of these phases is an excess of circulating estrogens in relation to circulating \ntestosterone. Neonatal gynecomastia is caused by the action of placental estrogens on neonatal \nbreast tissues. In adolescence, there is an excess of estradiol relative to testosterone. In \nsenescence, the circulating testosterone level falls, resulting in relative hyperestrogenism.",

It is usually subareolar and unilateral. USG guided fine-needle aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It will show thick milky \nwhite secretion confirming the diagnosis. Aspiration resolves galactocele in most cases. Surgery is \ndone for infected cysts or recurrent cases. Antibiotic therapy is not needed if the galactocele is not infected.",
