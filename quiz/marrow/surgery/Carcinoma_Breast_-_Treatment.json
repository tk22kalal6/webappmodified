      "explanation": "The image shows a sentinel lymph node biopsy using a gamma camera. The sentinel lymph node is the first draining lymph node. SLNB was first described in penile \ncancer by Cabana. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is only done on node-negative tumors. Methylene blue dye or radioisotope i.e., technetium-labeled albumin is injected into breast tissue \n(or subdermal tissue) at the site of the primary tumor or at the subareolar position. The sentinel \nnode is identified as a blue node or as a radioactive node (using a gamma camera). The frozen \nsection biopsy is sent to the pathologist for identification of cancer cells. If the biopsy is positive \nfor cancer cells, then axillary dissection is simultaneously performed. Note: The combination of blue dye and technetium-labeled colloid has been reported to improve \nthe detection of sentinel lymph nodes. Newer techniques involve the use of a fluorescent or \nmagnetic tracer instead of the radiolabelled dye. 261 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The generalized swelling of the left arm of the patient post-surgery for breast carcinoma is \nsuggestive of post-mastectomy lymphedema. Lymphoedema occurs when interstitial fluid accumulates due to defective lymphatic drainage. It \nis a common complication of breast cancer treatment, involving axillary lymph node \ndissection and radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) reduces the risk of 265 \nSold by @itachibot lymphedema significantly. Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in limb size \ndue to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb \nfatigue, and reduced limb mobility. Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm \n&gt;2 centimetres than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or \ngreater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria. Management: • Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices to reduce swelling. • Using a low-pH water-based moisturizer to prevent dry skin caused by excess fluid \naccumulation. • Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) \nby the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation. • Surgical options include lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking. Other options: Option B: Stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standing \nlymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years). They present as single/multiple \nbluish-red skin and subcutaneous nodules. They can ulcerate and hemorrhage. Option C: Axillary venous thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorous \nexercise and in weightlifters. The compression of the subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet causes \npainful swelling of the arm. Option D: Cellulitis (lymphangitis) is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is \ncharacterized by a painful area of erythematous and edematous tissue.",

The development of angiosarcoma after a combination of postmastectomy lymphedema and \nradiation therapy is known as Stewart–Treves syndrome. It can arise de-novo or in association \nwith post-mastectomy lymphedema. It presents with acute worsening of edema with \nsubcutaneous nodules which are hemorrhagic or ulcerative. Treatment is preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgical excision (radical \namputation of arm). The prognosis is poor. Option A: Tietze syndrome is an inflammatory condition characterized by chest pain and swelling \nof the cartilage around the ribs at the costochondral junction. Option C: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the muscle tissue, mostly in \nchildren and adolescents. Option D: Milroy's disease is a familial disease, caused by congenital abnormalities in \nthe lymphatic system.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The gold standard in breast reconstruction with autogenous tissue is the deep inferior epigastric \nperforator (DIEP) flap. In DIEP flap, using a microvascular technique, only subcutaneous fat and skin are taken, and no \nmuscle is removed. As the muscle is spared, there is a decreased risk of abdominal wall weakness \nand its associated complications. Lattismus dorsi flap (LD flap) - does not provide the bulk necessary and an implant is usually \nrequired. Transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM flap): • Skin, fat, and muscle are moved to the chest. • It is the most commonly used flap. • It provides good cosmesis and bulk. An implant is usually not required. • Since the rectus abdominis muscle is excised in the procedure, it can lead to abdominal wall \nweakness and hernias. The easiest type of reconstruction is using a silicone gel implant under the pectoralis major \nmuscle. Capsular contraction is a dreaded complication of silicone implants. In breast reconstruction surgeries, the timing of reconstruction may be immediate or delayed. \nImpediments to immediate reconstruction include insufficient theatre time and a lack of \nexperienced reconstructive surgeons. In addition, if the patient is likely to need post-op \nradiotherapy, then a delayed reconstruction using a flap often gives better results. 268 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The immunohistochemistry staining shown in the above image is ER+, PR+, and HER2+, which is \ntriple positive or luminal type B. Chemotherapy along with endocrine therapy, and trastuzumab is \nthe adjuvant treatment of choice. Positive immunohistochemistry staining is indicated by the presence of brown-colored tissue. • The Estrogen receptor (ER) and Progesterone receptor (PR) are both nuclear receptors, hence, \nthe nucleus is stained brown if positive. • The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a membrane receptor, hence the \ncell membrane is stained brown if positive. The image below shows positive and negative staining for ER, PR, and HER2. 270 \nSold by @itachibot The adjuvant treatment modalities currently in practice include: • Endocrine treatment such as tamoxifen or ovarian suppression. It is given for patients with \ntumors that are hormone receptor-positive (either ER+ or PR+). • Anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibody). It is given for patients \nwith tumors that are HER2 overexpressing. • Chemotherapy is given for hormone negative, HER2+, and ER+ tumors.

      "explanation": "Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor and it is the drug of choice for the prevention of recurrence \nof ER/PR positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women (usually &gt;50 years). It is given for \n10 years. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and it is the drug of choice for \npreventing recurrence in pre-menopausal women. It has an agonistic action on the endometrium, \nleading to an increased risk of endometrial cancers. Hence, it is not used in post-menopausal 271 \nSold by @itachibot women.

      "explanation": "Mastectomy followed by chemotherapy in the second and third trimester is the best step of \nmanagement in a pregnant woman diagnosed to have breast cancer in the first trimester. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is defined as breast cancer that is diagnosed during pregnancy \nor within 1 year postpartum. It is the most common non-gynecologic malignancy associated with \npregnancy. Most patients present with a painless mass in the breast with or without bloody nipple \ndischarge. Diagnosis is done by ultrasonography and tissue biopsy. Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy involves: • Mastectomy in any trimester along with chemotherapy in the second and third trimesters. • Radiotherapy and hormonal therapies are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy because \nof teratogenicity. They can be initiated after delivery. • Since radiotherapy is a component of breast conservation therapy, it is contraindicated in the \nfirst trimester of pregnancy.
