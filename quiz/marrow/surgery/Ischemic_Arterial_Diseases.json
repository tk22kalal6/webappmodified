      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most common symptom of peripheral obstructive vascular disease is intermittent \nclaudication. Intermittent claudication is the debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles due to reduced \nblood flow brought on by peripheral arterial disease. It usually signifies mild to moderate chronic \nvascular occlusive disease. Rest pain is when the disease progresses to a degree that perfusion is severely reduced and \ncramp-like pain in the calf is felt even at rest. A swollen and erythematous limb is seen in critical limb ischemia. When the limb is in the \ndependent position, there is pooling of blood which causes the limb to appear red and \nswollen(sunset foot sign). Buerger's test is done to assess the severity of peripheral vascular disease. In normal individuals, \nthe elevation of the lower limb to a 90-degree angle does not produce any pallor but in affected \nindividuals, even at an elevation of 20-degrees, pallor and venous guttering of the limb can be \nseen.",

It usually signifies mild to moderate chronic \nvascular occlusive disease. The pain classically occurs during activity and is relieved with rest. The distance that a patient can \nwalk without stopping till the pain is experienced in the muscles is known as claudication \ndistance. This distance varies only slightly from day-to-day. The muscle group affected is one \nanatomical level below the arterial disease. Boyd’s classification Class l - Pain on walking but pain decreases on continuation of walking. Class ll - Pain on walking, but continues to walk despite the pain. Class lll - Pain forces the patient to stop walking. Class lV - Pain at rest.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Chronic smoker presenting with bluish discoloration of the toe along with intermittent \nclaudication is suggestive of peripheral arterial disease and duplex scanning will be the next \nappropriate investigation. Duplex Scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-mode ultrasound to provide an \nimage of the vessel. Most scanners now have color coding, which allows detailed visualization of \nblood flow in a vessel. Different colors indicate changes in the direction and velocity of flow, with \nareas of high flow usually indicating stenotic lesions. Other options: Option A: CT Angiography (CTA) is more useful in the evaluation of visceral arterial disease (eg. \nmesenteric ischemia). It can be beneficial in peripheral artery diseases where a duplex scan shows \npoor images (aortoiliac segment involvement). CTA is not routinely recommended in peripheral \nartery disease because of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients which can lead to \ncontrast-induced nephropathy. Option B: MR Angiography is time-consuming and expensive, hence not done as the next \ninvestigation. It is contraindicated in patients with claustrophobia and metallic implants. 1173 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive and expensive \nprocedure compared to other investigations. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamic \narterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention when \nindicated. DSA is indicated only when there is a discrepancy in diagnosis or intervention is \nplanned. Complications associated with DSA include bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm \nformation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, renal dysfunction, and allergic \nreaction.",

      "explanation": "A normal artery has a triphasic signal. The waveform becomes biphasic in mild-moderate stenosis \nand monophasic in severe stenosis. Option A: Duplex scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-mode \nultrasound to provide an image of the vessel. Option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is now the standard technique whereby the \nimages obtained are digitized by computer and the extraneous background (bone, soft tissues, \netc.) is removed to provide clearer images. Option D: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and conventional catheter-based \nangiography should not be used for routine diagnostic testing but are performed before potential \nrevascularization.

      "explanation": "Angioplasty gives the best results for medium-sized vessels hence it is preferred for treating the \nvessels above the knee in peripheral arterial disease. Angioplasty is indicated in patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis. Steps of angioplasty: • Patients posted for angioplasty are given aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (loading dose of \n300–600 mg). • During the procedure, anticoagulation is achieved by administration of unfractionated heparin, \nenoxaparin, or bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor). • The femoral artery is punctured under local anesthetic, followed by insertion of a guidewire. The \nguidewire is negotiated through the stenosis or occlusion under fluoroscopic control. • A balloon catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and positioned within the lesion. The \nballoon is then inflated at high pressure for approximately 1 minute and deflated. • Once the angioplasty is done, dilatation is confirmed by performing angiogram. 1175 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the best as it lasts longer than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), \ndacron, and human umbilical vein as a graft in a femoropopliteal bypass. The GSV is the conduit of choice for arterial bypass grafts below the inguinal ligament. For bypass above the inguinal ligament, while both GSV and PTFE grafts have similar patency \nrates in the first 2 years, the GSV is superior thereafter and hence preferred over PTFE or any \nother grafts. The ipsilateral GSV is the conduit of choice for femoropopliteal bypass. When it is not available, \ncontralateral GSV should be used. Other veins are preferred when both ipsilateral and \ncontralateral GSV is not available and they include a small saphenous vein, cephalic vein, and \nbasilic vein. Non-autogenous grafts are used for patients who lack a suitable venous conduit. The most \ncommonly used prosthetic conduit is PTFE. Recent studies have shown that heparin-bonded \nPTFE is superior to compared to PTFE without heparin.",

Management of sudden arterial occlusion: • Embolectomy with Fogarty’s balloon catheter is the definitive treatment of choice. • Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be done in cases where there are no \nacute signs of limb ischemia as complete lysis of thrombus in tPA infusion is achieved within 24 \nhours, however, it is cautiously used in the elderly due to risk of bleeding diathesis. • A CT angiogram is performed after the procedure to ensure that the flow to the distal leg has \nbeen restored. Ischaemia beyond 6 hours is usually irreversible and may result in limb loss.

Atheroembolism is a condition in which multiple small deposits of fibrin, platelets, and \ncholesterol debris embolize from proximal atherosclerotic lesions or aneurysmal sites. 1177 \nSold by @itachibot The typical presentation is a patient with ST-elevation myocardial infarction presenting with \nfeatures of limb ischemia (cyanotic discoloration of the toes with pain and tenderness) following \nan intraarterial procedure (angioplasty). Digital vascular occlusion may result in ischemia and the \"blue toe\" syndrome; digital necrosis and \ngangrene may develop. Localized areas of tenderness, pallor, and livedo reticularis occur at sites \nof emboli. Since the atheroemboli tend to lodge in the small vessels of the limbs and may not \nocclude the large vessels, distal pulses are usually palpable. Large protruding aortic atheromas are a source of emboli that may lead to limb ischemia, as well \nas stroke and renal insufficiency. Skin or muscle biopsy may demonstrate cholesterol crystals.

Primary acrocyanosis is more common in females with an onset &lt;30 years. Trophic skin \nchanges and ulcerations do not occur and examination reveals normal pulses. The disorder can be distinguished from Raynaud’s phenomenon: • Because it is persistent and not episodic • There is no pain in acrocyanosis whereas in Raynaud's phenomenon there is pain and numbness • The discoloration extends proximally from the digits • Blanching does not occur",
