      "explanation": "The congenital anomaly seen in the above image is exstrophy of the bladder (ectopia vesicae). It is \nassociated with epispadias, not hypospadias. Bladder exstrophy refers to herniation of the urinary bladder through an anterior abdominal wall \ndefect. The bladder is open and exposed on the outside of the abdomen. The male to female ratio \nis 4:1. Chronic exposure of the bladder to the external environment can lead to adenocarcinoma of \nthe bladder. The clinical features of bladder exstrophy include: • Separation of the pubic bones with non-united symphysis pubis • Epispadias 925 \nSold by @itachibot • In males: Broad and short penis and bilateral inguinal hernia • In females: Bifid clitoris Management involves a staged surgical reconstruction of the bladder and genitalia. Closure of the \nabdominal and bladder wall is done in the first year of life. This often requires an iliac \nosteotomy to relax the tension on the bladder and repair the abdominal wall during \nwound-healing. Later, reconstruction of the bladder neck, sphincters, epispadias, and other genital defects is \ndone.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with continuous dribbling of urine, in spite of regular voiding, is \nsuggestive of an ectopic ureter. Ectopic ureter is a congenital anomaly that occurs as a result of abnormal caudal migration of the \nureteral bud during its insertion into the urinary bladder. They are usually associated with duplex \nureters and drain from the upper pole of the kidney. It is more common in females. The ectopic ureter usually opens into the urethra, vagina, and \nperineum. Hence, female patients present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though the \nchild voids regularly (Paradoxical incontinence). It can cause hydroureteronephrosis and \nrecurrent UTI. In males, the ectopic ureter opens always above the external urethral sphincter. Hence they are \nusually continent. However, it can cause other complications such as orchitis and epididymitis. Management involves re-implantation of the ureter into the bladder to treat incontinence and \npreserve renal functions. If the kidney is severely affected, partial nephrectomy is helpful.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute retention of urine, possibly because of benign \nprostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The next step would be to insert an 18-Fr Coudé catheter. In men, the BPH especially the middle lobe enlargement obstructs the insertion of Foley's \ncatherter. Hence, a Coude catheter is advised over suprapubic catetherization as the immediate \nnext step as larger Fr Coude catheter is helpful in negotiating past the angulation in the prostatic \nurethra. 927 \nSold by @itachibot (Note: In acute urine retention, urethral strictures should be suspected when there is resistance at \nthe urethral meatus as the strictures are more common in distal urethra than proximal urethra) Bladder outlet obstruction is usually the most common cause of acute retention of urine. Its \nclinical features include: • Inability to pass urine • Severe suprapubic pain • A distended, palpable, and tender bladder Acute urinary retention is managed by placing a urethral catheter as early as possible. Usually in \nBPH, smaller catheters will not pass through the angulation of the prostatic urethra as they are \nflexible and kink. Hence in BPH, the Coudé-tip catheter, which has a rigid and angulated tip, can \nbe used to overcome the urethral obstruction. If urethral catheter placement is not successful, suprapubic catheterization should be done. If there is a urethral stricture, a council tip catheter is used to dilate it using a cystoscope, guide \nwires, and urethral dilators.",

        "d": "Inflate with 20ml of water and under USG guidance, locate and prick the balloon"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "USG-guided rupture of the balloon percutaneously after inflating it with 20ml water should be the \nnext step of management. The failure of the balloon to deflate may be caused by: • Faulty valve mechanism • Blockage of the inflation channel by debris • Crystallization of the fluid within the balloon (when saline is used) The next best step in the management of a retained Foley's catheter is to further inflate the \nballoon with 20mL of water, following which the inflated balloon is ruptured percutaneously with 928 \nSold by @itachibot a needle under USG guidance. A suprapubic approach is used in males, while in females, either a transurethral or transvaginal \nroute can be used. A cystoscopy should be done to ensure that all fragments are removed. Other methods of approach include cutting the sidearm of the catheter, thereby disabling the \nvalve mechanism, or advancing a ureteric stylet or fine-gauge wire through the inflation port to \ndislodge debris or puncture the balloon. But these are often unsuccessful. Option A: CT is not routinely used in most settings with retained Foley's. Option B: Injection of ether through the balloon port causes the rupture of the balloon within \nseconds. But this technique causes significant bladder irritation. Option C: Balloons should not be overinflated until they rupture. This may cause severe pain and \ncould cause bladder rupture.",

Painless, gross hematuria is the most common symptom that is indicative of a bladder carcinoma \nuntil proven otherwise. Depending upon the depth of invasion, bladder carcinoma can be divided into • Flat, non-invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS) • Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (70% of cases) - does not invade detrusor muscle but can \ninvade lamina propria. • Muscle-invasive bladder cancer - invades the detrusor muscle. Diagnosis is by cystourethroscopy (directly visualizing the growth) and biopsy. Management is as \nfollows: • Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: • Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical chemotherapy with \nmitomycin C or epirubicin 931 \nSold by @itachibot • Immunotherapy with regular intravesical instillations of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) in \nhigh-risk tumors. • Muscle invasive bladder cancer: Radical cystectomy along with urinary diversion procedure and \nlymph node dissection +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy Other options: Option B: Cisplatin is an anticancer drug used to treat testicular cancer.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with normal urinalysis and cystoscopy findings are suggestive \nof interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis is a persistent, painful form of chronic cystitis, occurring most frequently in \nwomen. It is also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome or bladder pain syndrome. Its clinical \nfeatures include: • Severe suprapubic pain • Urinary frequency • Urgency • Hematuria • Dysuria without evidence of bacterial infection Cystoscopic findings seen in bladder mucosa are: • Fissures • Punctate hemorrhages (glomerulations) • Ulcerations in the fundus of the bladder (Hunner's ulcer) The image shows Hunner's ulcer seen in interstitial cystitis: 936 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment options include : • Conservative - Patient education about the chronicity of the condition, behavioral modification \n(timed voiding, bladder training), stress reduction, dietary alteration (avoidance of caffeine and \nspicy and acidic foods) and physical therapy should be the initial management for all patients. • Pharmacological - Neuropathic analgesics (e.g. amitriptyline, pregabalin) are used for those with \na significant pain component, whereas antimuscarinics and 3-agonists are used for frequency, \nnocturia and urgency symptoms. • Surgical - For those with Hunner lesions, fulguration or laser to these lesions can be beneficial. \nCystodistension as a treatment has variable evidence for success. If these options fail to improve \nsymptoms major surgical reconstruction can be considered in selected cases. Option b: Malakoplakia is a distinct form of inflammatory reaction seen in chronic cystitis. It \nappears as soft, yellow, slightly raised mucosal plaques. Option d: Cystitis cystica occurs due to chronic irritation of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy \nreveals cystic lesions in the bladder.",

Therefore it is also called prostatism sans prostate: • Increased urinary frequency • Urgency • Dribbling of urine • Hesitancy • Intermittent stream 938 \nSold by @itachibot • Nocturia It is commonly seen in young patients. Bladder outlet obstruction can occur due to 2 causes: • Muscular causes • Congenital hypertrophy of internal sphincter, i.e., Marion's disease • Dyssynergic contraction of the smooth muscle of the bladder neck (bladder neck dyssynergia) • Fibrosis of bladder neck following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)",

      "explanation": "The given intravenous urography (IVU) image depicts cobra head/adder head deformity which is a \nclassic sign of ureterocele. It is associated with dysplastic renal tissue. Ureterocele: A ureterocele is the cystic enlargement of the intramural ureter. It is thought to be caused due to \nureteric orifice atresia. It is observed more in females than males in a 4:1 preponderance and \nis bilateral in about 10% of the cases. They are similar to ectopic ureters wherein the upper pole of \nthe kidney is drained. This condition is typically associated with dysplastic and non-functional \nrenal tissue. Clinical presentation: • Children with ureterocele usually present with infection. • Adults present with renal stones. Diagnosis: • IVU shows a classical cobra head sign but is relatively infrequently performed these days. • Cystoscopy shows a bulging, translucent swelling involving the ureteric orifice where there is \nurinary stasis. It is emptied by ureteric peristalsis. Treatment: • Surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter is the treatment of choice for simple \nureterocele. • Renal stones associated with ureterocele are removed using an endoscopic incision • An advanced disease that causes hydronephrosis or pyonephrosis is an indication for \nnephrectomy.",
