      "explanation": "624 \nSold by @itachibot The clinical features and the image are suggestive of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Patients \nwho present within 48 hours of thrombosis should undergo thrombus evacuation under local \nanesthesia. This procedure involves the removal of the clot with an elliptical incision on the skin. After the initial 48-72 hours, pain typically plateaus and hence the patient is treated \nconservatively with analgesics and a sitz bath. Grade1, grade 2, and some grade 3 hemorrhoids with only an internal component can be treated \nwith simple procedures like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared and laser coagulation, \nand cryotherapy. Surgery is indicated in: • Internal grade 3 or grade 4 hemorrhoids • Hemorrhoids with a significant external component • Early grade hemorrhoids not responding to simple procedures Surgical procedures used in the removal of hemorrhoids are: • Open (Milligan–Morgan) hemorrhoidectomy • Closed (Ferguson) hemorrhoidectomy • Stapled hemorrhoidopexy - is circumferential rectal mucosectomy. It is associated with reduced \npostoperative pain, faster recovery and shorter hospital stay • Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation Open hemorrhoidectomy - Artery forceps are applied to the skin-covered external components of \nthe hemorrhoid and traction is given to reveal the internal components. Dissection of the lateral \npedicle is performed and finally, the pedicles are transfixed. Mucocutaneous bridges are left intact \nin this technique. The image below shows the procedure. Closed hemorrhoidectomy - The hemorrhoid is excised with the overlying mucosa. The \nhemorrhoid is dissected from the underlying sphincter and the mucus defect is then closed. This \ntechnique is associated with higher chances of recurrence. This procedure is however quick to \nperform and less painful. The image below describes the procedure. 625 \nSold by @itachibot",

Surgical therapy has traditionally been recommended for chronic anal fissures that have failed \nmedical therapy. The aim of this procedure is to decrease the spasms of the internal sphincter by \ndividing a portion of the muscle. Approximately 30% of the muscle sphincter fibers are divided \nlaterally using an open or closed technique. The initial treatment of anal fissures includes: • Frequent sitz baths • Analgesics 627 \nSold by @itachibot • Stool softeners • High-fiber diet If conservative management with dietary changes and laxatives fail, other options including \ntopical analgesics such as 2% lidocaine jelly, topical nifedipine, topical nitroglycerin, or a \ncombination of topical nifedipine and lidocaine can be attempted.

It will be managed using Seton's placement, which \nis done in two stages. A seton is a drain placed through a fistula to maintain drainage and/or induce fibrosis. Setons can \nbe classified as draining or cutting. Cutting seton A cutting seton has been used as a staged fistulectomy, especially in high trans-sphincteric \nfistulas. After the seton is passed during the primary surgery, it has to be tightened at regular \nintervals, till it cuts through completely. 630 \nSold by @itachibot Loose/draining seton In this method, the seton is placed to maintain drainage and create scar tissue around the \nsphincter so that its edges do not retract after cutting. Option B: Fistulotomy involves opening the fistula tract and possibly dividing the sphincter \nmuscle. It is very effective for simple fistulas with minimal sphincter involvement. Option C: Lateral internal sphincterotomy is a technique used for chronic anal fissures. Option D: In fistulectomy, the fistulous tract is cut out completely. Other surgeries for fistula in-ano include: • Endorectal advancement flap- involves closure of the internal opening of the tract, debridement \nof the tract, and mobilization of anorectal mucosa to cover the defect.

In case of an abscess- adequate rest, baths, local antiseptic dressings, and broad-spectrum \nantibiotics are advised. 633 \nSold by @itachibot Surgical approaches for the management of pilonidal sinus disease include: • Incision and drainage- for pilonidal abscess refractory to medical treatment • Bascom's procedure- is a cleft lift procedure in which hair follicles parallel to the natal cleft are \nremoved under local anesthesia • Karydakis procedure- an ovoid area of pathologic tissue is excised parallel to the natal cleft and a \nfasciocutaneous flap is mobilized to cover the defect • Limberg/ rhomboid flap- excises the pilonidal disease in a rhomboid shape and rotates a \nfasciocutaneous flap for wound closure • Others- VY advancement flaps, and Z-plasty The given image shows a Limberg/rhomboid flap done in pilonidal sinus surgery:",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history and presence of large vacuolated cells (Paget cells) on biopsy is suggestive of \nPaget's disease of the anal canal. It is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma. Paget’s disease is most commonly seen in areas with a high density of apocrine sweat glands, in \nelderly females. These can develop into an invasive cancer of the underlying apocrine glands. Clinical features include intractable itching, burning, bleeding per rectally. 10% of the patients are \nasymptomatic. On examination, eczematous, well-demarcated plaque, with occasional ulceration \nand scaling can be seen. On histology presence of Paget cells (large, vacuolated cells with mucin) confirms the diagnosis. Treatment: • Treatment of choice- complete excision • Limited, noninvasive disease-wide local excision and closure of the defect with primary sutures \nor with V-Y advancement flaps 634 \nSold by @itachibot • Invasive component- radical resection with abdominoperineal resection (APR) • Medically unfit for surgery - topical 5-FU, imiquimod, cryotherapy, or argon beam laser therapy • Recurrence- re-excision (as long as the disease remains noninvasive) Note: Most common site of extra-mammary Paget’s disease – anogenital region &gt; axilla &gt; \neyelid. Perianal Paget’s disease is usually associated with underlying visceral malignancy, most \ncommonly colorectal adenocarcinoma.",

      "explanation": "Anorectal melanoma is staged by the depth or thickness of the lesion. Anal canal melanoma is more common in females. The tumor appears as small and polypoidal or \nlarge and ulcerating. Clinical features include: • Anorectal bleeding, itching, pain, mass 636 \nSold by @itachibot • Tenesmus, and changes in bowel habits • Mesorectal lymph node metastases • Inguinal lymphadenopathy • Distant spread- to bones, lungs, and liver Diagnosis is frequently made following hemorrhoidectomy or local excision of the perianal mass. Treatment: • Tumors without anal sphincter involvement- wide local excision with negative margins • Large tumors invading sphincters- palliative APR Regardless of stage, 5-year survival rates for anorectal melanoma are very poor, averaging at \nabout 6%. The median survival time following diagnosis is 12–18 months. Note: Most common sites of melanoma are skin &gt;eye &gt; anorectal region 637 \nSold by @itachibot Hernia",
