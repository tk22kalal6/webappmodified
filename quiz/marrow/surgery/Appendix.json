It is a branch of the lower division of the ileocolic artery. The appendicular artery transverses behind the terminal ileum and enters the \nmesoappendix away from the base of the appendix. It lies along the free border of the \nmesoappendix. The terminal part or the tip of the artery lies on the wall of the appendix and may \nbecome thrombosed in appendicitis, resulting in distal gangrene or necrosis.

When the preoperative diagnosis is reasonably certain, the widely used incision for appendectomy \nis known as the gridiron incision. It is made perpendicular to a line connecting the anterior \nsuperior iliac spine to the umbilicus, with its center at McBurney's point. When better access is \nneeded, the gridiron incision can be converted to a Rutherford Morison incision by extending the \nincision obliquely upwards and laterally. Rutherford Morison's incision is suitable for a para- or retrocecal appendix that is fixed. It is an \noblique muscle-cutting incision starting from McBurney's point and extending upward and \nlaterally as needed. All layers (skin, subcutaneous tissues, external oblique, internal \noblique, transversus abdominis, and the peritoneum) are divided along the incision line. In recent years, the transverse skin crease (Lanz) incision has gained popularity due to improved \nexposure and ease of extension when necessary. This incision is placed approximately 2 cm below \nthe umbilicus along the midclavicular-midinguinal line, with its length adjusted according to the \npatient's size and obesity. If required, the incision can be extended medially by retracting or \ndividing the rectus abdominis muscle (statement 4). 555 \nSold by @itachibot When there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of intestinal obstruction, a \nlower midline abdominal incision is preferred over a right lower paramedian incision.",

A 2.5 cm tumor was encountered \nat the base of the appendix which was found to be carcinoid on histopathological \nexamination. What is the next step in management?",

        "a": "No further treatment is required",

      "explanation": "The carcinoid tumors of the appendix which are more than 2 cm in size are treated with right \nhemicolectomy. Management of carcinoid tumors: • &lt;1 cm – Appendicectomy 560 \nSold by @itachibot • 1-2 cms - Appendicectomy or right hemicolectomy depending on the individual tumor \ncharacteristics. • &gt;2 cm – Right hemicolectomy Irrespective of size, it is recommended to perform a right hemicolectomy in: • Carcinoids at the appendiceal base (&lt;2 cm from the base) • Lymphatic invasion or lymph node involvement • Spread to the mesoappendix • Tumor-positive resection margins • Cellular pleomorphism with a high mitotic index.",

      "question": "Question 22: Following an appendectomy, the specimen was sent for HPE. A well-circumscribed, yellowish \ntumor measuring 0.5 cm in diameter at the tip of the appendix was seen. The stained sections \nrevealed a typical carcinoid tumor of the appendix. The specimen had a tumor-free margin on \nall sides. The base of the appendix, the mesoappendix, and nodes were not involved. What is \nthe next step of management?",

      "explanation": "The size of the carcinoid tumour is 0.5 cm (&lt;1 cm), the margins of the resected specimen are \ntumour free, and there is no involvement of appendix base, mesoappendix, or lymph nodes. The \nbest management approach here is observation. Carcinoid tumour may be detected in ~0.5% of appendectomy specimens. Appendectomy is \nadequate in the treatment of cases with a diameter of &lt;1 cm and in those with a diameter of 1-2 \ncm without lymphovascular invasion. If a tumour is found after appendicectomy: • If it is an adenocarcinoma, perform right hemicolectomy. • If it is a carcinoid tumour, treatment differs according to the tumour size: • &lt;1 cm – Observation • 1–2 cm – Right hemicolectomy if a lymphovascular invasion is seen • &gt;2 cm – Right hemicolectomy Right hemicolectomy treatment is indicated even in tumours &lt; 2 cm in case of: • Tumours localized at the base of the appendix • Invasion of lymphatic ducts, serosa and mesoappendix • Presence of regional lymph node metastasis • Positive surgical margins • Mucin production (mucinous carcinoid tumours) • High mitotic fast cellular pleomorphism",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a patient with mucinous cystadenoma appendix and imaging \nfindings are suggestive of pseudomyxoma peritonei. Pseudomyxoma peritonei refers to a condition of mucinous ascites arising due to the rupture of a \nmucinous tumor of appendix or ovary. It most commonly occurs in patients between 40-50 years \nof age. They are often asymptomatic or present with non-specific complaints like abdominal pain \nand distension. Physical examination may reveal ascites with non shifting dullness and rarely, a palpable \nabdominal mass. CT scan may reveal accumulation of mucinous material and scalloped \nindentation of the visceral surfaces of the liver and spleen. The peritoneal surfaces may be \nthickened due to the solid components of the tumor. The histology of the primary appendiceal \ntumor is an important predictor of survival. Management consists of extensive resection of the tumor (cytoreduction) and intraperitoneal \nheated chemotherapy (IPHC). Surgical management may include omentectomy, resection of the \nperitoneum and involved organs, appendectomy or a right hemicolectomy. 562 \nSold by @itachibot Polyps and Colorectal Carcinoma",
