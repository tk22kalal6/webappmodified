      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Insulin levels in plasma are decreased in the immediate ebb phase of surgical stress or trauma. There are three phases in the physiological response to injury: • Ebb phase • Flow phase • Recovery phase. The ebb phase begins at the time of injury and is characterized by hypovolemia and decreased \nbasal metabolic rate. The predominant hormones regulating the ebb phase are catecholamines, \ncortisol, and aldosterone. The following mechanism leads to a reduction in insulin secretion during this phase: Pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor , IL-6 and IL-8 are \nproduced within the first 24 hours of injury. In the later flow phase, insulin secretion begins to normalize i.e., relatively increases. However, \ninsulin resistance by target cells occurs because of a defect in the insulin receptor/intracellular \nsignalling pathway. Thus, the perioperative period is characterized by a state of functional insulin deficiency. 136 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The presence of more than 500 white cells/mm3 in blunt trauma indicates a positive finding of \ndiagnostic peritoneal lavage. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage detects the presence of intraperitoneal blood. Its use has decreased to \nvirtually nil at many centres with the advent of the FAST examination. Indications for diagnostic peritoneal lavage are: • Abdominal pain or tenderness • Low abdominal rib fractures • Unexplained hypotension • Spinal or pelvic fractures • Paraplegia or quadriplegia • Assessment hampered by altered mental status due to neurologic injury or intoxication. Procedure: It is performed through a small infraumbilical incision with the placement of the catheter under \ndirect vision. The supraumbilical approach is indicated in pregnant patients and those with pelvic \nfractures. Aspiration of at least 10 mL of gross blood is an indication for laparotomy. If no blood is aspirated, a catheter is placed and 1 L of Ringer lactate solution is instilled into the \nperitoneal cavity and then allowed to drain by gravity. At least 200 mL of lavage fluid should be \nrecovered to allow for accurate interpretation. Disadvantages: • Neither qualitative nor quantitative • Cannot identify the source of hemorrhage • Relatively small amounts of intraperitoneal bleeding may result in a positive study • May not detect small and large injuries to the diaphragm • Cannot rule out injury to the bowel or retroperitoneal organs. 138 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "A contrast-enhanced CT scan is the best diagnostic modality (gold standard) for stable patients \nwith blunt trauma to the abdomen. It is a non-invasive and sensitive investigation. It can identify haemorrhage, intraabdominal as \nwell as retroperitoneal organ injury. However, performing CECT is time-consuming (when \ncompared to FAST) and therefore it can be used only in stable patients. FAST ultrasound is a limited examination directed to look for intraperitoneal fluid or pericardial \ninjury as a marker of the underlying injury.

FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is a rapid diagnostic examination to \nassess patients with potential thoracoabdominal injuries. FAST also stands for Focussed abdominal sonography for trauma. However, since FAST is not \nonly used to assess abdominal injuries but also to assess haemopericardium in cases of pericardial \ninjuries, the expansion Focussed assessment with sonography for trauma is preferred. It can be \nperformed within 2-4 minutes. Technique of FAST examination: With the patient in the supine position, a 3.5-5.0 MHz convex transducer is used. Four regions may be scanned: • Subxiphoid transverse view - To assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries • Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant - To assess for right liver injuries, right kidney \ninjury, and Morrison's pouch. • Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant - To assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury. • Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region - To assess the bladder and pouch of \nDouglas.

      "explanation": "FAST is not reliable in detecting less than 100 mL of free blood. Disadvantages of FAST: • Does not directly identify injury to hollow viscus • Cannot reliably exclude injury in penetrating trauma • Unreliable for the assessment of the retroperitoneum. B-lines or \"comet trails\" are echogenic bright linear reflections beneath the pleura that are usually \nlost with any air between the probe and the lung tissue. B-lines’ are expected in normal aerated lung and are visualized moving along with the sliding \npleura. Excessive ‘B-lines’, especially in the anterior lung, are abnormal and are usually indicative \nof interstitial edema. Therefore, the presence of B-lines along with seashore sign indicates the absence of \npneumothorax. The image below shows the seashore sign. Barcode sign which is also known as the stratosphere sign and lack of sliding movement in the \nlungs diagnosed by an M-mode USG is suggestive of pneumothorax. 140 \nSold by @itachibot",
