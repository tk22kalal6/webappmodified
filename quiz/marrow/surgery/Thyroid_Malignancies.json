Histopathology \nshows the presence of amyloid deposits that are derived from the altered calcitonin molecules. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a tumor of parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid gland. They are \nderived from the neural crest cells of the ultimobranchial bodies. Most of the MTCs occur sporadically. However, around a quarter of the cancers are associated \nwith familial MTC, MEN2A, and MEN2B. Patients with sporadic MTC present at an older age, whereas patients with familial MTC usually \npresent at a younger age. Features of MTC include: • Painful neck mass with cervical lymphadenopathy • Dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea if locally invaded • Diarrhoea due to increased intestinal motility by serotonin • Cushingoid habitus due to ectopic ACTH production • Metastasis is blood-borne • Microscopically, they consist of sheets of neoplastic cells separated by collagen and amyloid \nstroma It is diagnosed by careful family history, physical examination, raised calcitonin, CEA levels, and \nfine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass. Total thyroidectomy with central neck node dissection is the treatment of choice in MTC patients. \nExternal beam radiotherapy can be used in patients with unresectable tumors.

Such patients are to be \nscreened for pheochromocytoma by measuring urinary catecholamines. Pheochromocytoma, if present, should be treated first, and then MTC is to be treated next. A thyroid swelling with elevated calcitonin indicates a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC \ncan either be sporadic (80%) or familial (RET gene mutation). In case of familial medullary \nthyroid carcinoma, stimulation with pentagastrin increases the release of calcitonin. This can be \nused for the screening of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Screening of patients with familial MTC was historically done using pentagastrin stimulation test \nfor calcitonin levels to make the diagnosis. Pentagastrin is a synthetic gastrin analogue. It acts on the CCK-B/gastrin receptor of the C \ncells and increases the basal rate of calcitonin secretion. Basal calcitonin level = total C cell mass x rate of secretion. Medullary thyroid tumors secrete calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but also other \npeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, histaminadases, prostaglandins E2 and F2, and \nserotonin. Another test that can be used for screening is calcium-stimulated calcitonin levels.",

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can be inherited as familial MTC, MEN 2A or MEN 2B \nsyndromes. These conditions are autosomal dominant and occur due to RET proto-oncogene \nmutation. As almost all cases of MEN 2B develop medullary thyroid cancer, a prophylactic \nthyroidectomy may be performed even during infancy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Minor extrathyroidal extension detected only on histological examination is removed from the \ndefinition of T3 disease and therefore has no impact on either T category or overall stage. Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: • The age cutoff used for staging is increased from 45 to 55 years of age at diagnosis. • N1 disease no longer upstages a patient to stage III. If &lt; 55 years of age at diagnosis, N1 \ndisease is stage I. If  55 years of age, N1 disease is stage II. • T3a is a new category for tumors &gt; 4 cm confined to the thyroid gland • T3b is a new category for tumors of any size demonstrating gross extrathyroidal extension into \nstrap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid or omohyoid muscles) • Level VII lymph nodes, previously classified as lateral neck lymph nodes (N1b) is re-classified as \ncentral neck lymph nodes (N1a) to be more anatomically consistent and because level VII \npresented significant coding difficulties for tumor registrars, clinicians and researchers. • In differentiated thyroid cancer, the presence of distant metastases (M1) in older patients is \nclassified as IVB disease rather than IVC disease. Distant metastasis in anaplastic thyroid cancer \ncontinues to be classified as IVC disease. Minimal or occult/microcarcinoma are tumors 1 cm or less in size. They have no evidence of local \ninvasiveness through the thyroid capsule or angioinvasion. Occult malignancies are usually not \nassociated with lymph node metastases. However, about 25% of patients with these tumors have \nassociated occult lymph node metastases. These are nonpalpable and are found incidentally at \noperative and histologic examinations or at autopsy. Anaplastic : • Unlike previous editions where all anaplastic thyroid cancers were classified as T4 disease, \nanaplastic cancers now use the same T definitions as differentiated thyroid cancer. • Intrathyroidal disease (T1-3a) is stage IVA • Gross extrathyroidal extension(T3b,T4) or cervical lymph node metastases (N1) is stage IVB • Distant metastases (M1) are stage IVC 323 \nSold by @itachibot TNM staging \n7th AJCC (2010) \n8th AJCC (2018) Primary tumor(pT) TX \nCannot be assessed \n-do- T0 \nNo evidence of cancer \n-do- T1 \nTumour  2 cm, intrathyroid \nalT1a: 1 cm, intrathyroidalT \n1b:1-2 cm, intrathyroidal -do- T2 \n2-4 cm, intrathyroidal \n-do- T3 \n>4 cm limited to the thyroid \nor any size with minimal extr \nathyroidal extension (muscle, \nsoft tissue) T3a:Tumor>4 cm limited to t \nhe thyroidT3b: Gross extrath \nyroidal extensioninvading onl \nystrap muscles(sternohyoid, s \nternothyroid, thyrohyoid or o \nmohyoid muscles) from a tu \nmour of any size -do- T4 \nT4a Invades subcutaneous tis \nsue, larynx, trachea, esophag \nus, or RLNT4b Invades preve \nrtebral fascia or encases caro \ntid or mediastinal vessels Regional lymph nodes (p \nN) -do- NX \nRegional lymph nodes cannot be assessed N0 \nNo lymph node metastasis \n-do- Metastasis to level VI or VII; \nunilateral or bilateral disease N1a \nPositive in level VI; unilateral or bilateral disease -do- N1b \nMetastasis to unilateral, bilat \neral or contralateral lateral n \neck lymph nodes (levels I, II, \nIII, IV or V) or retropharynge \nal lymph nodes Distant metastasis (pM) M0 \nNo Distant metastasis \n-do- M1 \nDistant metastasis present \n-do- TNM CLASSIFICATION of T \nhyroid tumours PAPILLARY OR FOLLICULA \nR TUMORS Stage \nTNM AJCC 7thedition \nTNM AJCC 8thedition <45 y \n<55 y I \nAny T, any N, M0 \n-do- II \nAny T, any N, M1 \n-do- 324 \nSold by @itachibot TNM CLASSIFICATION of T \nhyroid tumours  45 y \n>55 y I \nT1, N0, M0 \nT1-2, N0, M0 II \nT2, N0, M0 \nT1-2,N1, M0T3,any N, \nM0 III \nT3, N0, M0T1–3, N1a, M0 \nT4a, any N, M0 IV A \nT4a, N0-1a, M0T1-4a, N1b, \nM0 T4b, any N, M0 IV B \nT4b, any N, M0 \nany T, any N, M1 IV C \nAny T, any N, M1 \n- deleted- MEDULLARY THYROID CA \nNCER Stage \nTNM AJCC 7thedition \nTNM AJCC 8thedition I \nT1, N0, M0 \n-do- II \nT2–3, N0, M0 \n-do- III \nT1–3, N1a, M0 \n-do- -do- IV A \nT4a, any N, M0;T1-3, N1b, \nM0 IV B \nT4b, any N, M0 \n-do- IV C \nAny T, any N, M1 \n-do- ANAPLASTIC C \nANCER Stage \nTNM AJCC 7thedi \ntion TNM AJCC 8thedition IV A \nT4a, Any N, M0 \nT1-3a, N0,M0 IV B \nT4b, Any N, M0 \nT1-3a,N1, M0;T3b, Any N, M \n0;T4, Any N, M0 IV C \nAny T, Any N, M1 \n-do-",

The presence of any metastatic or residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy can be detected \nby observing the uptake of radio-iodine in the entire body. To achieve effective uptake of \nradio-iodine, TSH levels need to be greatly increased, for example, by withdrawing thyroxine after \nthe surgery for 4-6 weeks. A positive whole-body iodine scan after total thyroidectomy indicates that there is either a \nmetastatic or residual disease present. These patients are treated with I131 for radio-iodine \nablation. A negative scan means there is no metastasis or residual thyroid tissue. They are followed up \nregularly with serum thyroglobulin, TSH and USG-neck. If the tumour is resistant to radioiodine ablation, EBRT (external beam radiotherapy) is done.",
