Split grafts are meshed to expand the \nsurface area that can be covered but it does not improve the cosmetic appearance.

Two \ntriangular flaps are raised. Theoretically, a 60-degree angle flap will result in a 75% increase in the \nlength of the scar and a 90-degree reorientation of central wound. Angles smaller than 60 degrees are easier to transpose but result in less lengthening and \nrealignment of the scar to less than 90 degrees. Angles larger than 60 degrees should be avoided \nbecause the force required to transpose the flaps increases markedly, making the closure of the \nwound difficult.

Random pattern flaps have a blood supply based on small, unnamed blood vessels in the \ndermal-subdermal plexus, as opposed to the discrete, well described, directional vessels of axial \npattern flaps. As random flaps have a variable blood supply, they need an adequate base (width) to \nsurvive. The rhomboid (Limberg) flap involves creating a skin flap with two opposing angles of 60° and \n120° at the corners, forming a rhomboid shape positioned directly next to the defect. The design \nallows the flap to be rotated into the defect, with the donor site closed primarily, ensuring \nminimal distortion to the surrounding tissues.

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture is suggestive of infantile hemangioma. Only monitoring of the lesion is \nrequired as in 50% of cases, complete involution is seen by 5 years of age. Hemangioma growth frequently peaks before the first year, and then the lesions enter the \ninvoluting phase. The involution phase begins in 50% of children by 5 years of age and in 70% by \n7 years of age. It continues until 10 years of age. Indications for immediate treatment are complications such as ulceration or those pertaining to \nthe location of the mass (e.g. visual issues due to large hemangioma over eyelid). Treatment options include: • Beta blockers - oral propranolol • Steroids - intralesional triamcinolone, topical clobetasol, systemic steroids • Interferon alfa-2a and vincristine - for steroid-resistant lesions • Local resection with cutting cautery or carbon dioxide laser 1128 \nSold by @itachibot Thorax & Lungs",
