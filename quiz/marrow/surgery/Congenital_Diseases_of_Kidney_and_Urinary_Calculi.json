      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The kidney has an extensive lymphatic network. It begins in three plexuses which drain into the lateral aortic nodes. These are located around the \nrenal tubules, under the renal capsule, and in the perirenal fat. The renal arteries are end arteries without collateral circulation. The right renal artery is longer \nthan the left renal artery. This is due to the position of the abdominal aorta which is slightly to the 877 \nSold by @itachibot left of the midline. The left renal vein is much longer than the right renal vein. This is due to the position of the IVC \nwhich is slightly to the right of the midline. The line of Brodel is the avascular plane of the kidney. It lies between anterior and posterior \nsegmental branches. It is an important access route for both open and endoscopic surgical \nprocedures, as it minimizes the risk of damage to major arterial branches.",

      "explanation": "The iliac fossa on the posterior abdominal wall is the usual site chosen for transplantation of the \nkidney. The left kidney is preferred for transplantation because the left renal vein is longer. In the case of a deceased donor, the arterial graft is traced until the aorta which makes it longer, \nand hence end-to-side anastomosis is possible.

      "explanation": "The given scenario with intravenous pyelogram showing flower vase sign points to a diagnosis of \nhorseshoe kidney. Division of the relatively avascular isthmus between the kidneys is usually not \nindicated. This is because it can lead to an increased risk of urinary fistula. Horseshoe kidneys are the most common fusion defects of the kidney, characterized by \nabnormalities in the position, rotation, and vascular supply of the kidney. The fused portion lies adjacent to the L3 or L4 vertebra just below the origin of the inferior \nmesenteric artery. Ascent of the fused kidneys is prevented by the inferior mesenteric artery. \nAdrenal glands remain in the normal position. There is a 2:1 male predominance. It is also commonly associated with renal cell carcinoma, \nWilms tumor, multicystic dysplastic kidney, and Turner’s syndrome. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with: • Dull renal pain • Abdominal lump • Urinary tract infections • Increased angulation of ureters resulting in - • Nephrolithiasis • Hydronephrosis Radiological diagnosis is by intravenous pyelogram which shows flower vase sign or handshake \nsign. Symptomatic management is preferred. Heminephrectomy is usually not indicated for horseshoe \nkidneys with unilateral RCC/ Wilms tumor. This is because it can result in devascularisation due \nto the unpredictable blood supply of the horseshoe kidney from nearby major vessels. 879 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Division of the relatively avascular isthmus between the kidneys is only indicated in the \ncourse of surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

In such patients, decompression or deroofing of the \ncysts (Rovsing’s procedure) cannot restore normal renal function. ADPKD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with mutations in the PKD1(chromosome 16) \nand PKD2 genes (chromosome 4). The disease does not usually manifest before 30 years of age, and in some patients, it is never \ndiagnosed. The progression of the disease is faster in males. Hypertension is the most common presentation. Renal manifestations of ADPKD include: • Flank/loin pain - either due to hemorrhage inside cysts or due to renal stones (most commonly \nuric acid stones) • Irregular upper quadrant renal mass • Hematuria • Uremia • Renal failure (seen in 10-15% of the patients who receive hemodialysis) Intravenous pyelography shows characteristic spider leg sign, as a result of stretched calyces due \nto multiple cysts. Nephrogram shows a swiss cheese appearance. On prenatal USG, the presence \nof either &gt; 3 cysts in unilateral kidneys or &gt; 2 cysts in each kidney is suggestive of PKD. 881 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment includes: • Long-term dialysis • Renal transplantation • Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) occurs secondary to a mutation of the \nPKHD1 gene.

Hydronephrosis refers to the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system caused by a partial or complete \nblockage of urinary flow. Investigations: • Ultrasound is the least invasive technique for diagnosing hydronephrosis. • Retrograde pyelography is rarely indicated but will confirm the site of obstruction before \ncorrective surgery. • Intravenous urogram (IVU) is helpful only if the obstructed kidney is functional. In IVU, the \nextrarenal pelvis is dilated and the minor calyces lose their normal cupping. In early stages, there \nis blunting of calyces followed by its clubbing in the late stages. • A renal isotope scan (DTPA or MAG-3) is the best modality to confirm the obstructive dilatation \nof the collecting system.",

Option B: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the second most common cause of hydronephrosis. In \nVUR, the valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective.

Delayed clearance \nof contrast or the radiotracer implies obstruction. Renal isotope scans have replaced intravenous pyelogram as the diagnostic modality of choice in \nUPJ obstruction. • 99mTc-MAG3 is the most commonly used isotope in dynamic renography. Its uptake reflects the \ntubular function. • 99mTc-DTPA may also be used. Its uptake reflects the glomerular function. Hence, it is \ncommonly used to assess GFR. In obstructive uropathy, 99mTc-DTPA is the preferred isotope as glomerular function declines \nearlier and more rapidly than tubular function. Micturating cystourethrogram is the investigation of choice in vesicoureteric reflux. Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is used for assessing renal scarring.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ammonium urate stones are most likely to be seen in patients with laxative abuse. Loss of potassium and sodium in laxative abuse causes intracellular acidosis, which increases the \nproduction of ammonia in urine. Dehydration and sodium loss further exacerbate hypokalemia \nand reduces the urinary volume, resulting in hyperuricemia. Highly concentrated uric acid and \nammonia promote the formation of ammonium urate stones. These are also associated with inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, ileostomy, recurrent \nurinary tract infection and recurrent uric acid stone formation. The below image shows an ammonium urate stone. 886 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Cystine stones are very hard stones, hence it is difficult to disintegrate it with extracorporeal \nshockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). ESWL is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body, which are focused \non the stones. Stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment. Stones that are difficult to disintegrate by ESWL: • Cystine • Brushite • Calcium oxalate monohydrate Stones that are relatively easy to disintegrate by ESWL: • Calcium oxalate dihydrate • Phosphate",

      "explanation": "The treatment of choice for renal calculi of size &gt;2cm is percutaneous nephrolithotomy \n(PCNL). In PCNL, endoscopic instruments are passed into the kidney using a percutaneous technique, and \nstones are removed. PCNL is also indicated in: • Staghorn calculi • Multiple stones • Proximal ureteral stones &gt;1 cm Complications of percutaneous nephrolithotomy include hemorrhage, perforation of the collecting \nsystem, and of the colon or pleural cavity. Another approach for the management of renal stones is ureteroscopic removal(URS) \nor retrograde intra-renal surgery (RIRS). In URS, stones are removed via a retrograde approach \nusing a dormia basket, or a Holmium YAG laser is used to break the stones. If PCNL or URS fails, open or laparoscopic pyelolithotomy or nephrolithotomy is done. The image below summarizes how the Dormia basket works with ureteroscopy. 888 \nSold by @itachibot",
