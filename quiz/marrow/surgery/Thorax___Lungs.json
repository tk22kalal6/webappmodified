Pulmonary sequestration is an area of embryonic lung tissue, separate from the lung. It receives \nblood supply from an anomalous systemic artery from the aorta. It is of two types: • Extralobar sequestration occurs primarily on the left side and blood supply is usually from the \nthoracic or upper abdominal aorta • Intralobar sequestration occurs in the lower lobes predominantly (&gt;95%). It is equally \ndistributed between the right and left lower lobe and blood supply is from the descending thoracic 1140 \nSold by @itachibot aorta, venous drainage via pulmonary veins Treatment involves resection of the pulmonary sequestration.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Massive hemoptysis is defined as the expectoration of over 600 mL of blood within a 24-hour \nperiod. Common causes include tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and cancer. It is a medical \nemergency. Any hemoptysis that can cause airway compromise or lead to hemodynamic collapse is called \nmassive hemoptysis. This includes blood loss of &gt;600mL/24h or &gt;150ml/h which can flood \nthe anatomical dead space of the lung. Bleeding can either be from the bronchial artery circulation (most common) or from the \npulmonary artery circulation. Bleeding from cavitary lesions is due to pulmonary artery erosion. The chest X-ray is the first investigation followed by rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. The cause of death in massive hemoptysis is usually due to asphyxiation (rather than blood loss \nitself). This is why airway stabilization by intubating into the non-bleeding lung is the priority. \nAfter ventilation is achieved, the bleeding site should be identified using bronchoscopy. Bleeding \nis controlled by laser, bronchial occlusion, or arterial embolization. Surgical resection of the \ninvolved area is also done in some cases. Indications for urgent surgical intervention for massive hemoptysis: • Presence of a fungus ball • Presence of a lung abscess • Presence of significant cavitary disease • Failure to control the bleeding.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The aneurysm of the pulmonary artery within the tuberculous cavity is called Rasmussen’s \naneurysm. Rasmussen's aneurysm is an inflammatory pseudo-aneurysmal dilatation. This occurs during the \nhealing of the tuberculous cavity. There is a progressive weakening of the arterial wall, in which \nboth the tunica adventitia and media are replaced by granulation tissue. This is gradually replaced \nby fibrin resulting in thinning of the arterial wall leading to pseudoaneurysm formation. Rupture of Rasmussen's aneurysm can cause massive hemoptysis. CT angiography plays an \nimportant role in locating the aneurysm. Most cases of massive hemoptysis arise from the bronchial arterial tree because of high pressure \nwithin bronchial arteries. Even when a pulmonary aneurysm is present, the actual bleeding may \nbe from the bronchial artery, rather than from the pulmonary artery itself. 1141 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The ultrasound diagnosis of pneumothorax depends on the presence of barcode sign, absence of \nthe sliding lung and absence of comet-tail artifacts that are seen in relation to a normal \nlung–pleural interface. Normally, lung sliding corresponds to the to-and-fro movement of the visceral pleura on the \nparietal pleura that occurs with respiration. It is a dynamic sign and can be identified on \nultrasound as horizontal movement along the pleural line. In pneumothorax, the air separates visceral and parietal pleura and prevents visualization of \nvisceral pleura. Hence lung sliding is absent and typical to and fro movement and shimmering of \nthe pleural lines will not be present. Comet tail artifacts are seen in the normal lungs due to the acoustic impedance differences \nbetween water and air, whereas it is absent in pneumothorax. The image given below shows a sliding sign seen in a normal lung. 1144 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: The quad sign is seen in pleural effusion. It consists of four lines representing the \npleura, rib, fluid, and lung. Option C: The motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates horizontal ‘waves,’ \nand the sliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the ‘sand’. The resultant picture \nis one that resembles waves crashing onto the sand and is therefore called the ‘seashore sign’ and \nis present in normal lungs.",

        "d": "Intubation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of tension pneumothorax. The first line of management in \ntension pneumothorax is to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space just anterior to \nthe midaxillary line. Pneumothorax is the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax \ndevelops when air enters the pleural space through a point that acts as a one-way valve. More and \nmore air enters with every breath without any way for the air to escape. This is a medical \nemergency where the patient can quickly deteriorate. A patient with pneumothorax presents with acute dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. A physical \nexamination will reveal: • An enlarged hemithorax • Decreased chest movements • Hyper-resonance on percussion • Absent vocal fremitus • Diminished breath sounds In addition to the above findings, a tension pneumothorax would also have the following: • Deviation of trachea to the opposite side 1145 \nSold by @itachibot • Distended neck vein • Cyanosis • Sudden onset hemodynamic compromise: • Hypotension • Tachycardia • Low O2 saturation • Loss of consciousness A diagnosis of tension pneumothorax is usually made based on the clinical findings. If the tension \nin the pleural cavity is not relieved, the patient can die due to hemodynamic collapse. Hence, \ntreatment should never be delayed waiting for radiological confirmation. The management of tension pneumothorax is to convert a tension pneumothorax into a simple \npneumothorax. This can be done by rapid decompression using a wide-bore cannula on the \naffected side, followed by the insertion of a chest tube for definitive management. The safest site for insertion of a drain is in the triangle (Triangle of safety) that lies: • Anterior to the mid-axillary line • Above the level of the nipple • Below and lateral to the pectoralis major muscle Note: If immediate management is asked, the answer will be to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5th \nintercostal space in the midaxillary line. If definitive management is asked, the answer will be to insert an intercostal tube in the triangle \nof safety. 1146 \nSold by @itachibot",
