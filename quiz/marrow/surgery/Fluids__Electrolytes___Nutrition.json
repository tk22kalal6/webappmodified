      "explanation": "The average normal urine output is approximately 1500 mL/day. A minimum urine output of 400 \nmL/day is essential to excrete the end products of protein metabolism. Fluid loss occurs mainly by four routes: • Lungs: Approximately 400 mL of water is lost in expired air every 24 hours. • Skin: In a temperate climate the loss is between 600 and 1000 mL/day. • Urine: The normal urine output is approximately 1500 mL/day. • Faeces: About 60 and 150 mL of water are lost daily in patients with normal bowel function.",

      "explanation": "12 \nSold by @itachibot Urine output is the best measure of organ perfusion and the best monitor for adequacy of fluid \nresuscitation. Adequate end-organ perfusion is best indicated by urine output of &gt;0.5 to 1 mL/kg/h. However, \nit does not give a minute-to-minute value. The level of consciousness is an important marker for cerebral perfusion. The only clinical indicators of perfusion of the gastrointestinal tract and muscular beds are \nmeasures of lactic acidosis (lactate and base deficit) and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Other options: Option A: Central venous pressure (CVP) is the mean pressure in the superior vena cava, used for \nestimation of preload and right atrial pressure. Normal CVP ranges from 2 to 7 mm Hg (3 to 9 cm \nH2O). A sick or injured patient with a CVP &lt;3 mm Hg is presumed to be volume depleted and \nmay be given fluids with relative safety. However, CVP is unreliable in assessing volume status or \nleft ventricular function with respect to resusitation. Options C and D: Blood pressure and oxygen saturation do not reflect body fluid levels.",

      "explanation": "Ileal resection may lead to steatorrhoea. The ileum is the only site of absorption of vitamin B12 and bile salts. Following resection of the \nileum, the loss of bile salts increases and is not met by an increase in synthesis. Depletion of the \nbile salt pool results in fat malabsorption that presents with steatorrhea. The efficiency of water absorption in the jejunum is 44% and in the is ileum 70%. Resection of \nileum causes reduced conservation of fluid. Loss of bile salts into the colon affects colonic mucosa, \ncausing a reduction in salt and water absorption, which increases stool losses. Small bowel motility is three times slower in the ileum than in the jejunum. In addition, the \nileocaecal valve may slow the transit. Resection of the ileum results in a significant enhancement \nof gastric motility and acceleration of intestinal transit. 14 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The best position for a conscious patient to be in during the insertion of Ryle's tube (RT) is sitting \nwith neck flexion. The described position helps in directing the RT towards the esophagus and \nalso prevents it from coiling in the oropharynx or entering the trachea. RT, also known as nasogastric (NG) tube, measures 120-125 cm. It has 4 markings at 40cm \n(cardia), 50cm (body), 60cm (pylorus), and 70 cm (duodenum) to indicate the approximate \nposition after the placement. Indications for NG tube: • Feeding in patients with dysphagia, decreased appetite, or those who are nil per os (NPO) for \nmedical or surgical reasons. • Aspiration of gastric fluid • Gastric decompression in cases of intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus. • ™ollinger-Ellison syndrome • Bowel irrigation The absolute contraindications for an NG tube are severe midface trauma, recent nasal surgery, \nand basilar skull fractures 15 \nSold by @itachibot Steps for the correct insertion of RT in an adult: • Examination of the patient’s nostril for any anatomical abnormalities and then instillation with \n10 ml of 1% lignocaine • NEX method is used to measure the length of the RT: Place the exit port of the tube at the tip of \nthe nose. Extend the tube to the earlobe, and then to the xiphisternum. • The patient is asked to sit upright with partial neck flexion. The tip of the Ryle’s tube is \nlubricated and passed along the floor of the nasal passage until a resistance is felt(corresponds to \nnasopharynx) • The patient is subsequently asked to swallow water to guide the tube through the esophagus into \nthe stomach until the marked length (based on the NEX method). • NG tube is finally taped to secure it in place. Confirmation of the correct position is done by: • Auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air • X-ray chest to locate the lead markers • Aspiration of contents and subsequently confirming gastric origin (pH &lt;6 indicates gastric \nplacement)",

      "explanation": "Hypokalemia may occur as a result of metabolic alkalosis, not metabolic acidosis. The following are various causes of hypokalemia: • Inadequate intake • Diet, potassium-free intravenous fluids, potassium deficient TPN • Excessive potassium excretion • Hyperaldosteronism • Medications • Potassium losses • Direct loss of potassium from GI fluid (diarrhea) • Renal loss of potassium (to conserve sodium in response to gastric losses) • Metabolic • Intracellular potassium shifts from metabolic alkalosis or insulin therapy Vomiting leads to hypokalemia via complex pathogenesis. The gastric fluid itself contains little \npotassium, approximately 10 mEq/L. However, vomiting produces volume depletion and \nmetabolic alkalosis. 22 \nSold by @itachibot Volume depletion leads to secondary hyperaldosteronism leads to enhanced cortical collecting \ntubule secretion of potassium in response to enhanced sodium reabsorption. Metabolic alkalosis \nfurther increases potassium secretion by the collecting tubule due to the decreased availability of \nhydrogen ions.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of refeeding syndrome which results in hypophosphatemia, \nhypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal condition that may occur due to rapid and excessive \nfeeding of patients with severe underlying malnutrition due to starvation, alcoholism, delayed \nnutritional support, anorexia nervosa, or massive weight loss in obese patients. With refeeding, a shift in metabolism from fat to carbohydrate substrate stimulates insulin \nrelease, which results in the cellular uptake of electrolytes, particularly phosphate, magnesium, \npotassium, and calcium. These electrolyte disorders can result in altered myocardial function, \narrhythmias, deteriorating respiratory function, liver dysfunction, seizures, confusion, coma, \ntetany, and death. Severe hyperglycemia may result from blunted basal insulin secretion. It can occur with either \nenteral or parenteral nutrition but is more common with the latter. 23 \nSold by @itachibot",

It is achieved by optimizing the patient's health before surgery and then delivering evidence-based \nbest care in the perioperative period.
