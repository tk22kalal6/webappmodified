      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most common site for salivary gland stone formation is the submandibular gland due to \nhighly viscous secretions. 80% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque, while parotid duct stones are usually radiolucent \nand rarely visible on plain radiography. Parotid gland sialography is usually required to identify \nthe stone. A stone located in the collecting duct or within the gland may be managed by either \nendoscopic retrieval or lithotripsy; in rare cases, surgical removal via a parotidectomy approach \nmay be required. The below USG image shows a stone in the Wharton duct of the submandibular gland.",

        "d": "Stones proximal to the lingual nerve can be removed via an intra-oral approach"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "If the stone is proximal to the lingual nerve, stone retrieval can be done via an intraoral surgical \napproach under general anesthesia. 80% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque. Conventional radiography is useful in the initial \nworkup of salivary stones, but ultrasound, CT, MRI, and sialendoscopy are required for accurate \ndiagnosis and localization (especially for smaller and parenchymal stones). The only contraindication for sialendoscopy is acute sialadenitis. This is because sialendoscopy \nand ductal dilation is more difficult in the setting of inflammation and there will be a greater \nlikelihood of ductal trauma and potential spread of infection. Management of sialolithiasis should begin with conservative measures, oral hydration, analgesia, \nmassaging of gland, sialogogues, and antibiotics (if there are signs of infection). If unsuccessful, \nthe next step is based on the sialolith's size, number, and location: • Small stones (&lt;4mm) - endoscopic removal using Dormia basket. 1039 \nSold by @itachibot • larger stones - external shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) + fragment removal or Open surgery and \nstone removal • Surgical excision of the gland should always be a last resort If distal to lingual nerve: Make a longitudinal incision over the duct. Remove the stone. Suture the \nduct using absorbable suture. If proximal to lingual nerve: intraoral approach The image below shows a stone in the submandibular salivary duct.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A slowly progressive swelling, with a variable consistency, lifting the ear lobe, is suggestive of \npleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland. Pleomorphic adenoma, the most common benign salivary gland tumor, primarily affects the \nparotid gland, particularly its superficial lobe. It is also referred to as a mixed tumor due to its \ncombination of epithelial and mesenchymal components. This tumor most commonly occurs in \nfemales around the age of 40. Clinical features: • Painless, slow-growing swelling • Lobulated, firm, variable in consistency • Lifts the earlobe • No facial nerve involvement • Curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bone. • In case of deep lobe involvement, tonsils, and faucial pillars will be pushed medially. • Features of malignancy - a sudden increase in size, ulceration of the overlying skin, facial nerve \npalsy (involvement of facial nerve), painful swelling, and restriction of jaw movements. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing pleomorphic \nadenoma. Open biopsy is contraindicated due to the chances of injury to the facial nerve. All tumors of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland should be managed by superficial \nparotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy is performed for malignant pleomorphic adenoma. Other options: Option A: Adamantinoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that usually presents with pre-tibial \npain and swelling since it most commonly affects the tibial diaphysis. Option B: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types: 1042 \nSold by @itachibot • Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development. • Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct • Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma • Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm) Option D: Sebaceous cysts are retention cysts of the sebaceous glands that present as smooth, \nnon-tender, non-transillumination swelling with a punctum (in 70% of the patients).",

Types of Parotidectomy • If only the superficial lobe is involved: • Superficial parotidectomy - only superficial lobe removed. Usually done in benign conditions. • If both lobes are involved: • Total conservative parotidectomy - both lobes are removed but the facial nerve is preserved. • Total radical parotidectomy - both lobes and facial nerve removed. Sometimes it may undergo malignant transformation. The malignant form is mixed malignant \ntumor or carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (most aggressive salivary malignancy).

It commonly \ndevelops after parotid surgery. It is caused by an aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionic \nparasympathetic nerve fibers crossed along the sympathetic pathways to the sweat glands near the \nparotid region. Clinical features are due to the result of salivary stimulation (by the smell or taste of food) leading \nto the sweating and flushing of the periauricular region on the involved side of the face.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "After parotid surgery, the nerve involved in the loss of sensation while shaving is the great \nauricular nerve. The great auricular nerve (GAN) originates from the second and third nerve roots of the cervical \nplexus (C2-C3). It supplies the skin over the lower pinna, pre-auricular region, and angle of the \nmandible (image below). The main trunk passes over the sternocleidomastoid and into the \nanterosuperior portion of the parotid glands and branches into the anterior and posterior GAN. \nThe anterior branch of GAN is often injured during parotid surgery during the initial elevation of \nthe skin flap. When GAN is injured, it can cause reduced sensations in the earlobe, pre-auricular skin, and the \nangle of the mandible that can interfere with habits such as shaving, wearing earrings, etc. 1049 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3 of trigeminal) \nsupplies the posterior part of the temple, tragus, and adjoining auricle. It does not supply the area \nwhere a person is likely to shave. However, the injury to the auriculotemporal nerve resulting in \naberrant regeneration would result in Frey's Syndrome (gustatory sweating). Option C: Though the facial nerve is the most common nerve affected during parotidectomy, any \ndamage would result in facial paralysis and not loss of sensation of the face. Option D: The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that supplies \nthe skin over the mandible, lower lip, and cheek. However, they are not injured during \nparotidectomy.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given image shows the visor approach. In the visor approach, an incision is made extending from one end of the mandible to the opposite \nside and subplatysmal flaps are elevated superiorly over the mandible (like a visor of a helmet). \nThis approach provides a wide exposure to remove larger lesions involving the anterior oral \ncavity that is not amenable to a peroral approach. This avoids a lip-splitting incision but has the \ndisadvantage of anesthesia of chin/lower lip (due to the sacrifice of submental nerves). The surgical approach selected for excision of oral cavity tumors depends on the size of the tumor, \nlocation (anterior vs posterior), proximity to bone (mandible or maxilla), and the need to perform \nneck dissection. The most commonly employed approaches are as follows: • Peroral - accessible early-stage tumors • Lower cheek flap - tumors requiring partial \nmandibulectomy or large posterolateral tumors that cannot be accessed via a peroral approach 1053 \nSold by @itachibot • Upper cheek flap - tumors requiring partial maxillectomy or those involving the hard palate, \nupper gum, upper gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior soft palate • Mandibulotomy - \nlarger tumors of the posterior oral cavity, tumors that involve the base of the tongue \nor pharyngeal wall. • Visor flap - larger lesions of the anterior oral cavity involving the anterior floor of the mouth and lower gum that are not amenable to a peroral approach Commando operation is the combined mandibular resection and neck node dissection.
