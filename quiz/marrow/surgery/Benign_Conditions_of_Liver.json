      "explanation": "The most common anomaly of the hepatic artery is replaced right hepatic artery arising from the \nsuperior mesenteric artery. Normally, the common hepatic artery gives off the right and left hepatic arteries. A middle hepatic \nartery branches off from the proximal left hepatic artery. The replaced right hepatic artery directly supplies the right lobe of the liver. Surgical significance: In individuals with replaced right hepatic artery, the diameter of the common hepatic artery is \nsmaller. In liver transplant recipients, this can be a cause for the increased incidence of \ncomplications such as thrombosis. Whereas, replaced right hepatic artery is a beneficial variant for donors undergoing donation of \nthe right lobe of the liver. The replaced right hepatic artery provides a longer and larger graft thus \nreducing chances of thrombosis. 680 \nSold by @itachibot",

It can quantify the degree of \nportal hypertension due to sinusoidal resistance to blood flow. The most accurate method of determining portal hypertension is by measuring HVPG. The most \ncommonly used procedure involves placing a balloon catheter in the hepatic vein after a jugular \nvein puncture.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario points to a case of splenic vein thrombosis which can cause left-sided \nportal hypertension. It is a pre-hepatic cause of portal hypertension. It is managed \nby splenectomy. Splenic vein thrombosis can be due to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasms (acute or chronic \npancreatitis, pseudocysts, and carcinomas) that extend outside the pancreas and invades the \nsplenic vein. This causes increased pressure in the splenic vein leading to the formation of \ncollaterals and ultimately gastric variceal hemorrhage (not esophageal varices). Normal liver function tests, normal portal venous pressures, and splenomegaly are the \ndistinguishing features from other forms of portal hypertension. The portal vein pressures remain \nnormal as there is no obstruction of the hepatic venous vasculature. Diagnosis is done by gastroscopy, liver function tests, ultrasound examination (with doppler), and \ncontrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. Treatment includes splenectomy and management of \nthe primary pancreatic pathology. 682 \nSold by @itachibot",

Most common presentation: ascites and abdominal discomfort. Risk factors include-Primary myeloproliferative disorders, anticardiolipin antibodies, \nhyperhomocysteinemia, and oral contraceptive use. Caudate lobe hypertrophy is seen in approximately 50% of the cases and it is because the caudate \nlobe drains directly into the IVC. Abdominal ultrasonography with color Doppler is the initial investigation of choice and can \ndemonstrate the absence of hepatic vein flow, spider web hepatic veins, and collateral hepatic \nveins.

Colour flow doppler is the initial investigation of choice. Treatment: • Initial treatment consists of medically managing the underlying disease process and preventing \nthe extension of the hepatic vein thrombosis through systemic anticoagulation. • The associated portal hypertension and ascites are managed in a manner similar to that in most \ncirrhotic patients. • Radiologic and surgical intervention should be reserved for patients whose condition is \nnonresponsive to medical therapy. Percutaneous angioplasty and transjugular intrahepatic \nportosystemic shunt (TIPS), in combination with thrombolytic therapy, are the preferred \nstrategies to restore the outflow of blood from the liver. • Surgical shunting, particularly with the side-to-side portacaval shunt, turns the portal vein into \na hepatic outflow tract. Factors contributing to a bad prognosis in Budd-Chiari syndrome: • 685 \nSold by @itachibot Involvement of all three hepatic veins and/or portal vein • Presence of ascites • Older age at the time of presentation • High Child-Pugh score • Chronic disease at presentation Note: JAK2 mutation points to a possibility of polycythemia vera predisposing the patient to \nhypercoagulable states and the formation of thrombus anywhere in the body.

Varices usually present with the acute \nonset large-volume haematemesis, the lower esophagus being the most common site for variceal \nbleeding. The sites for portosystemic anastomosis are: • Left gastric vein to distal oesophageal veins: oesophageal and gastric variceal bleeding • Superior rectal veins to Middle and inferior rectal veins: hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding • Left branch of the portal vein to Periumbilical veins: caput-medusae • The right branch of the portal vein to retroperitoneal veins draining into azygos, hemiazygos, \nlumbar, intercostal, and phrenic veins • Omental and colonic veins near hepatic and splenic ■exures to Retroperitoneal veins near \nhepatic and splenic ■exures Medical management of variceal bleeding includes blood transfusion (option B) and drug therapy \nwith somatostatin analogs like octreotide (option C). Short-term antibiotics like ceftriaxone are \nknown to decrease bacterial infection and increase survival. Surgical measures are preferred if medical management fails.

      "explanation": "Empiric IV antibiotic therapy is the first-line treatment for pyogenic liver abscess. Percutaneous drainage using a pigtail catheter is done routinely. It helps in the slow \ndecompression of a cyst with viscous contents. It also has a lesser chance of \ndislodgement. Drainage tube catheter is placed under US/CT guidance into the liver abscess. Surgical drainage using a laparoscopic or open approach is tried only when antibiotic therapy and \npercutaneous drainage fails. Open drainage is becoming less common at present.

The most useful laboratory evaluation is the measurement of circulating anti-amoebic antibodies, \nby enzyme immunoassay. The antibody can be present because of prior infection, and hence, \ndetection of Entamoeba histolytica lectin antigen in the serum and liver abscess pus is more useful \nfor acute infections than chronic infection. Nuclear medicine studies, such as gallium scanning or technetium (99mTc) liver scans, can be \nhelpful in differentiating pyogenic from amebic abscesses because amebic abscesses typically do \nnot contain leukocytes and therefore do not light up on these scans. The mainstay of treatment for amebic abscesses is metronidazole (750 mg orally, three times daily \nfor 10 days), which is curative. Luminal agents such as iodoquinol, paromomycin, and diloxanide \nfuroate can be administered into the cysts.",

Its life cycle consists of sheep and dogs as hosts. Humans are accidental hosts. A hydatid cyst usually develops three weeks after the infection. The cyst is surrounded by a fibrous \ncapsule called pericyst that is derived from the host tissue. The cyst wall is composed of two layers, ectocyst (outer gelatinous membrane), and endocyst \n(inner germinal membrane). Ectocyst is a laminated membrane, which is acellular. It helps in the \npassage of nutrients. The endocyst helps in producing the laminated membrane and scoleces. The brood capsules are cellular masses in the hydatid fluid which consists of scoleces. In a \ndefinitive host, these scoleces develop into adult tapeworm while in the intermediate hosts these \ndevelop into new hydatid cysts. The brood capsules are attached to the endocyst by a pedicle or \nstalk. The brood capsules may mature and detach from the mother cyst and become the daughter cysts, \nwhich are an exact replica of the mother cysts. The freed brood capsules and scoleces present in \nthe hydatid fluid are called hydatid sand.",
