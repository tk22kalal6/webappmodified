      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Mammography is best performed in the 1st half of the menstrual cycle, as breast tissue is less \ndense in the follicular phase. Also, in the 2nd half of the menstrual cycle, since ovulation occurs \nand there is a chance for pregnancy, the radiation can potentially affect the embryo. The sensitivity of mammography increases with age, as the breast tissue becomes less dense. It involves 2 standard views: • Mediolateral oblique (MLO) view- covers a greater volume of breast tissue, including the upper \nouter quadrant and the axillary tail of Spence. • Craniocaudal (CC) view- provides better visualization of the medial aspect of the breast. Mammography uses low-voltage, high-amperage X-rays. The radiation dose from mammography \nis around 0.1 cGy per study.",

Breast Tomosynthesis is typically performed in conjunction with conventional mammography. \nHence, the radiation dose is doubled. However, the accuracy is improved and false positives are \nlesser. It can be used for dense breasts and those with high-risk factors. Screen-film mammography is the conventional 2D mammography. Digital mammography/full-field digital mammography uses digital technology instead of films. \nThe diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of screen-film mammography. A minor advantage is the \ngreater accuracy in predicting lesions in dense breasts. Note: Overall, the best modality for detecting breast carcinoma is MRI.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or core biopsy of sonographically indeterminate or \nsuspicious lymph nodes can provide a more definitive diagnosis than USG alone. Ultrasonography can also be utilized to image the regional lymph nodes in patients with breast \ncancer. The sensitivity for the status of axillary nodes ranges from 35% to 82% and specificity \nranges from 73% to 97%.

      "question": "Question 20: A 22-year-old woman is found to have the BRCA1 mutation. She got herself tested after her \nmother’s death due to breast cancer with a BRCA1 mutation. At what age and with which \nmodality would you start breast cancer screening in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "a": "40 years - Mammogram",
        "b": "40 years - MRI",
        "c": "25 years - USG",
        "d": "25 years - MRI + Mammogram"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Patients with BRCA mutations or positive known first-degree family history are considered \nhigh-risk patients. These patients need to undergo annual screening MRI + Mammogram from the \nage of 25yrs. Patients with a family history of breast cancer but no known gene mutation should also start \nscreening before 40 years. Screening should begin 10 years before the earliest age of diagnosis of \nbreast cancer in the first-degree relative. E.g- If the mother was detected with breast cancer at 40 \nyears of age, the daughter should start screening by the age of 30 years. High-risk patients for breast cancer: • Women with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation • Two first-degree relatives with breast cancers with or without gene mutations • Women with a history of chest irradiation between the ages of 10 and 30 • 2 or more cases of breast cancer &lt; 50 years old in the family • Mutation (or a first-degree relative with a mutation) in the TP53 or PTEN genes 237 \nSold by @itachibot",
