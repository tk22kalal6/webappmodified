      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Aphthous ulcers, surrounded by a rim of erythematous mucosa, are the earliest lesions seen in a \npatient with Crohn's disease during endoscopy. Crohn's colitis usually spares the rectum and is most severe in the ileocaecal region. • In early Crohn's disease, small, punched-out aphthous ulcers are often seen (the result of \nsubmucosal lymphoid follicle expansion). • In moderate disease, the aphthous ulcers coalesce into larger ulcers, which may take on the \nappearance of a star (stellate ulcers). • As disease severity increases, submucosal edema and injury can result in cobblestoning of the \nmucosa (option A) and eventually the formation of serpiginous ulcers, which are typical findings \nin Crohn's disease. Thorn-like extraluminal projections in barium studies are known as rose-thorn appearance, and \nare a typical sign of Crohn's disease. They represent deep penetrating linear ulcers or fissurings \ntypically seen within stenosed terminal ileum with a thickened wall. (Options C and D)",

The course of the disease after surgery is unpredictable since surgery does not cure Crohn's \ndisease. Instead, the probability of relapse increases with the time since resection. Other options: Option A: Antibiotics alone cannot treat a Crohn's mass effectively. Abscesses can be treated with \nmetronidazole and ciprofloxacin and should also undergo drainage (and resection if needed). Option C: The terminal ileum is most commonly involved in Crohn's disease. Option D: On endoscopic examination, discontinuous \"skip\" lesions are visualized.

Abdominal \nradiography shows transverse or right colonic dilation of &gt;6 cm and loss of haustrations. It is \nusually associated with ulcerative colitis as indicated by history of chronic bloody diarrhoea. It can be triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics which interfere with gut motility. \nFeatures of secondary bacterial infecton and sepsis may be present. It can be complicated by \nintestinal perforation. It usually resolves with supportive treatment (correcting electrolyte imbalance, fluids, and bowel \nrest) and medical therapy which includes glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory drugs, and \nantibiotics. However, an urgent colectomy is indicated in patients who do not show signs of \nimprovement. Indications for urgent surgery include: • Frank intraperitoneal peritonitis, secondary to perforation • Life-threatening hemorrhage or increasing transfusion requirements • Worsening systemic toxicity • Worsening colonic dilatation Other options: Option B: Volvulus occurs when the air-filled segment of the colon twists around the mesentery. \nThe sigmoid colon is the most commonly involved part of the large intestine (90%). The patient \ncan present with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. X-ray abdomen shows a bent inner \ntube or coffee bean appearance. 521 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Ogilvie syndrome, also known as colonic pseudo-obstruction is a functional disorder \nwith colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. It occurs commonly in hospitalized \npatients and is associated with narcotics, bed rest and comorbid disease. X-ray shows dilatation of \nthe colon (predominantly transverse colon) with absent mechanical obstruction. Option D: Pneumatosis intestinalis is the presence of gas within the bowel wall seen in any part of \nthe GI tract but most commonly in the jejunum. It is a pathognomic feature of necrotizing \nenterocolitis. X-ray of the abdomen will show intramural gas in the bowel.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and X-ray film showing saw-toothed appearance of the colon are \nsuggestive of colonic diverticulosis. They are false diverticula. Diverticulosis refers to the herniation of the mucosa and muscularis mucosa through the colonic \nwall, usually at the point where the nutrient artery enters the colon (mesenteric side). The \ncondition is usually asymptomatic until complications arise. They may be detected incidentally. \nOn a barium X-ray, the colon with diverticular disease will have a saw-toothed appearance. Colonic diverticula are more often acquired than congenital. They are common in developed \ncountries that have a low fiber diet. A low fiber diet results in low stool volume. As the colon \ngenerates higher intraluminal pressure to propel smaller volumes of stools, low stool volumes \ncause an increase in colonic wall tension and segmentation of the colon. Prolonged colonic contractions and high pressures (directed radially along the colonic wall) \nresults in the formation of pulsion diverticula. The sigmoid colon is the most common site. Note: True diverticulum involves the herniation of all the layers of the intestine whereas false \ndiverticulum involves the herniation of only the mucosa and submucosa.",

      "explanation": "In the general population, left-sided diverticulitis is more common. The sigmoid colon (left colon) \ninvolvement is more common than the right colon involvement. 523 \nSold by @itachibot Diverticulitis is the inflammation and infection of the diverticulum. It most commonly presents \nwith • left lower abdominal pain (often termed as left-sided appendicitis) • fever • a change in bowel habits • anorexia, nausea • urinary urgency if there is an associated inflammation of the bladder etc. Right-sided diverticulitis occurs more often in younger patients of Asian descent than in other \npopulations and presents with pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting with these \nsymptoms are often thought to have acute appendicitis, and often the diagnosis of right-sided \ndiverticulitis is subsequently made in the operating room. The Hinchey classification is used to describe the severity of the diverticular disease, complicated \nby perforation.

Contrast enema studies are the most accurate way to find out the colonic diverticula. However, \nbecause of the risks of extravasation of barium from the perforation and aggravation of \ninflammation, it is avoided. In contrast to barium enema, a CT scan demonstrates both the intraluminal and extracolonic \nmanifestations of acute right-sided diverticulitis. CT findings include pericolic soft tissue stranding, colonic wall thickening and pericolic fat \ninfiltration (streaky fat). 524 \nSold by @itachibot Barium enema in diverticulosis shows a saw-tooth appearance.",

Sigmoid volvulus is a cause of large bowel obstruction and occurs when the sigmoid colon twists \non the sigmoid mesocolon. Symptoms include constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, and/or \nvomiting. Onset may be acute or chronic. It occurs more commonly in patients with a history of \nmental illness and chronic constipation. X- ray abdomen shows a large, dilated loop of the colon, often with a few air-fluid levels.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette and the X-ray findings are suggestive of caecal volvulus. It is \ndifferentiated from sigmoid volvulus as there is only a single air-fluid level and the apex of the \nvolvulus pointing towards the left upper quadrant. It is commonly seen in females in the 4th and 5th decade who can present with partial or \ncomplete intestinal obstruction. The clinical features include: • Marked abdominal distention 530 \nSold by @itachibot • Abdominal pain • Obstipation • Nausea and vomiting etc. On examination, a palpable tympanic swelling in the midline or the left side may be seen. If there \nis strangulation or perforation of the obstructed bowel segment, peritoneal signs (rigidity, \nrebound tenderness etc.) can be present. Radiological findings include caecal dilatation, single air-fluid level, and absence of gas in the \ndistal colon. On X-ray abdomen, the apex of the cecal volvulus points towards the left upper \nquadrant ( vs apex pointing towards the right upper quadrant in sigmoid volvulus) CECT abdomen is the investigation of choice that shows a whirl sign (also seen in the midgut \nvolvulus). Management of cecal volvulus includes supportive therapy with nasogastric tube, iv fluids, \nantibiotics etc. and early surgical intervention. • Perforated or strangulated cecal volvulus should be treated with right hemicolectomy • If there is no sign of perforation or strangulation, either cecopexy or right hemicolectomy can be \nperformed. Option B: Sigmoid volvulus (image shown below) is a cause of large bowel obstruction and occurs \nwhen the sigmoid colon twists on the sigmoid mesocolon. X-ray abdomen shows a large, dilated \nloop of the colon, often with a few air-fluid levels. Specific signs include the coffee bean sign \nand the absence of rectal gas. On X-ray abdomen, the apex of the sigmoid volvulus points towards \nthe right upper quadrant. Option C: Toxic megacolon (image shown below) is defined as the dilatation of the transverse \ncolon to a diameter of more than 6 cm. It is usually associated with severe ulcerative colitis. It can \nbe triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics as they interfere with gut motility. 531 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Fecal retention is an accumulation of a large amount of stool within any bowel segment, \nmost commonly within the colon usually due to chronic constipation. A colonic distention with \nfecal material is often called fecal loading on the radiograph. It can be complicated by fecal \nimpaction and subsequent bowel obstruction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of ischemic colitis and it occurs most commonly at the splenic \nflexure. Ischemic colitis occurs due to interruption or decrease in colonic blood flow. It may occur with \nmany different conditions, including embolism from cardiac disease, low-flow states such as \ncongestive heart failure, sepsis, and vasopressor use. Major vascular surgery (both open and \nendovascular repair), especially involving the abdominal aorta, is a well-known risk factor for \ndeveloping ischemic colitis. Although any area of the colon may be affected, the watershed areas of the splenic flexure \n(Griffith’s point) and the rectosigmoid (Sudeck’s point) are the most prone to ischemia because of \nthe often incomplete anastomoses of the marginal artery in these locations. The next most \ncommon area afflicted is the cecum, secondary to low blood flow in the terminal branches of the \nileocolic artery. Splenic flexure (also known as Griffith's point) is a watershed area between the superior and \ninferior mesenteric arteries. Sudeck point is a watershed area between the sigmoid arterial branch from the inferior mesenteric \nartery and the superior rectal artery (branch of Inferior mesentric artery). 532 \nSold by @itachibot The marginal artery of Drummond runs parallel to the colon, connecting the SMA and IMA \ncirculation - the majority of blood flow to the left and sigmoid colon in case of occlusion of the \nIMA. Arc of Riolan is a variable collateral vessel that connects the SMA (middle colic vessel) to the IMA \n(left colic).",
