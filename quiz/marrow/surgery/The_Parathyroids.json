      "explanation": "A thyroid-specific tracer like 99Tc-Pertechnetate and subsequent subtraction images could be \nused to rule out the false positives caused by the solid thyroid nodules such as Hurthle cell nodule. The Sestamibi scanning is a nuclear-based imaging test used to localize the parathyroid glands. \nSestamibi is a monovalent lipophilic cation that accumulates in mitochondria. Due to this, there is \na difference in the rate at which it gets washed out depending upon the number of mitochondria \nin each tissue. Parathyroid adenomas often have a high concentration of oxyphilic cells with high \nmitochondrial content and they retain tracers and have a slower washout compared to the normal \nglands. In patients with nodular goiter or functional tumors of the thyroid gland, increased uptake of \nsestamibi by the thyroid gland makes parathyroid visualization difficult. There are two primary \ntechniques to differentiate sestamibi uptake by abnormal parathyroid and thyroid tissue: • Dual-isotope subtraction imaging (with sestamibi and either iodine-123 or 99mTc \npertechnetate) - 99mTc pertechnetate is taken up only by the thyroid. The 99mTc pertechnetate \nscintigram is then digitally subtracted from the sestamibi scan to allow parathyroid localization. • Single-isotope dual-phase imaging (with sestamibi alone with early and delayed imaging) - since \nthe rate of washout from the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland is slower when compared to the \nthyroid gland. The image given below shows the dual-isotope subtraction imaging. 339 \nSold by @itachibot",

Angiography of renal arteries is not a useful investigation for \nhyperparathyroidism. Nephrocalcinosis occurs in this condition due to hypercalcemia. It decreases renal concentrating \nability, which may cause polyuria and polydipsia. Clinical features of hyperparathyroidism: • Bones: • Pathological fractures • Subperiosteal bone resorption - 2nd and 3rd digits, most common in radial aspect • Salt and pepper skull • Osteitis fibrosa cystica or VonReckling Hausen’s disease of bone • Stones • Multiple and recurrent renal stones - most common • Nephrocalcinosis • Abdominal groans - colicky due to pancreatitis • Psychiatric overtones - raised PTH causing CNS depression and psychiatric symptoms • Band keratopathy • Features of hypercalcemia - • Vomiting • Confusion 340 \nSold by @itachibot • ECG changes: increased PR interval, shortened QT interval The image given below shows salt and pepper skull seen in hyperparathyroidism. Investigations done in primary hyperparathyroidism: • Ultrasonography of the neck is a safe and widely used technique for the localization of abnormal \nparathyroid glands. • Nuclear medicine scanning with radiolabeled Sestamibi is also a widely used technique. \nSestamibi accumulates in parathyroid adenomas. This radionuclide is concentrated in the thyroid \nand parathyroid tissue but usually washes out of normal thyroid tissue in under an hour. It \npersists in abnormal parathyroid tissue. • Dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry is a useful tool to demonstrate skeletal involvement in \nprimary hyperparathyroidism.

      "explanation": "Reduced serum phosphate is not an indication for surgical intervention in tertiary \nhyperparathyroidism. Renal transplantation in patients with chronic kidney diseases may be associated with \nautonomous functioning of the parathyroid gland. This is called tertiary hyperparathyroidism \nwhere there is hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism. The indications for surgical intervention in tertiary hyperparathyroidism are as follows : • Subacute severe hypercalcaemia (&gt;3 mmol/L) • Impaired graft function • Nodular hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland(s) • Progressive symptoms for &gt;2 years following transplantation • Worsening bone disease - pain, fractures, bone loss • Renal stones/nephrocalcinosis • Soft tissue or vascular calcifications",

      "explanation": "The patient’s long-standing renal failure and elevated calcium, phosphate, and PTH are suggestive \nof tertiary hyperparathyroidism. This form of hyperparathyroidism can be life-threatening, and all \npatients with it should be referred for surgical intervention. The surgical procedure of choice for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is subtotal parathyroidectomy. \nIn subtotal parathyroidectomy, the affected glands are completely removed and the least affected 347 \nSold by @itachibot gland is partially resected. Option A: Total parathyroidectomy without an autograft is not a treatment option due to the \npostoperative and persistent difficulties in managing the associated hypocalcemia. Option C: Minimally invasive approaches commonly refer to the removal of a localized abnormal \nparathyroid gland through an incision less than 3cm in length. It is based on the principle that \nover 80% of individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single adenoma. It is \ncontraindicated in multi-glandular disease, lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism, and \nhyperparathyroidism associated with familial syndromes. Option D: Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic used in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. \nThe use of calcimimetics in tertiary hyperparathyroidism remains controversial and has not been \napproved for this indication.",
