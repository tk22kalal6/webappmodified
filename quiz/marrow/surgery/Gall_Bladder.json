      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The gallbladder does not have muscularis mucosa and submucosa. Those layers are absent in the \ngallbladder. The mucosa of the cystic duct is arranged in spiral folds known as the valves of the Heister. The \nvalves act to keep gallstones from entering the common bile duct in spite of distention and \nintraluminal pressure. Hartmann’s pouch is a diverticulum that can occur at the neck of the gallbladder. It may obscure \nthe cystic duct and Calot’s triangle during laparascopic surgical dissection. The Phrygian cap is present in 2–6 percent of cholecystograms and may be mistaken for a \npathological deformity of the organ. It is not an indication for cholecystectomy.",

Calot's triangle is an important surgical landmark as the cystic artery usually can be found within \nits boundaries. The cystic artery should be identified while performing a cholecystectomy to avoid \ndamage to the extrahepatic biliary system. Occasionally, there can be a tortuous course of the right hepatic artery in some patients. This is \ncalled Moynihan's hump or caterpillar hump. It is an important anomaly that should be \nrecognized in order to prevent intraoperative vascular and biliary injuries. Note: The cystic artery is one of the contents as well as forms the superior boundary of the Calot's \ntriangle (originally described in 1891 by Jean-François Calot)",

Hereditary spherocytosis leads to the production of black \npigment stones.

Approximately 90% of renal stones, 10% of gall stones, and 5% of appendicoliths contain enough \ncalcium to appear radiopaque on plain films. Gallbladder diseases are regularly diagnosed by ultrasound because of the superficial location of \nthe gallbladder and the absence of overlying bowel gas. Ultrasound has a high specificity and \nsensitivity for cholelithiasis. It is considered as the first test of choice for delineation of any biliary \npathology. Stones appear acoustically dense and also produce an acoustic shadow. They also move \nwith a change in posture. However, CT provides superior anatomic information and therefore is \nindicated when more anatomic delineation is required. 747 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Non-visualization of the gallbladder in HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is suggestive \nof acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is the inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usually \nbecause a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct. In the majority of cases, the process is limited by the \nstone slipping back into the body of the gallbladder. Clinical features include: • Pain in the right hypochondrium with referred pain to the back • Fever • Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia • Jaundice • Positive Murphy's sign • Positive Boas' sign Murphy's sign: After asking the patient to exhale, the examiner places his hand below the costal \nmargin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line of the patient. The patient is then instructed to \ntake a deep inspiration. If the patient stops breathing and winces with a ‘catch’ of breath, \nMurphy’s sign is said to be positive. Boas' sign: It is the presence of an area of hyperaesthesia at the site of radiation of the pain to the \nback, typically, below the scapula. USG and CT scans are helpful in establishing a diagnosis. The gold standard investigation of acute \ncholecystitis is the HIDA scan. The radioisotope used is Technetium-99m ( 99mTc)-labeled \nderivative of iminodiacetic acid. The following image depicts the radioisotope scan in which the gallbladder is not visualized even \nafter 4 hours. 748 \nSold by @itachibot Unlike bilirubin, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) compounds do not undergo conjugation in the \nhepatocytes. They are rapidly excreted into the bile. This enables excellent visualization of the bile \nducts and gallbladder within 30–60 minutes of injection. Since cystic duct obstruction initiates acute cholecystitis, there is non-visualization of the \ngallbladder 3 - 4 hours after the intravenous injection of 99m Tc-IDA. This is characteristic of \nacute cholecystitis. Thus visualization of the GB establishes cystic duct patency and rules out acute \ncholecystitis.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with an X-ray showing gas in the biliary tract (pneumobilia) and \nmultiple air-fluid levels indicating small bowel obstruction is suggestive of gallstone ileus. The \ndistal ileum is the most common site to be obstructed in gallstone ileus because it tapers before \nentering the cecum. Gallstone ileus is caused by the obstruction of the intestinal lumen by a gallstone, leading to a \nmechanical blockage. Big gallstones will not be able to pass through the normal cystic duct. This \ncauses inflammation of the gallbladder and results in pressure necrosis. This in turn leads to \nbiliary-enteric fistula formation. 757 \nSold by @itachibot Plain radiographs demonstrate air-fluid levels consistent with a small bowel obstruction. Rigler's \ntriad is seen in gallstone ileus. It includes: • Intestinal obstruction • Gas in the biliary tract (pneumobilia) • Ectopic gallstone (Radio-opaque shadow in the right iliac fossa) The investigation of choice is the CT scan. Pneumobilia is a ubiquitous finding because the fistula \nthat permitted a stone to pass into the duodenum allows air into the gallbladder and the biliary \ntree. Initial management involves keeping the patient nil per-oral, IV fluids, IV antibiotics, and \nanalgesics. If there is no strangulation or peritonitis, it can be managed by: • Milking the stone beyond ileocaecal junction • Crushing the stone • Enterotomy to remove the stone If there is perforation or strangulation, resection and anastomosis are done. Cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid future complications. Fistula closure can be \nperformed along with cholecystectomy or it can be performed later (two-stage procedure). Given below is a plain X-ray of the erect abdomen showing air in the biliary tract (pneumobilia). A large gallstone causing gallstone ileus is shown below. 758 \nSold by @itachibot",

ERCP \nis the next line of management for this patient. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of stone in the common bile duct (CBD) or biliary tree. It can \nbe primary or secondary: • Primary stones are formed in the CBD or biliary tree itself and are rare. • Secondary stones are passed from the gallbladder to the CBD. They are easier to manage than \nprimary stones. It can be an asymptomatic and incidental finding or present with features such as jaundice (most \ncommon), abdominal pain, and fatigue. When there is inflammation of the biliary tree 760 \nSold by @itachibot (cholangitis), the patient will have intermittent pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad). Investigations: • Liver function tests will show elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. • Abdominal ultrasound is the first imaging modality done and may show gallstones and dilated \nbile duct (&gt;8 mm). • CT is sensitive for CBD stones. It shows stones, location, ductal stricture or block, ductal \ndilatation, and intrahepatic biliary changes. • MRCP is highly sensitive and specific for CBD stones, but it is only diagnostic and intervention \ncannot be performed. Management: • ERCP with sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice, followed by the removal of stones using a \ndormia basket or placement of a stent. • Despite ERCP being an invasive procedure, it has the advantage of being both a diagnostic and \ntherapeutic procedure and is more suited for elderly patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia and \nsurgery. Other options: Option A: Cholecystectomy is not recommended for elderly patients, owing to the risk of old age \nand associated anesthetic and surgical complications.
