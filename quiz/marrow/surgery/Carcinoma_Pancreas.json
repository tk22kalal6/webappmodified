      "explanation": "Mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a premalignant condition. Mucinous cystadenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) is a benign tumor of the pancreas \nwith high risk of malignancy. They are commonly seen in perimenopausal women, and about 855 \nSold by @itachibot two-thirds are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. MCNs are mostly incidental findings. When symptoms are present, they are usually nonspecific \nand include upper abdominal discomfort, early satiety, or weight loss. The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium. MCN's contain mucin-producing epithelium and \nare identified histologically by the presence of mucin-rich cells and ovarian-like stroma. Staining \nfor estrogen and progesterone is positive in most cases. Malignant transformation of MCN is common with large tumors and old patients. This is due to a \nstepwise accumulation of mutations (K-ras, p53).

It is most commonly seen in the head of the pancreas. The intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm can be diagnosed with the following findings \n(Ohashi triad) during endoscopy: • Bulging ampulla of Vater (fish-mouth sign) • Dilated pancreatic duct • Mucin secretion from the opening Equal distribution is seen between males and females in IPMN. Patients are usually in their \nseventh or eighth decade of life and present with abdominal pain or recurrent pancreatitis. This is \ncaused by the obstruction of the pancreatic duct by thick mucin. Some patients have symptoms \nsecondary to pancreatic insufficiencies like steatorrhea, diabetes, and weight loss. IMPNs are of three types: • Branch-duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) - affects only the small side branches. It is less frequently \nassociated with malignancy. • Main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN) - Affects the main pancreatic duct. Malignant transformation is \ncommonly seen. • Mixed-type IPMN - side-branch IPMNs that extend into the main duct",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Delayed gastric emptying is the most common complication following the Whipple procedure, not \nbiliary leakage. Delayed gastric emptying is characterized by the need for prolonged nasogastric decompression or \nthe inability to tolerate oral intake. Most pancreatic fistulas are controlled by drainage catheters placed at the time of surgery. A \npancreatic leak or pancreatic fistula is defined as the output via an intraoperatively placed drain \n(or percutaneous drain) of any measurable volume on or after postoperative day 3, with amylase \n&gt;3 times the normal value. Other complications of the Whipple procedure include: 866 \nSold by @itachibot • Wound infection • Intra-abdominal abscess • Cardiac events • Bile leak • Overall reoperation • Exocrine insufficiency • Endocrine insufficiency",

Chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer is indicated in patients with unresectable tumours and lymph \nnode metastasis. Agents used in chemotherapy are: • Gemcitabine • Gemcitabine with capecitabine • Albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) • FOLFIRINOX - a combination of fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin However, there is only a 2–5 months increase in median survival with these regimens. No \nlong-term cure is seen with chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic carcinomas. 867 \nSold by @itachibot Congenital Diseases of Kidney and Urinary Calculi",
