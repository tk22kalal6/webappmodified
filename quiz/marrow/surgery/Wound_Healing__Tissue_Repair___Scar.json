      "explanation": "The given image shows granulation tissue formed during the proliferative stage of wound healing. \nFibroblasts are the predominant cell during the proliferative stage. Fibroblasts are specialized cells that differentiate from resting mesenchymal cells into connective \ntissue. The primary function of fibroblasts is to synthesize collagen. The proliferative stage of wound healing is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue, \nwhich consists of a capillary bed, fibroblasts, macrophages, and a loose arrangement of collagen, \nfibronectin, and hyaluronic acid.",

      "explanation": "Dietary deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy) results in poorly formed collagen and affects the early \nmatrix scaffolding. Type I and Type III collagens are both present in the extracellular matrix of normal skin (in an 8:1 \nratio). However, during the proliferative phase of wound healing, the dominant collagen that is \nlaid is Type III. This stage is also known as early matrix scaffolding. Type III collagen is gradually \nreplaced by type I collagen (during the final remodeling phase) until a ratio (type I: type III) of 4:1 \nis achieved. 1095 \nSold by @itachibot",

To reduce the chances of infection ,the surgeon should make every effort to remove all devitalized \ntissue and leave a clean wound for closure.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "While all of the given options are inhibited by steroids, the major effect of steroids is to inhibit the \ninitial inflammatory phase of wound healing (angiogenesis, neutrophil and macrophage \nmigration, and fibroblast proliferation) and the release of lysosomal enzymes. The stronger the anti-inflammatory effect of the steroid compound used, the greater the inhibitory \neffect on wound healing. Steroids used after the first 3 to 4 days post-injury do not affect wound \nhealing as severely as when they are used in the immediate postoperative period. In addition to inhibiting collagen synthesis, steroids also inhibit epithelialization and contraction \nand contribute to increased rates of wound infection, regardless of the time of administration. Steroid delayed healing of cutaneous wounds can be stimulated to epithelialize by topical \napplication of vitamin A.",

      "explanation": "Everted edge around a chronic wound is a sign of malignant transformation. The majority of wounds that have not healed in 3 months are considered chronic and are prone to \nmalignant changes. Malignant wounds are differentiated clinically from non-malignant wounds by \nthe presence of overturned edges. Biopsy of the wound edges should be performed to rule out \nmalignancy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Contaminated wounds older than 6 hours should be managed with delayed primary closure. The wound is cleaned, debrided, and left open for a few days. This allows soft tissues to drain and \nalso ensures no infection is present before surgical closure can be done. Wound closure is categorized into primary, secondary, or tertiary: Primary closure is done for clean wounds with minimal tissue loss that are amenable to \napproximation of wound edges. Healing occurs by primary intention. Primary closure is ideally \nperformed within 6 to 8 hrs of trauma, but wounds in vascular areas (e.g. face) may be delayed to \nup to 24 hours after trauma. Secondary closure allows healing by secondary intention. The wound is left open to heal largely by \nthe formation of granulation tissue and contraction. These wounds often have significant tissue \nloss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, with devitalized edges. Wound dressings are \nchanged daily to aid in the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent contraction. Tertiary closure, also known as delayed primary closure, results in a combination of healing by \nprimary and secondary intention. The wound is thoroughly irrigated, debrided, and left open for 2 \nto 5 days before surgical closure. It is used for wounds that are grossly contaminated without \nsignificant tissue loss.",

Pressure sores are skin or soft tissue injuries that occur due to prolonged pressure over specific \nareas of the body. An external pressure of &gt;30 mmHg leads to the formation of pressure sores. 1097 \nSold by @itachibot The common sites of pressure sores in decreasing frequency are the ischium, greater trochanter, \nsacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral followed by medial), and occiput. Pressure sores can be prevented with good skincare, the use of air-fluidized beds, special \npressure-dispersion cushions, or foams. Repositioning the patient every two hours can lessen the \npressure on the area. Ulcers of stages 1 and 2 often do not require operative measures. They are managed with regular \nwound cleaning and dressing with a good antibiotic cover. Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are adequately debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is used to \npromote the growth of granulation tissue required for surgical closure. Large skin flaps that have \nmuscle with sensory innervation are best for reconstruction.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "During the first week, a surgical wound has minimal inherent strength because the dermal edges \nare held together solely by a hemostatic plug and sutures. During the second postoperative week, fibroblasts proliferate rapidly and begin to produce type I \ncollagen in addition to type III. The strength of the wound is still limited to less than 10% of its \nfinal strength. By week 6, the concentration of strong collagen fibers begins to resemble that of \nintact skin. As the collagen matures and becomes denser, the scar becomes almost acellular as the fibroblasts \nand blood vessels reduce.The disorganized collagen fibers become aligned along stress lines with \ntheir strength being in their weave rather than in their amount. Most of these changes occur over the first three months but a scar will continue to mature for 1 to \n2 years. Tensile strength will continue to increase but would not be expected to exceed 60–80% of \nthat of normal skin.",

A keloid scar is defined as excessive scar tissue that extends beyond the boundaries of the original \nincision or wound (option A) and rarely regresses on its own.

Neuropathic ulcers occur as a result of repeated trauma to the insensitive part due to peripheral \nneuropathy. There is a lack of sensation over the pressure points, leading to unnoticed \nmicrotrauma, wounds or cuts which develop into an ulcer. Causes of neuropathic ulcers include \ndiabetic neuropathy, B12 deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, leprosy, peripheral nerve injury, \ntransverse myelitis and myelomeningocele.
