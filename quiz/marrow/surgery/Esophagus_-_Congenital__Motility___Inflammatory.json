A tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal communication between the esophagus and trachea. \nType C lesion is associated with proximal esophageal atresia and distal TEF. The proximal blind \npouch ends approximately at the distance of one or two vertebral bodies from the distal TEF. Tracheoesophageal fistula is associated with VACTERL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal, \nesophageal, renal, and limb) anomalies. Drooling of saliva, inability to pass a nasogastric tube and history of polyhydramnios suggest a \ndiagnosis of oesophagal atresia with or without TEF. This can be confirmed with a chest X-ray \nimage showing a coiled nasogastric tube in the oesophagal pouch as shown in the image below.",

This degeneration results in the failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter \n(LES) on swallowing. The patients present with a classic triad of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. The \ndysphagia initially begins with liquid foods and then progresses to solid foods. As the food gets \naccumulated in the esophagus, patients may complain of halitosis. With further progression of the \ndisease, the patients may develop pneumonia, lung abscess, etc. The initial diagnosis is made by barium swallow or endoscopy, which shows the presence of \ndilated esophagus due to the constriction of the lower esophageal sphincter (bird-beak \nappearance).

Type III achalasia cardia is characterised by massive, simultaneous, high-pressure contractions of \nthe distal esophagus. Achalasia cardia occurs due to the loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of GIT. \nDuring swallowing, the food bolus normally triggers a primary peristaltic wave, which is \nresponsible for carrying the bolus to the stomach, accompanied by the relaxation of the lower \nesophageal sphincter (LES) to allow esophageal emptying into the stomach. Achalasia is characterized by a disruption of this normal process. Failure of relaxation of the \nLES causes an elevated median integrated relaxation pressure and a complete failure of \nperistalsis. The esophagus becomes progressively more tortuous, leading to a megaesophagus.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The patient likely has achalasia cardia and the definitive treatment is Heller's myotomy. Surgical \nmanagement is the first-line treatment modality. Achalasia or 'failure to relax' in Greek occurs due to the lack of ganglion cells in the myenteric \nplexus (Auerbach's). The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax leading to dysphagia, \nregurgitation of food, and progressive dilation of the esophagus proximal to the constriction. Barium radiology shows hold-up in the distal esophagus, abnormal contractions in the \noesophageal body, and a tapering stricture in the distal esophagus often described as a ‘bird’s \nbeak’. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice. Here, the muscles of the lower \nesophagus and cardia are cut. However, this can cause iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) \ndue to damage to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Thus, newer techniques involve a partial \nfundoplication like Dor's procedure to reinforce the sphincter and reduce GERD symptoms. Endoscopic myotomy is a newer, alternate procedure. Here, a submucosal tunnel is formed in the \nmid esophagus region that allows a long myotomy. 380 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Calcium channel blockers can be given in the initial stages of the disease. They relieve \nthe chest pressure that occurs around mealtimes. However, they are not permanent treatments \nand can be used while waiting for surgery. Option B: Botulinum toxin injection can be used as a treatment in patients who may not be \ncandidates for surgery or dilatation. Limitations to botulinum toxin injections are that the effect is \nshort-lived (6-12 months) and patients often require multiple treatments. Option C: Pneumatic dilatation of the LES has is successful in 75% of patients. It involves using a \nballoon to stretch the LES and improve competence. It requires multiple sessions and has a low \nrisk of esophageal perforation.",

      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario with episodes triggered by cold foods and manometric findings are \nsuggestive of a diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). Diffuse esophageal spasm is a hypermotility disorder of the esophagus. It is caused by \nspontaneous, abnormal contractions seen more in the distal two-thirds of the esophageal body. It \nis more common in women. Patients usually present with dysphagia and chest pain. Pathologically, there is marked \nhypertrophy of the circular muscles. It is often triggered by cold foods. It mimics symptoms of \nmyocardial infarction and also shows improvement when sublingual nitroglycerin is administered. \nIt causes smooth muscle relaxation of the esophagus. A barium swallow shows a corkscrew esophagus. However, manometry (high-resolution \nmanometry is preferred) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. In classic manometry, if there are \nsimultaneous, multi-peaked contractions of high amplitude (&gt;120 mmHg) or long duration \n(&gt;2.5 seconds) it is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm. 382 \nSold by @itachibot On high-resolution manometry, a DCI (distal contractile integral) &gt;450 mmHg is suggestive of \nDES.

      "explanation": "Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to improve the clinical outcome of acute corrosive \nesophagitis and are not recommended. Corrosive esophagitis is caused due to the ingestion of alkali or acid and can be accidental or from \nattempted suicide. The injury caused by alkali ingestion is deeper due to the process of saponification of fats and \ndehydration. The injury caused by acids is more superficial because they cause coagulative \nnecrosis with eschar formation, which prevents the deeper penetration of the acid. The acids also cause severe pylorospasm and therefore more gastric damage compared to alkali \ndue to the accumulation of the contents in the antrum. Severe corrosive injury may lead to esophageal perforation, bleeding, stricture, and death. It is a \nrisk factor for esophageal carcinoma. Therefore, early endoscopic evaluation is recommended to \nassess mucosal injuries even if there is no signs of oral injury. 388 \nSold by @itachibot Management of corrosive esophagitis: • Hemodynamic stabilization and management of patient's airway • Endoscopic evaluation of injuries • Surgical management includes laparotomy and • Esophageal stenting and jejunostomy for limited hemorrhage and superficial ulceration • Esophagogastric resection and jejunostomy for extensive necrosis.",

The foreign body in the esophagus can be asymptomatic or may present with \nperforation after ingestion. The radiopaque foreign body can be seen with a chest X-ray (Option \nC).

Spontaneous perforation of the esophagus needs immediate diagnosis and intervention due to the \nhigher mortality associated with it.

Hiatus hernia is the protrusion of any \nabdominal structure other than the esophagus into the thoracic cavity through a widening of the \nhiatus of the diaphragm. Type 1 - sliding hernia: Gastroesophageal junction or cardia migrates into the thoracic cavity. The length of intra \nabdominal esophagus is reduced leading to GERD.

Type 2 - rolling hiatus hernia: Gastroesophageal junction or cardia is normal but a portion of the stomach migrates into the \nthoracic cavity. The length of intra abdominal esophagus remains the same in a true rolling hiatus \nhernia. Clinical features: • Chest pain or fullness relieved on belching. • Dysphagia. • Longitudinal ulcers (Cameron’s ulcer) that bleeds, leading to anemia. Surgical reduction of hernia and tightening of diaphragmatic crura is the best treatment modality \neven in asymptomatic patients to avoid life-threatening complications like volvulus.
