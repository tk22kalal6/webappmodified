The components of the triad are: • Symptoms of hypoglycaemia after fasting or exercise. • Plasma glucose levels &lt;2.8 mmol/L. • Relief of symptoms on intravenous administration of glucose. Patients with insulinoma eat frequently to avoid hypoglycemic symptoms. Hence, weight loss is \nnot a feature of insulinoma.",

        "d": "Reduced basal to maximal acid output ratio"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome/gastrinoma. Here, the basal \nacid output (BAO) is increased. Hence, the BAO:MAO ratio is increased. In these patients, there is gastrin hypersecretion that stimulates gastric acid secretion. This \nleads to peptic ulcers that occur at atypical sites like the duodenum and jejunum and \nare refractory and multiple. Abdominal pain is the most common complaint in these patients. However, diarrhea can occur \ndue to: • Acid-induced injury to the small intestine mucosa • Inability of the intestinal tract to absorb large volumes of fluids secreted by the stomach • Inactivation of pancreatic lipase by low pH • Precipitation of bile salts. The unique characteristic of acid-induced diarrhea is that it is controlled by nasogastric aspiration \nof gastric secretions. 806 \nSold by @itachibot Gastric pH &lt;2.5 and a serum gastrin concentration &gt;1000 pg/mL confirm the diagnosis of \nZollinger Ellison syndrome. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, a secretin stimulation test is done. In this test, the fasting \ngastrin level is measured before secretin (2 IU/kg) is administered intravenously, and subsequent \nsamples are obtained 2, 5, 10, and 20 minutes. Gastrin levels &gt;200 pg/mL after administration \nof secretin are suggestive of gastrinoma.",

The majority of the gastrinomas are found within the Passaro’s triangle and can be detected by \nendoscopic ultrasound (EUS). However, it still misses many of the smaller lesions, and may \nconfuse normal lymph nodes for gastrinomas.
