      "explanation": "The most common site for thyroglossal cyst is infrahyoid region. It can occur anywhere along the migratory course of the duct: • Infrahyoid (most common site) • Region of thyroid cartilage • Suprahyoid • Floor of mouth • Beneath foramen caecum A thyroglossal duct cyst is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during \nchildhood. Normally, the thyroglossal duct regresses once the thyroid gland has completely \ndescended. If it fails to regress, a thyroglossal duct cyst is formed. It can be differentiated from other midline neck swellings by the following features: • Can be moved sideways but not vertically • Moves with both deglutition and tongue protrusion Surgical management of a thyroglossal cyst is via Sistrunk procedure. 284 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Presence of thyroid in the midline posterior 1/3rd of tongue is called lingual thyroid. It is \ndue to failure of descent of the thyroglossal duct during development.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A thyroglossal cyst is the only midline neck swelling that moves with deglutition. This is because \nthe thyroid gland is fixed to the hyoid. Thyroglossal duct cyst: It is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed after \nan upper respiratory infection. It represents the persistence of the track of the thyroid gland and \ncan be found adjacent to the midline. The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base \nof the tongue towards its position in the lower neck. At the time of descent, the hyoid bone has not \nbeen formed and the track of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through, or behind the \neventual position of the hyoid body. Clinical features of thyroglossal cyst: • Classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicates \nattachment to the hyoid bone. • Swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), nontender, mobile, often transilluminant. • Thyroid fossa is empty, if there is no thyroid in the normal location. Complications of thyroglossal cyst: • The most common complication is infection. • Thyroglossal fistula is an acquired condition that either follows infection of the cyst which bursts \nopen or due to inadequate removal of the cyst. • 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts are found to be malignant of which the most common type \nof cancer is papillary (85%). 285 \nSold by @itachibot Neck swellings that move with deglutition are: • Thyroid swellings • Subhyoid bursitis • Dermoid cysts attached to the hyoid bone However, only the thyroglossal cyst moves with tongue protrusion. This is because the duct \nextends from the foramen caecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the gland. Sistrunk’s operation is performed to excise the cyst and prevent a recurrence. It involves the \nexcision of the whole thyroglossal tract, involving removal of the body of the hyoid bone, \nand suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen \ncaecum along with the core of tissue on either side.",

It \nis also known as struma lymphomatosa or lymphocytic thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune disease \nthat results in the destruction of the thyroid gland and gradual &amp; progressive thyroid failure. Clinical features: • Most prevalent between 45-65 years of age • More common in females • Painless enlargement of the thyroid • Hashitoxicosis: When the auto-antibodies attack and damage the follicles, there is a sudden \nrelease of thyroid hormones from these follicles. This leads to a transient phase of thyrotoxicosis. • Hypothyroidism: Since the follicles are damaged and cannot form the hormones anymore, these \npatients tend to be in a state of hypothyroidism. Diagnosis: • T3 and T4 are low • TSH is raised • Autoantibodies against: • Thyroid receptors • Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) • Thyroglobulin These patients are managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In patients with long-standing goiter, there is a risk of compressive features and the development \nof thyroid lymphoma. Such cases can be treated with total thyroidectomy.

The given slide below shows medullary carcinoma of thyroid: 292 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism due to \ncirculating autoantibodies.

De Quervain’s thyroiditis (subacute or viral thyroiditis) is a granulomatous enlargement of the \nthyroid gland, usually following a viral infection. It is an inflammatory condition and not an \ninfection as the thyroid gland is inherently resistant to infection due to its extensive blood and \nlymphatic supply, high iodide content, and fibrous capsule. It predominantly occurs in women between the ages of 30-40 years. The condition is self-limiting, \nand management is symptomatic i.e. aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are \nused for pain relief, but steroids may be indicated in more severe cases. Note: Acute suppurative thyroiditis mimics De Quervain’s thyroiditis in that it is often preceded \nby a pyogenic upper respiratory tract infection or otitis media.

      "explanation": "Most of the retrosternal goiters can be removed by neck incision (transcervical approach). Retrosternal goitre is defined as having &gt;50% of the goiter below the suprasternal notch. It can \nbe either primary or secondary. • Primary: rare and arises from ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum; receives blood supply \nfrom intrathoracic blood vessels. It is not related to thyroid tissue in the neck. • Secondary: they are the most common type; an extension of enlarged thyroid from the neck, \nusually arising from the lower pole of nodular goitre. It receives its blood supply from superior \nand inferior thyroid vessels. The majority of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms. If the gland enlarges \nwithin the thoracic inlet, the pressure may lead to dysphagia, tracheal compression, and \neventually airway symptoms. Pemberton sign can be positive (facial flushing and dilatation of \ncervical veins upon raising the arms above the head). CECT neck and thorax is the investigation of choice. Over 95% of retrosternal goiters can be removed via a transcervical incision since they are an \nextension from thyroid tissue in the neck. Other options: Option A: Surgical removal of the retrosternal goiter is indicated in patients with significant \nairway compression, and in young patients who have symptoms such as dyspnoea or dysphagia. 296 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Median sternotomy approach is indicated in: • Primary mediastinal goiter • Malignant retrosternal goitre • Very large retrosternal goiter • Recurrence in the mediastinum For a primary mediastinal goiter whose boundaries are completely within the chest, resection is \noften achieved through median sternotomy or thoracotomy to ensure that the vessels supplying \nthe tumor are properly ligated. Removing the tumor through a cervical approach can result in \nuncontrolled bleeding and is generally avoided.

      "explanation": "The usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy is inadequate patient preparation before \nsurgery. Patient preparation pre-operatively involves ensuring a euthyroid state. Rough handling of the thyroid in thyroidectomy does not cause a thyroid storm. Though a \nsignificant amount of thyroglobulin is stored in the acinar cells, they are inactive unless converted \nto thyroxine (T3 and T4). 297 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "The last dose of carbimazole must be given 24 hours before surgery"

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The last dose of carbimazole may be given the evening before surgery. Toxic adenoma is a benign functioning thyroid tumour, which usually presents as a toxic solitary \nnodule. It is an autonomously functioning tumour that does not respond to TSH. Treatment \ninvolves antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine. This is followed by hemithyroidectomy as the \nsurrounding normal thyroid tissue regains normal function. Traditional preparation of a thyrotoxic patient aims to make the patient biochemically euthyroid. \nThere are two methods of preparation that can be used: • Carbimazole 30-40 mg per day is the drug of choice. When euthyroid (after 8-12 weeks), the dose \nmay be reduced. Beta-blockers, if used preoperatively, must be given on the morning of surgery \nand continued for a week post-op. • Propranolol 40 mg TDS or a longer-acting nadolol 160 mg once daily may be given to achieve \nbeta-blockade. It is important to continue treatment up to 7 days postoperatively. Iodine may be given with carbimazole or a beta-blocker 10 days before the operation. It produces \ntransient remission and reduces thyroid vascularity.",
