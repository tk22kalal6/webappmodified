      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Lymphedema is the most probable cause of long-standing non-pitting edema in the limbs. Lymphedema is the abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial spaces of the \ntissues. Lymphedema can be primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema includes: • Lymphedema congenita (0-2 years): more common in males, involves multiple limbs, face, and \ngenitalia. It can be familial or sporadic. The familial type is called Nonne Milroy syndrome. • Lymphedema praecox (2-35 years): more common in females, the most common type of primary \nlymphedema with a peak incidence in puberty. It can be familial or sporadic. The familial type is \ncalled Meig's disease. • Lymphedema tarda (&gt;35 years): Rare and uncommon. Secondary lymphedema is more common than primary and is the most common cause of \nlymphedema overall. Causes include lymph node dissection (axillary or inguinal), \npost-mastectomy, postoperative radiotherapy, obesity, varicose vein surgery, and trauma. Complications of lymphedema include infections, skin changes, recurent cellulitis, non-healing \nulcers, and lymphangiosarcoma. Treatment mostly includes patient education and nonsurgical interventions, which include limb \nelevation, and external compressive garments. When the above methods fail, surgery can be 1234 \nSold by @itachibot considered.",

      "explanation": "1236 \nSold by @itachibot Direct contrast lymphangiography is done by dissecting the lymphatic vasculature through an \nincision on the dorsum of the foot and injecting contrast. Direct contrast lymphangiography is an invasive study done to visualise the lymphatic system.

Marjolin's ulcer may also develop in chronic long standing venous ulcers but are not seen \nin chronic lymphedema. 1237 \nSold by @itachibot Initially, the lymphedema is soft and pits on the pressure but with time the skin becomes \nthickened and non-pitting due to fibrosis, dermal thickening, and hyperkeratosis. Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. This is due to loss of local immune \ndefense mechanisms. Chronic eczema, the fungal infection of skin and nails, fissuring, verrucae, \nand papillae (warts) are frequently seen in advanced disease. Rarely malignancy (lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma) may occur in chronic lymphedema. \nThis neoplastic transformation of blood vessels and lymphatics is called Stewart-Treves syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Anterior compartment is the most common site of lymphoma in the mediastinum. Other sites \ninclude the middle compartment and hilar nodes. Primary mediastinal lymphoma is an uncommon type of lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), \nprimary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma are the most \ncommon primary mediastinal lymphomas. In about 50% of patients who have both Hodgkin’s and \nNon-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, the mediastinum may be the primary site. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome refers to symptoms produced by the obstruction of blood flow \nthrough the SVC by the enlarging mediastinal mass, resulting in symptoms of dyspnea, facial and \nupper-extremity edema, cough, chest pain, and dysphagia. Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is used to obtain a biopsy of the mediastinal mass for \nconfirmation and diagnosis. Chemotherapy with six cycles of R-CHOP regimen is preferred. Rituximab is a chimeric \nmonoclonal anti-CD20 antibody and has become a standard component of treating all B-cell \nlymphoma histologies that express CD20.

      "explanation": "The given image depicts a lymphangioma, also known as cystic hygroma. They are brilliantly \ntransilluminant. Lymphangiomas are congenital benign tumors of the lymphatic system. They are the isolated \ncystic mass of lymphatic tissue that has the ability to produce lymph. Over time the tumor \nenlarges due to the accumulation of lymph within the cyst. Types of lymphangiomas: • Simple or capillary lymphangioma: They occur subcutaneously in the head, neck, and axilla. \nThey may also occur within the internal organs and connective tissues in the thoracic and \nabdominal cavities. • Cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma: They also occur in the neck or axilla. Rarely they \nmay occur in retroperitoneum. 1238 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment includes surgical excision of the tumor and image-guided sclerotherapy. If there is any residual lymphatic malformation after the treatment, then a conservative excision \nor unroofing of the cyst is done.

      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette and the image are suggestive of post-mastectomy lymphedema \ninvolving the upper limb. Lymphoedema occurs when interstitial fluid accumulates due to defective lymphatic drainage. It \nis a common complication of breast cancer treatment involving axillary lymph node \ndissection and radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) reduces the risk of 1239 \nSold by @itachibot lymphedema significantly. Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in the limb \nsize due to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb \nfatigue, and reduced limb mobility. Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm \n&gt;2 centimeters than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or \ngreater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria. Management: Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices can help reduce \nswelling. Dry skin can be seen due to fluid accumulation, which can lead to cellulitis/skin infections. Using \na low pH water-based moisturizer is helpful. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) by \nthe patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation. Benzpyrones and flavonoids are some naturally occurring substances that may be of use to treat \nlymphedema. Surgical options are lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking. Other options: Option B: Stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standing \nlymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years).

Option C: Axillary venous thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorous \nexercise and in weightlifters. The subclavian vein is compressed at the thoracic outlet.
