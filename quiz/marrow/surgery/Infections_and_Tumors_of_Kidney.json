      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "899 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute pyelonephritis. Patients with acute pyelonephritis \nare more likely to have struvite stones, not uric acid stones. This is because of infection \nwith urea-splitting organisms such as proteus that release ammonia. This makes the urine \nalkaline and promotes the formation of struvite stones. Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidneys. Ascending \ninfection in the urinary tract is the most common route. It is more common in young, sexually \nactive women. Up to 50% of children with urinary infections have an underlying anatomical \nabnormality (e.g., reflux or obstruction). Clinical features include: • Prodromal symptoms such as headache, lassitude, vomiting • Flank pain, fever, rigor • Pyuria and occasionally hematuria CECT abdomen is the investigation of choice to rule out pyonephrosis. The mainstay of treatment is broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent renal scarring. Surgery is \nindicated only if antibiotic therapy fails.",

      "explanation": "The given history with Murphy's punch sign positive, and streaks of gas on CECT abdomen point \nto a diagnosis of emphysematous pyelonephritis. Escherichia coli is the most common causative \norganism. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is associated with an acute necrotizing infection of the kidney by \ngas-producing organisms that occurs predominantly in diabetic patients. E. coli produces carbon \ndioxide by the fermentation of sugar. Patients frequently present with sepsis and ketoacidosis. It can be associated with tenderness at \nthe costovertebral angle known as Murphy's punch sign. CECT abdomen shows an enlarged destructed renal parenchyma with small linear streaks of gas. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with drainage. In patients who fail to respond to \ntreatment, nephrectomy is considered. Note: Clostridium species are the most common causative organisms in emphysematous \ncholecystitis. Murphy's punch sign is also seen in infection, inflammation, or obstruction of the kidney.

Subcapsular nephrectomy is the preferred treatment \nin patients with XGP. It is a form of chronic pyelonephritis seen most frequently in middle-aged diabetic women and, \nrarely, in children. XGP is most commonly caused by proteus followed by E. coli. The disease is \nusually unilateral and is associated with prolonged obstructing nephrolithiasis.

      "explanation": "The clinical features of a ballotable renal mass with hematuria in a 3-year-old child are suggestive \nof Wilms tumor and FNAC is not done in this condition. Investigations in suspected cases of Wilms tumor: • Laboratory study - shows hematuria, polycythemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated APTT • USG with doppler study of renal veins - for evaluation of the collecting system and to look for \ntumor thrombi in renal veins and inferior vena cava • CECT abdomen - to identify the extent of the disease, to access the contralateral kidney, and for \nmetastasis • MRI - not used routinely as it requires sedation • Positron emission tomography(PET) scan - to identify regional spread and metastatic lesions Diagnosis should be made by imaging studies and it is confirmed after nephrectomy. A biopsy is \ndiscouraged in this condition as it results in disease upstaging. Only in cases with atypical \npresentation such as older age, signs of infection, etc, or with unusual imaging findings a core \nneedle biopsy via the posterior approach can be performed. Note: Neuroblastoma also presents similar to Wilms tumor. It is commonly seen in children of \npreschool age. Affected children commonly present with a palpable abdominal mass and the most \ncommon site of the tumor is the retroperitoneum. Therefore, this disease becomes an important \ndifferential diagnosis. So we should also test for the presence of vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) in \nthis patient to exclude this tumor.",
