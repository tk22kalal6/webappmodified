      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Frequent transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation accounts for more than 90% of \nthe cases of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that develops when there is a retrograde \nflow of stomach contents back into the esophagus. It can present as non-erosive reflux disease or \nerosive esophagitis. A hiatal hernia is the next common cause of GERD. Factors contributing to the high pressure in \nthe LES zone: Factors contributing to the high pressure in the LES zone: • Intrinsic musculature of the distal esophagus and sling fibers of the cardia of stomach which are \nin tonic contraction • During inspiration, the anterposterior diameter of the crural opening of diaphragm is decreased \n(increases LES pressure) 400 \nSold by @itachibot • Transmitted pressure of the abdominal cavity on the LES zone",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Protein increases the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, thereby allowing the closure of \nthe sphincter and reducing reflux. Other options: Option A: Chocolate and coffee both contain methylxanthine, which causes muscles to relax and \nlowers the LES pressure. In addition, coffee can stimulate gastric secretions, which can promote \nreflux. Option C: Fatty foods have been found to delay gastric emptying and decrease the LES pressure, \nthereby prolonging the esophageal exposure time to the stomach acid and the volume available for \nreflux. Option D: Alcohol, mint, citrus, tomatoes, and/or carbonated beverages may cause further \nirritation to the damaged esophageal mucosa but have not been found to cause reflux themselves.",

Globus hystericus or globus pharyngeus is a persistent abnormal sensation in the throat in the \nabsence of any observable pathology. The exact cause of globus sensation is uncertain.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with X-ray findings showing a retrocardiac gas bubble are consistent \nwith the diagnosis of a hiatus hernia. A CT scan with oral contrast is the best method of \ndiagnosis. It highlights the gastric anatomy but also helps to identify other structures involved in \nthe hiatal hernia. Hiatus hernia is the protrusion of any abdominal structure other than the esophagus into the \nthoracic cavity through a widening of the hiatus of the diaphragm. Types of hiatus hernia: Type 1- sliding hernia Gastroesophageal junction or cardia migrates into the thoracic cavity. The length of intra \nabdominal esophagus is reduced leading to GERD. Most of the patients are asymptomatic. The \ntreatment of choice in symptomatic patients is fundoplication. Type 2- rolling hiatus hernia: Gastroesophageal junction or cardia is normal but a portion of the stomach migrates into the \nthoracic cavity. The length of the intraabdominal esophagus remains the same in a true rolling \nhiatus hernia. Clinical features: • Chest pain or fullness relieved on belching. • Dysphagia. • Longitudinal ulcers (Cameron’s ulcer) that bleed lead to anemia. Surgical reduction of hernia and tightening of diaphragmatic crura is the best treatment modality \neven in asymptomatic patients to avoid life-threatening complications like volvulus. Type 3- mixed hiatus hernia: A combination of sliding and rolling hiatus hernia. Treatment is the same as rolling hiatus hernia. Type 4 hiatus hernia: Other contents of GIT herniates into the thoracic cavity. Eg: Colon. 402 \nSold by @itachibot Note: This is a controversial question as some books give barium swallow as the investigation of \nchoice for hiatal hernia. But Bailey's 28th edition clearly mentions that a CT scan with oral \ncontrast is the answer. The image below shows a retrocardiac gas bubble on an X-ray that is consistent with hiatus \nhernia.",

      "explanation": "Mucus-secreting goblet cells (not foveolar cells) are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus, as there \nis intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus. Foveolar cells are the mucus-secreting cells in the \nstomach. Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and it \nis estimated to occur in about 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Symptoms include \nheartburn, regurgitation and sometimes dysphagia. Obese white men over the age of 60 \nyears represent the highest-risk group. Intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus occurs due to chronic irritation of the esophagus in GERD \n(option A) since intestinal epithelium is better suited to handling gastric acid exposure. Hence, \nmucus-secreting goblet cells are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus. Since all metaplasia are \nreversible, Barrett's esophagus is also reversible (option D). Only 0.2 to 1% of Barrett's esophagus \nleads to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Alician blue is used in the staining of the biopsy specimen, as it stains the goblet cells (option C). \nMucicarmine is the specific stain.

A gastric pull-up is done during esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma. It is a surgical \nprocedure where the stomach is pulled up into the thoracic cavity that now acts as a new passage \n(conduit) instead of the esophagus. During the esophagectomy, the proximal stomach and lymph nodes are typically resected along \nwith the segment of the esophagus.
