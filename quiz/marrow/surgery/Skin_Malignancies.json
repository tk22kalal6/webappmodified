      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history with the image showing an ulcer over the face with pearly, rolled-out borders \npoints to a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an epithelial tumor arising from basal cells. It is the most common \ntype of skin cancer most commonly seen over the face, above the line joining corner of the mouth, \nand lobule of the ear. Risk factors for BCC include ultraviolet radiation (strongest risk factor), age \n40-80 years with excessive sun exposure, light-skinned people, and exposure to arsenic \ncompounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and infrared light. It is more common in males than \nfemales. It is also associated with syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Gorlin's \nsyndrome. Features of BCC include: • Pearly nodule with rolled border • Tortuous telangiectatic vessels • Surface which can get ulcerated with raised and beaded edge, often with a central depression or \numbilication • Bleeding on minor trauma BCC has various subtypes such as nodular (most common type), pigmented, nodulocystic, \nmorphoeic, infiltrative, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus. 1257 \nSold by @itachibot It is locally aggressive and can erode the bone or facial sinuses. It rarely metastasizes via lymph \nnodes. The occasional presence of melanin in the nodular variant of BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to \nconfusion with melanoma. Depending upon the type of the lesion, a shave, punch or excisional biopsy may be employed for \ndiagnosis. X-ray or CT may be needed if there is a local invasion. Histology shows peripheral \npalisading of cells. Treatment: • Surgical: Wide excision (4-6 mm clearance) with a skin graft or flap or primary suturing • Mohs' surgery for BCC close to the eyes, nose, or ear to preserve more tissue. • Non-surgical: Radiotherapy, vismodegib and sonedegib. Other options: Option A: Dermatofibrosarcoma, also known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a \nrare, slow-growing, well-differentiated primary fibrosarcoma of the skin, associated with increased \nproduction of platelet-derived growth factor-beta. It presents as a protuberant nodule within a \nfirm, indurated plaque that can ulcerate. They are locally aggressive tumors with high recurrence \nrates. Treatment is wide excision and Mohs microscopic surgery. Imatinib is used for \nunresectable, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. The given image below shows a DFSP near the \numbilicus. Option B: Marjolin's ulcer is a painless, slow-growing, locally malignant, well-differentiated \nsquamous cell carcinoma that occurs in a chronic scar (burns scar, scar of venous ulcer). It \npresents as an indurated, non-tender ulcer with raised and everted edges with scarring in the \nsurrounding area with marked fibrosis. The ulcer can spread to the lymph nodes when it reaches \nthe normal skin. A wedge biopsy and MRI of the region involved confirm the diagnosis. \nManagement is by wide excision, for larger ulcers, amputation is done. The given image below \nshows a marjolin's ulcer of the leg. 1258 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Naevus is a common benign neoplasm caused due to mutations in the components of \nthe RAS signaling pathway. It has various types, such as congenital naevus, blue naevus, Spitz \nnaevus, halo naevus, and dysplastic naevus. The given image below shows a patient with multiple \ndysplastic nevi.",

It arises from the nail matrix, \nmost commonly in the great toe or thumb. 1263 \nSold by @itachibot Hutchinson's nail sign is an important clinical clue to subungual melanoma. It is characterized by \nthe extension of brown or black pigment from the nail bed, matrix, and nail plate to the adjacent \ncuticle and proximal or lateral nail folds. It is also associated with nail dystrophy. Note: Pseudo-Hutchison’s sign is a reflection of the pigmentation of the nail bed and nail matrix \nthrough the transparent nail folds. Option A: Subungal hematoma is a close differential of subungual melanoma. It is seen secondary \nto trauma which causes bleeding and resultant hematoma formation and pigmentation. It is \nimportant to note that the features of Hutchinson's nail sign are not seen with subungual \nhematoma. Option B: Nodular melanoma is a condition where malignant melanoma cells proliferate \ndownwards through the skin – this is known as vertical growth. The lesion presents as \na nodule that has been rapidly enlarging. 1264 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma, in which the malignant cells are \nconfined to the tissue of origin, the epidermis, hence it is often reported as in-situ melanoma. Note: Subungual melanoma can be either superficial spreading melanoma or acral lentiginous \nmelanoma. A difference of opinion has been noted in Bailey and Love, 27th ed. where it has been \nmentioned that melanoma under the fingernail is usually superficial spreading \nmelanoma.

As a result of this, there will be more time \nto detect them before they enter the vertical phase of growth. Thus LMM and ALM have a better \nprognosis than other subtypes. The SSM has an intermediate prognosis, as the horizontal phase is rapidly followed by the vertical \nphase. The NM has the worst prognosis, as there is no horizontal phase and it starts with a vertical \ngrowth phase. This leads to a greater average tumor thickness. 1266 \nSold by @itachibot",

Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) can be primary or secondary. • Primary EMPD is more common and occurs in the absence of an underlying malignancy, \nthought to arise from intraepidermal parts of apocrine glands or from pluripotent cells from the \nepidermis. • Secondary EMPD arises from an underlying adnexal carcinoma or internal malignancy due to \nthe epidermotropic spread of malignant cells from the underlying tumor. Visceral malignancies associated with EMPD are carcinomas of the colon, rectum, bladder, \nurethra, cervix, and prostate. The patient presents with well-defined, moist, erythematous scaly \nplaques and severe pruritis. Lichenification and excoriations may also be seen. Diagnosis is confirmed by punch, wedge, or excisional skin biopsy. A systemic workup should also \nbe done to identify any underlying malignancy and they include colonoscopy, cystoscopy, \ncolposcopy, and pelvic examination with pap smear in females.

Approximately 25% of the cases are associated with an underlying in situ or invasive \nneoplasm. It most commonly presents with pruritus.
