      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas. During embryogenesis, the developing pancreatic ducts usually fuse in such a way that most of the \ndorsal duct drains into the proximal part of the ventral duct. The proximal portion of the dorsal \nduct usually persists as an accessory duct. In about 10% of the population, there is a failure of fusion of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic \nbuds leading to a condition called pancreatic divisum (pancreas divisum). Pancreatic drainage is \naccomplished mainly through the accessory papilla. Since most of the pancreatic exocrine secretions exit through the dorsal duct, the pancreas \ndivisum can lead to a partial obstruction due to the small minor papilla, leading to the \ndevelopment of relapsing acute or chronic pancreatitis",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "MRCP is more advantageous than ERCP in diagnosing pancreatic divisum. This is because, \nMRCP can delineate the entire dorsal pancreatic duct, whereas ERCP can assess only the ventral \nduct on cannulation of the major duodenal papilla. The diagnosis of pancreatic divisum can also be made by EUS, or ERCP, augmented by injection \nof secretin if necessary. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting of the minor papilla relieve the symptoms. Surgical \nintervention may involve sphincteroplasty, pancreatojejunostomy (Puestow procedure), or even \nresection of the pancreatic head.

      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is suggestive of annular pancreas, which is a type of developmental \nanomaly leading to duodenal compression. Laparotomy with a thorough gross examination of the \nduodenum and the head of the pancreas is the gold standard test for an annular pancreas, not an \nMRCP. The annular pancreas is due to result of the failure of the complete rotation of the ventral \npancreatic bud. During development, a ring of pancreatic tissue surrounds the second or third \npart of the duodenum. It is most often seen in association with congenital duodenal atresia and is, therefore, more \nprevalent in children with Down’s syndrome. 818 \nSold by @itachibot Duodenal obstruction typically causes non-projectile, non-bilious vomiting in neonates. Plain abdominal radiographs may demonstrate the classic double bubble sign. But it is \nnon-specific for the annular pancreas. Despite many advances in diagnostic techniques such as CT \nscan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), MRCP, and ERCP, the gold standard test for diagnosing AP \nremains to be laparotomy. It involves a thorough gross examination of the duodenum and the \nhead of the pancreas. The treatment for an annular pancreas is a duodenal bypass procedure (duodenoduodenostomy).",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with characteristic lab findings is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. \nCECT abdomen is not always necessary to diagnose acute pancreatitis. According to the revised Atlanta classification, acute pancreatitis is clinically defined by at least \nthe first two of three features: • abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis (epigastric pain often radiating to the back), • serum amylase and lipase levels  3 times normal (imaging is to be used if the elevated values \nare less than 3 times normal); and • characteristic imaging findings on CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, or transabdominal \nultrasonographic (US) studies. If acute pancreatitis is diagnosed on the basis of the first two criteria with no systemic sign of \nsevere systemic inflammatory response syndrome or persistent organ failure, contrast material–\nenhanced CT may not be necessary for determining patient care. Option B: The optimal time for performance of contrast-enhanced CT imaging in cases of acute \npancreatitis is more than 72 hours from the onset of symptoms.

It includes respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal systems scores. A score of more \nthan 2 for any organs indicates organ failure. Revised Atlanta classification recommends the \nmodified Marshall scoring system as the main tool in determining organ failure. Option D: Current evidence confirms that the administration of enteral nutrition is beneficial for \nthe treatment of severe acute pancreatitis.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a history of pancreatitis, elevated WBC, and CT scan findings are \nsuggestive of pancreatic abscess. It is treated by percutaneous drainage. A pancreatic abscess is a circumscribed intra-abdominal collection of pus, usually in proximity to \nthe pancreas. It may be an acute fluid collection or walled-off necrosis that has become infected. 825 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical features include: • Fever with chills • Elevated white blood cell count • Abdominal pain Contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI are both options for the assessment of pancreatic necrosis \nand abscesses. On imaging, the presence of extraluminal gas in the pancreatic and/or \nperipancreatic tissues is consistent with an underlying infection. Treatment is by percutaneous drainage with the widest possible drains placed under imaging \nguidance, along with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.",

CT scan has to be performed in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, organ failure, sepsis, and \nin patients with clinical deterioration despite the treatment: • If the CT scan shows the presence of sterile pancreatic necrosis medical management is \nrecommended. • If the CT scan shows the presence of necrosis with evidence of infection, then ultrasound or \nCT-guided aspiration of the fluid has to be done and the fluid is sent for staining and culture. Infected pancreatic necrosis is treated by the administration of intravenous antibiotics (preferably \ncarbapenems) and percutaneous drainage of the infected fluid. Pancreatic necrosectomy is be \nconsidered in the patients if the clinical condition worsens despite percutaneous drainage.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a handlebar injury and the CT scan showing transection of the \nbody of the pancreas are suggestive pancreatic injury. Plasma amylase levels are not sensitive in \npancreatic injuries. The most common mechanism of pancreatic injury in children is blunt trauma (because of the \ndecreased amount of fat and incomplete protection of the rib cage). In adults, penetrating injuries \nare the most common cause. Involvement of other organs is also likely to be seen. Direct compression of the epigastrium against the vertebral column and a blunt object (handlebar) \nis typically seen after bicycle injuries. The most common segment of the pancreas affected is the \nbody. Patients usually present with epigastric pain. In some cases, a delayed presentation may be due to \nleakage of pancreatic fluids. The modality of choice is the CT scan of the abdomen. If there is doubt about duct disruption, an \nurgent ERCP or MRCP should be done. Surgery is indicated if the main pancreatic duct is disrupted. A damage control procedure with \npacking and drainage should be performed initially and the patient referred for definitive surgery \nafter stabilization. Definitive management includes: • Distal pancreatectomy - If the body or tail is involved • External drainage - If the head of the pancreas is involved • Pancreatoduodenectomy - If the pancreatic head and duodenum is involved 827 \nSold by @itachibot Chronic Pancreatitis",
