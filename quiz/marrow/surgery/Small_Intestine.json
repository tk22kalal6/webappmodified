      "explanation": "The jejunum receives its blood supply from long, straight vasa recta arising from only one or two \narcades. The blood supply to the ileum may have 4-5 separate arcades with shorter vasa recta. The ligament of Treitz or the suspensory muscle of the duodenum is found at the junction of the \nduodenum and jejunum. It also forms the line of demarcation for gastrointestinal bleeding: • Upper GI bleeding - refers to bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz • Lower GI bleeding - refers to bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. 484 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is suggestive of intestinal obstruction, due to a strangulated inguinal \nhernia. The ideal management is exploratory laparotomy as soon as possible with ongoing \nresuscitative measures until surgery. Bowel strangulation is a type of mechanical bowel obstruction, associated with complete cessation \nof blood supply leading to irreversible loss of viability of the affected bowel segment. Inguinal \nhernias, most commonly of non-reducible type, are associated with a high chance of strangulation \nand need urgent medical intervention. Bowel strangulation can be suspected in the presence of • constant severe abdominal pain, • abdominal tenderness with rigidity and peritonism, • signs of shock, and lack of response to conservative management. • Reduced bowel wall enhancement on CT When strangulation occurs in an external hernia, the lump is tense, tender, and irreducible with \noverlying skin changes (erythema or purplish discoloration). Supportive management: • IV fluids • Nasogastric tube to decompress the bowel and reduce abdominal distention • IV antibiotics (adequate coverage required for gram -ve and anaerobes) 486 \nSold by @itachibot • Analgesia Definitive management: • Continue supportive management up to 72 hrs if suspicious of adhesions. Surgical exploration \nand adhesiolysis should be done if there is no improvement. • Immediate surgical exploration and resection of non-viable gut segments if suspicious of any of \nthe following: • Obstructed external hernia • Clinical features suspicious of intestinal strangulation • Obstruction in a ‘virgin’ abdomen (i.e no prior history of intraabdominal surgery)",

      "explanation": "The clinical vignette and the USG showing the doughnut sign (target sign) are suggestive of \npostoperative intussusception and the most likely location is ileoileal in postoperative cases. Intussusception occurs when a portion of the alimentary tract is telescoped into an adjacent \nsegment. The most common location of intussusception is ileocolic. However, ileoileal is the most \ncommon location of intussusception postoperatively and in Henoch–Schönlein Purpura. Causes of intussusception are: • Idiopathic (most common cause in children) • Pathological lead points such as enlarged submucosal Peyer's patch, lymphoma, intestinal polyp, \nleiomyomas, etc. • Meckel's diverticulum • A recent upper GI or respiratory infection, rotavirus vaccination has also shown some \nassociation with intussusception in children. The characteristic clinical triad includes: • Pain • Palpable sausage-shaped mass 487 \nSold by @itachibot • Red currant jelly stools USG findings in intussusception include: • Target sign (also known as the doughnut sign)- The appearance is generated by concentric \nalternating echogenic (submucosa and serosa) with hypoechogenic bands (muscularis propria). • Pseudokidney sign: this is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel: • the edematous bowel resembles renal parenchyma and • the mesentery which is dragged into the intussusception resembles the renal hilum. • Crescent in a doughnut sign. Barium enema shows the characteristic coiled spring appearance. Treatment: • Reduction of intussusception should be done immediately after the diagnosis. • Radiologic hydrostatic reduction has a success rate of 80-95% in cases of ileocolic \nintussusception • Surgical reduction is only done in the presence of refractory shock, suspected bowel necrosis or \nperforation, peritonitis, and multiple recurrences.

Meckel’s diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small \nintestine. Meckel’s diverticulum is caused by a failure of normal regression of the vitelline duct or \nomphalomesenteric duct that develops during weeks 5 to 7 of gestation. It contains all 3 layers of \nthe intestine and hence it is a true diverticulum. It is located 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The most common heterotopic tissue \nwithin the Meckel’s diverticulum is gastric mucosa (50%) followed by pancreatic mucosa(5%) and \ncolonic mucosa. Most Meckel’s diverticula are benign and are incidentally discovered. Its clinical features include: • Gastrointestinal bleeding (most common) • Intestinal obstruction, which may occur as: • Volvulus • Intussusception (ileo-ileal or ileo-colic) • Incarcerated Littre’s hernia.

The sensitivity of the Tc-pertechnate scan is increased by: 491 \nSold by @itachibot • Glucagon: Relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. This decreases peristalsis, \ncausing enhanced detection of the ectopic gastric mucosa in Meckel's diverticulum • Pentagastrin: Potent stimulator of gastric secretions. Increases uptake and secretion of \npertechnetate by the gastric mucosa • Cimetidine: Increases radionuclide uptake, and decreases peptic secretion and the release of \npertechnetate from the diverticular lumen.

Treatment is by antibiotics, usually chloramphenicol. Perforation requires surgery to wash out and close the ulcer. Intestinal resection is usually \navoided. In unstable patients, with evidence of septic shock, the bowel should be exteriorized and \nthe perforation closed after recovery.

The return of normal motility post-surgery occurs in the following sequence: Small intestine (within the first 24 hours)  Stomach (within 48 hours)  Colon (3 to 5 days). Paralytic ileus is an adynamic/functional obstruction in which there is a failure of transmission of \nperistaltic waves. This is secondary to neuromuscular failure in the myenteric (Auerbach’s) and \nsubmucous (Meissner’s) plexuses. Since there are no rigorous contractions, there is no colicky \npain. The resultant stasis leads to the following clinical features: • Abdominal distension - marked and tympanitic • Effortless vomiting • Absence of bowel sounds • Absolute constipation Paralytic ileus takes on clinical significance if any of the following are observed at 72 hours after \nlaparotomy after handling of the bowel: • No return of bowel sounds on auscultation • No passage of flatus Radiologically, the abdomen shows gas-filled loops of the intestine with multiple air fluid levels in \nan erect X-ray.
