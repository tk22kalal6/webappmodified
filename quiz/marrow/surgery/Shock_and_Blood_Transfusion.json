Shock is defined as a systemic state of low tissue perfusion which is inadequate for normal cellular \nrespiration.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The compensatory mechanism in shock reduces the perfusion to the skin, muscle and \ngastrointestinal tract and not to the kidney. As shock progresses, the body’s cardiovascular and endocrine compensatory responses reduce the \nblood flow to non-essential organs by vasoconstriction. This occurs in order to preserve preload \nand flow to the kidneys, lungs and brain.",

Shock due to cardiac tamponade is primarily an example of \nobstructive shock. 32 \nSold by @itachibot Obstructive shock is characterized by a reduction in preload due to mechanical obstruction of the \ncardiac filling of the left and/or right sides of the heart, which in turn leads to fall in cardiac \noutput. Common causes of obstructive shock include: • Cardiac tamponade • Tension pneumothorax • Massive pulmonary embolus or air embolus Cardiogenic shock is due to primary failure of the heart to pump blood. It may be due to \nmyocardial depression as a result of infarction, cardiomyopathy, blunt myocardial injury. Patients \nwith cardiac tamponade may eventually develop cardiogenic shock as the myocardium is stressed \nagainst the obstruction.",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of the presence of hypotension associated with the spinal cord injury is \nsuggestive of neurogenic shock. It is associated with bradycardia and not tachycardia. Neurogenic shock refers to reduced tissue perfusion due to loss of vasomotor tone to peripheral \narterial beds. Neurogenic shock is usually secondary to spinal cord injuries due to vertebral body fractures of \nthe cervical or high thoracic region that disrupts the sympathetic regulation of peripheral vascular \ntone. Loss of vasoconstrictor impulses results in increased vascular capacitance, decreased venous \nreturn and decreased cardiac output. The classic description of neurogenic shock consists of: • Hypotension associated with bradycardia (absence of reflexive tachycardia due to disrupted \nsympathetic discharge) • Warm extremities (due to loss of peripheral vasoconstriction) 33 \nSold by @itachibot • Motor and sensory deficits indicative of a spinal cord injury • Radiographic evidence of a vertebral column fracture",

In distributive (septic) shock, the peripheries are warm and capillary refill will be brisk, despite \nthe profound shock. In early stages (compensated stage) of septic shock, the patient has clammy, warm \nperipheries. The latter is a distinct feature from other types of shock where peripheral \nvasoconstriction leads to cold peripheries. The patient will have decreased vascular resistance, \ninadequate afterload, abnormally high cardiac output, and tachycardia.

Septic shock is also known as vasodilatory shock (But remember vasopressors are not the first \nline). Management protocol for septic shock: Step 1: Immediate evaluation - Securing the airway (if indicated) and correcting hypoxemia and \nestablishing venous access for the early administration of fluids and antibiotics are priorities in \nthe management of patients with sepsis and septic shock. Step 2: Initial resuscitative therapy - aggressive administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), usually \ncrystalloids are given at 30 mL/kg (actual body weight) within the first three hours following the \npresentation. Empirical antibiotic therapy started within first hour. Step 3: Intravenous vasopressors are useful in patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate \nfluid resuscitation or who develop cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Vasopressor agents such as phenylephrine, noradrenaline are indicated in distributive shock \nstates which include septic shock, neurogenic shock, etc. where there is peripheral vasodilatation, \nand a low systemic vascular resistance, leading to hypotension. But they are not the first-line \ntreatment. 35 \nSold by @itachibot",

TRALI is defined as an acute lung injury that is temporally related to blood transfusion and \ncauses non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It occurs within the first six hours following a \ntransfusion. Screening for HLA antibodies has been introduced to prevent TRALI. TRALI usually results from the transfusion of donor plasma that contains high-titer anti-HLA \nclass II antibodies that bind to recipient leukocytes. The leukocytes aggregate in the pulmonary 36 \nSold by @itachibot vasculature and release mediators that increase capillary permeability.

      "explanation": "Sepsis is defined as a “life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to \ninfection.” It lies in the continuous spectrum between infection and septic shock. qSOFA score (quickSOFA) is a bedside prompt that may identify patients with suspected infection \nwho are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the intensive care unit (ICU). It uses three criteria, assigning one point each for • low blood pressure (SBP100 mmHg), • high respiratory rate ( 22 breaths per min) • altered mentation (Glasgow coma scale, &lt;15). 38 \nSold by @itachibot The score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points is a simple prompt \nto identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis. The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected \ninfection is by determining the Sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; \nwhich includes assessment of: • Circulation - Systolic BP &amp; need for vasopressors; platelet count • Respiration - PaO2/FiO2 &amp; need for mechanical ventilation • Mentation - Glasgow Coma Score • Hepatic function - Bilirubin • Renal function - Creatinine Organ dysfunction is identified by a SOFA score of  2 The SOFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex \nand time-consuming. In order to simplify the scoring process, the \"Sepsis - 3\" task force \nrecommended the quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment \"qSOFA\" score. SOFA Vs qSOFA : • SOFA is a more comprehensive and accurate scoring system which is particulary superior \nto qSOFA in the ICU setting. • qSOFA is a simplified derivative of SOFA for bedside assessment of individuals at risk for \nsepsis particularly useful outside the ICU. setting (i.e. ward / emergency department). However, \nnote that it was originally designed as predictive tool that calculates the risk of death from sepsis \nrather than a diagnostic tool. Thereby, the best description of sepsis based on \"Sepsis -3\" task force recommendations would be \n: • Suspected or documented infection with SOFA score  2 Or • Suspected or documented infection with qSOFA score  2 Another score that has been used is the NEWS(National Early Warning Score). It ranges from 0 to \n20 and is based on respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, use of supplemental O2, temperature, \nsystolic blood pressure, pulse rate and level of consciousness.  5 out of 20 is considered a positive \nscore. Other scoring systems for sepsis: The Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score is no longer recommended as is it \nnot specific to infection. The Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score is not recommended as it is complex and \nhas too many variables.",
