SMA syndrome, also called Wilkie's syndrome (option D), is characterized by an obstruction of the \nthird part of the duodenum by the SMA (option A) due to compression against fixed \nretroperitoneal structures. Symptoms include episodic epigastric pain associated with vomiting. Risk factors include rapid \nchildhood growth without compensatory weight gain, profound weight loss, abdominal surgery, \ninflammatory diseases of the abdomen, and immobilization in a cast that increases lordosis and \naccentuates the angle of the SMA with the aorta. Abdominal CT angiography is the investigation of choice. The CT image below shows narrowed \naortomesenteric angle in SMA syndrome: Lifestyle therapy includes frequent small feedings and patients may benefit from lying prone or on \ntheir left side postprandially. In some cases, weight gain or removal of a body cast improves symptoms. Laparoscopic lysis of \nthe ligament of Treitz is beneficial in few cases. The preferred surgical treatment is Strong's \nprocedure involving duodenojejunostomy (option C). 1202 \nSold by @itachibot 1203 \nSold by @itachibot Venous Diseases",
