        "a": "The spleen develops from the ventral mesogastrium",
        "b": "The axis of the spleen lies along the 9th rib",

        "d": "The spleen is partly covered by the peritoneum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The superior border of the spleen is notched. The superior border of the spleen separates the diaphragmatic surface from the gastric impression \nof the visceral surface. It often contains one or two notches. Additionally, there can be a notch on \nthe inferolateral border, and this may be palpated only when the spleen is enlarged. Option A: The spleen arises from the primitive mesoderm as an outgrowth of the left side of the \ndorsal mesogastrium. Option B: The spleen is related to the 9th, 10th, and 11th ribs, with its long axis along the 10th rib. Option D: The spleen is completely intraperitoneal. 788 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The phrenocolic ligament prevents the downward displacement of the spleen. The phrenicocolic ligament is not attached to the spleen. It attaches the splenic flexure of the \ncolon to the diaphragm. When the spleen gets enlarged, the phrenicocolic ligament along with the \nsplenic flexure of the colon restricts its downward displacement.The enlargement of the spleen \noccurs towards the right iliac fossa and is directed obliquely.

        "d": "Splenectomy is the best alternative treatment for this condition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The image showing petechiae and the given history of a child presenting with mucocutaneous \nbleed following an upper respiratory tract infection are highly suggestive of immune \nthrombocytopenic purpura. In idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the spleen is palpable in fewer than 10% \nof the patients, and the presence of gross splenic enlargement should raise the suspicion of an \nalternative diagnosis. Management of ITP: • In patients with platelet counts &lt;30,000/L, treatment may be instituted if there are \nsymptoms of life-threatening bleeding. • Prednisone at 1 mg/kg is the initial treatment of choice. • Rh(D) immune globulin is used only in Rh-positive patients. • Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). • Splenectomy is indicated in patients who have relapsed on glucocorticoid therapy. Relapse \npatients with intermittent or high platelet count can be managed with anti-Rh0(D) \nimmunoglobulin, IVIG, or with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. • Subcutaneous romiplostim and oral eltrombopag are thrombopoietin receptor agonists used in \nadults who are at risk of bleeding even after splenectomy. Option A: The acute form is more commonly seen in children following a viral infection, while the \nchronic form is more often seen in adult women of childbearing years. Option C: The bone marrow examination can be normal or show an increased number of \nmegathrombocytes. Option D: 80% of cases undergo spontaneous remission in children. Patients who do not respond \nto first-line therapy like steroids and IVIG are best treated by splenectomy. 791 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Thrombocytosis occurs following splenectomy. This occurs particularly in patients with myeloproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic myeloid \nleukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis). It may result in thrombosis of the \nmesenteric, portal, and renal veins which can be life-threatening as it can lead to haemorrhage \nand thromboembolism. Option A: Tropical splenomegaly is massive splenic enlargement, which frequently occurs in the \ntropics due to malaria, kala-azar, and schistosomiasis. Option C: Autosplenectomy is seen in sickle cell anemia. Splenomegaly is seen in thalassemia and \nhereditary spherocytosis. Option D: Howell-Jolly bodies are the nuclear remnants present in the RBCs. They appear as \ndense blue colored circular inclusions as shown in the image below.
