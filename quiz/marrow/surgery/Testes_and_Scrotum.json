      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most common site of ectopic testes is the superficial inguinal pouch. Testes develop from the genital ridge in the retroperitoneum at 3 months of intrauterine life. They \ndescend into the scrotum by 9 months of age due to differential abdominal growth, pull of the \ngubernaculum, and the effect of testosterone. Cryptorchidism refers to the absence of one or both testes in the scrotal sac. The descent of the \ntestis can be arrested in its usual path of descent (true undescended testis) or can migrate from \nthe usual path of descent (ectopic testis). The image below shows the possible sites of the testes in cryptorchidism: A retractile testis can also lie in the inguinal canal and needs to be differentiated between an \nectopic testes. It is present in the scrotum and occasionally moves into the inguinal canal. 990 \nSold by @itachibot An ectopic testis is treated with orchidopexy, while a retractile testis requires no intervention as it \nresolves spontaneously.",

      "explanation": "The tumor most likely to develop in this patient is seminoma. The tumor that develops most commonly in undesceded testes is germ cell tumor in situ or \nintratubular germ cell tumor. It commonly progresses into seminomas. In patients with a nonpalpable testicle, diagnostic laparoscopy is performed. If testis is still not \nvisualised, the spermatic cord or testicular artery is traced at the deep inguinal ring to locate it. If a blind ending spermatic cord is found instead, vanishing testis syndrome (or testicular \nregression syndrome) is suspected. It is the partial or total absence of testicular tissue often due to \nan ischemic event in foetal life. 991 \nSold by @itachibot The testis once found can be delivered into the scrotum, and an orchidopexy is performed.",

      "explanation": "In the first stage of a two-stage Stephens-Fowler approach, the testicular vessels are clipped. Clipping of the testicular artery promotes neo vasculogenesis along the vas deferens. It does not \nresult in ischemia of the testis due to the presence of collaterals from the cremasteric artery and \nthe artery to the ductus deferens (deferential artery). Several months later, after collaterals are established, the second stage is performed during which \nthe testis and its new blood supply is mobilized into the scrotum. Stephen-Fowler’s approach is done when an intra abdominal testes is located too far to reach the \nscrotum. Alternatively, Silbar’s orchiopexy may be done. In this procedure, microvascular \nanastomosis of the testicular vessels with internal illiac vessels is done after the testis is mobilised \nto the scrotum.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "High investment of the tunica vaginalis is the most common cause of torsion of testis. It causes \nthe testes to hang within the tunica like a clapper in a bell. This is the most common cause of \ntesticular torsion in adolescents. Bell clapper testes are typically bilateral. The image below shows the bell-clapper deformity of the \ntestes: 992 \nSold by @itachibot Other abnormalities that cause torsion of the testes: • Inversion of the testis: The testis is rotated so that it lies transversely or upside down. • Pedicle between epididymis and body of testis: Separation of the epididymis from the body of the \ntestis by a pedicle allows torsion of the testis on the pedicle that connects the testis with the \nepididymis. An appendix testis is a small vestigial appendage located on the upper pole of the testis. Twisting \nof the appendage causes testicular appendix torsion. In it, a classic blue dot sign is seen on the \nupper pole of the testis. It is seen as a hard tender nodule with a blue discoloration on the \nsuperior aspect of the testis.

Clinical features of testicular torsion are painful scrotal swelling, erythema, nausea, and vomiting, \ntestis seems high in the scrotum and the twisted cord can sometimes be palpated. Signs seen on torsion of the testis are: • Deming’s sign: Spasm of the cremaster muscle due to twisting of the spermatic cord causes the \naffected testis to be positioned higher than the normal testis. • Angell’s sign: The testis on the normal side lies horizontally because of the mesorchium between \nthe testis and epididymis. • Cremastic reflex: Absent on the side of the affected testis Doppler ultrasound scanning can confirm the absence of the blood supply to the affected testis, \nbut the false positives are high and hence it is not routinely recommended. Manual detorsion of the testes is usually difficult because of acute pain during manipulation. \nNonoperative manual detorsion is not a substitute for surgical exploration.",

      "explanation": "In a case of suspected testicular torsion, immediate exploration needs to be done on both the \nsymptomatic as well as the asymptomatic side. After the de-torsion, the adequacy of the blood \nflow has to be assessed by Doppler. In testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised due to the twisting of the \nspermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis, resulting in ischemia of the epididymis and the testis. \nThe patient usually presents with acute onset pain and swelling of the scrotum. On examination, \nthe cremasteric reflex is lost, and the scrotum looks asymmetrical. Prehn’s sign is used to differentiate epididymitis from testicular torsion. Prehn’s sign is said to be \npositive when the pain gets relieved on lifting the testis, and it is seen in epididymo-orchitis. At the time of surgical exploration, contralateral testes also must be explored and fixed to the \ndartos fascia in order to prevent possible torsion occurring in this testes. More than 80% of the testis can be salvaged if surgery is performed within 6 hours. If the testis is \nfound to be necrosed on scrotal exploration, orchidectomy of the necrosed testis and orchidopexy \nof the contralateral testis is done.",

A Prehn’s sign is \nsaid to be positive when the pain gets relieved on lifting the testis. If it persists, it is likely to be \ntesticular torsion. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of acute epididymitis in young, sexually active \nmales.

The next best step is confirmation \nwith polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Beading of the vas deferens is due to subepithelial tubercle formation and is specific to genital \ntuberculosis. A scrotal USG will reveal an enlarged epididymis but does not have diagnostic value. Chest, \nkidney, and upper urinary tract imaging may reveal a primary focus. Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis is usually secondary and resolves once the primary focus is \ntreated. Hence, a course of anti-tubercular therapy must be completed even if there is no evidence \nof disease elsewhere.

More \nundifferentiated lesions may display sheets of cells with cleft-like spaces. The neoplastic cells have \nan epithelial appearance, are large and anaplastic, and have hyperchromatic nuclei with \nprominent nucleoli. The cell borders are usually indistinct, and there is considerable variation in \ncell and nuclear size and shape (pleomorphism). Mitotic figures and tumor giant cells are \nfrequently seen. 999 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Teratomas also have a variegated appearance but have cysts reflecting the multiplicity \nof tissue types. Histologically, collections of differentiated cells or organoid structures originating \nin all 3 germ layers can be seen. Elements may be mature (resembling various adult tissues) or \nimmature (sharing histologic features with fetal or embryonic tissue).",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "There is no role of testicular biopsy in the diagnosis of testicular tumors. This is due to the risk of \nseeding tumor cells onto the scrotal wall. In testicular tumors, the most common site of lymphatic spread is retroperitoneal lymph nodes \nwhich may present as an abdominal lump. Elevated tumor markers are found almost exclusively in non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors. \nFew seminomas may have elevated placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) or beta-human \nchorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be used as a marker of tumor \nbulk. Seminomas are radiosensitive tumors that metastasize via lymphatics. Non-germ-cell tumors arise \nfrom Sertoli or Leydig cells and follow a more benign course. Approximately only 10% are \nmalignant.",
