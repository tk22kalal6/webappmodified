Parts of the adrenal glands: • The adrenal cortex is arranged in a zonal configuration in three zones - • Outer zona glomerulosa- secretes mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) • Middle zona fasciculata- secretes glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) • Inner zona reticularis- secretes androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone) • The adrenal medulla- stores and secretes catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) 355 \nSold by @itachibot On histological examination, the different layers are identified as: • Outer zona glomerulosa - small, compact cells • Central zona fasciculata - larger lipid-rich cells arranged in radial columns • Inner zona reticularis - pigmented, compact cells • Adrenal medulla - thin layer of large chromaffin cells Option A: Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine producing tumour derived from chromaffin cells \nand arises from the adrenal medulla. Option C: In Conn’s syndrome, excess aldosterone is secreted from zona glomerulosa. Option D: Neuroblastoma arises from the adrenal medulla. 356 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The only indication for an adrenal gland biopsy is to confirm adrenal gland metastasis. An adrenal incidentaloma is defined as a clinically unapparent adrenal lesion that is incidentally \ndetected on imaging performed for indications other than evaluation for adrenal disease. The \nmajority of these lesions are non-functional tumours i.e. benign. The likelihood of an adrenal \nmass being an adrenocortical carcinoma increases with the size of the mass (25% chance if size \n&gt;4 cm). Incidentalomas are evaluated to classify them as functional and non-functional. Non-functional \nincidentalomas &lt;4cm are managed conservatively with MRI surveillance every 3-6 months. If \n&gt;4cm, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done. Note: An adrenal mass should never be biopsied until a pheochromocytoma has been \nbiochemically excluded.",

      "explanation": "During selective adrenal vein sampling, a significant difference in the aldosterone-cortisol ratio on \none side indicates unilateral hyperaldosteronism. In this case, unilateral laparoscopic \nadrenalectomy is the treatment of choice. Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) is characterized by hypersecretion of aldosterone with \nsuppressed plasma renin levels (due to the negative feedback). The most frequent cause of PHA is \nunilateral adenoma. CT or MRI is used to detect the tumour. In a patient with bilateral micronodular hyperplasia, \nthere could be a unilateral non-functioning tumour. Selective adrenal vein sampling can be done \nto differentiate between unilateral and bilateral disease. Conservative management with 3-6 months of MRI surveillance is done in non-functional adrenal \ntumours of &lt; 4cm. Medical management is done in patients with bilateral disease, the commonly implemented \ntherapeutic approach is treatment with spironolactone and antihypertensive medication. Surgical management is done in unilateral and asymmetrical bilateral disease by unilateral \nlaparoscopic adrenalectomy. A subtotal resection can be considered in the case of a typical single \nConn’s adenoma. However, it is not superior to unilateral adrenalectomy.",

Since the MRI pituitary is inconclusive, \nthe next best step is to perform a venous sampling from the inferior petrosal sinus.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "359 \nSold by @itachibot The rationale behind cortisol supplementation after the surgical removal of the adenoma is that \nthere is suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland by the pre-operative elevated cortisol \nlevels. This causes primary adrenal insufficiency. Patients undergoing unilateral adrenalectomy typically require exogenous steroids for up to a \nyear, which is usually the duration the remaining adrenal gland takes to recover adequate \nfunction. In bilateral adrenalectomy, steroids are required indefinitely, and patients may also \nrequire mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Option A: The remaining adrenal gland usually has sufficient reserve to maintain homeostasis. Option C: A deficiency of ACTH causes secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the adrenal \ninsufficiency post adrenalectomy is primary i.e due to the hyposecretion of cortisol from the gland \nitself. Option D: Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome is a bilateral adrenal infarction associated with \nmeningococcal sepsis and is rapidly fatal unless immediately treated.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of new-onset hyperpigmentation post-adrenalectomy is suggestive \nof Nelson’s syndrome. The first-line and definitive management is surgical resection of the \npituitary adenoma. Nelson’s syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is a \nprocedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary \nadenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases \nCRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the \noriginal pituitary tumor or formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: • Hyperpigmentation • Excessive ACTH secretion • Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regular \nintervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The \nprimary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid \nreplacement, as they do not produce cortisol. The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the need \nfor bilateral adrenalectomy these days.",

      "explanation": "In this scenario, the elevated urinary metanephrines point towards the diagnosis of \npheochromocytoma. Hence, the next best step is an MRI to localise the site of the tumour. MRI is preferred for the localization of pathologies because contrast media used for CT scans can \nprovoke paroxysms. Classically, pheochromocytomas show a ‘Swiss cheese’ configuration. 123 Iodine-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) single-photon emission computed tomography \n(SPECT) is essential for the detection of multiple extra-adrenal tumours and metastases, but PET \nscan using FDG or DOPA is more sensitive in detecting metastatic foci.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of hypotension with no presence of bleeding and bilateral \nadrenalectomy is suggestive of an Addisonian crisis. It is a life-threatening condition caused due \nto sudden insufficiency of adrenal hormones. Acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal or addisonian's crisis) is a medical emergency caused due to a \nprecipitating illness unmasking insufficiency or trauma or severe sepsis causing adrenal \nhemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) or surgical removal of the glands. It presents \nwith non-specific symptoms such as shock with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \nhypocalcemia and electrolyte imbalances. It may be often misdiagnosed as an acute abdominal \nemergency. Adrenal insufficiency can be primary (due to adrenal pathology), secondary (due to pituitary \npathology- lack of ACTH) or tertiary (due to hypothalamus pathology- lack of CRH). Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency worldwide. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in India. Adrenal crisis requires immediate intervention owing to its high mortality rate. Immediate \nrehydration is initiated with a saline infusion at 1 litre/hr with continuous cardiac monitoring. \nGlucocorticoid replacement is initiated with an initial bolus injection of hydrocortisone 100 mg \nfollowed by 200 mg over 24 hours, preferably by continuous infusion or alternatively by IV or IM \ninjections. Mineralocorticoid replacement is initiated once the daily dose of hydrocortisone has \nbeen reduced to &lt;50 mg, since hydrocortisone at higher doses provides sufficient stimulation of \nmineralocorticoids.",
