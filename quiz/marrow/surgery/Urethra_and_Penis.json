      "explanation": "The most common site of urethral stricture is the bulbar urethra. A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra caused by scarring, which functionally causes \nobstructive voiding dysfunction of the lower urinary tract. The most common cause of urethral stricture is trauma. It can also be iatrogenic due urethral \ncatheterization and infections. These patients present with features of the hesitancy of micturition, straining to void, and poor \nurinary stream. The most common complication of urethral stricture is urinary tract infection.",

The management of a urethral stricture depends on the site, the length, and the cause of the \nstricture.

It is considered when a stricture is due to \ntrauma or recurred following endoscopic treatment. • Urethral dilation - The urethra is stretched using urethral dilators. This is a blind procedure and \nit can cause injury. Hence, it is not done frequently. • Intermittent self-dilatation - In patients with recurrent strictures who are unable to undergo \nurethroplasty, then intermittent self-dilatation with soft hydrophilic catheters is done on a daily \nbasis.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with the USG showing the key-hole sign is suggestive of the posterior \nurethral valve (PUV). It is seen due to dilatation of the bladder and the proximal urethra. The posterior urethral valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit, which lies just distal \nto the verumontanum. They function as flap valves and are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow. The posterior urethral valve is the most common congenital cause of bladder outlet obstruction in \nmales. PUV is classified into three types based on Young's classification. Diagnosis is made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis \nabove a distended bladder. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then neonates typically \npresent with urinary infection or uremia and renal failure. The investigation of choice for a posterior urethral valve is micturating cystourethrography \n(MCUG). Initially, the obstruction is relieved by catheterization to preserve renal function. Definitive \ntreatment is by urethroscopic destruction of the valves with lifelong supportive treatment.

Circumcision should not be done in hypospadias as the foreskin will \nbe used for surgical reconstruction. Hypospadias is the most common congenital abnormality of the urethra. It is characterized by the \ncombination of: • A ventrally placed urethral meatus (underside of penis or perineum) • Poor development of the ventral aspect of the prepuce (resulting in hooded foreskin) • Ventral chordee (bending of the penis) 971 \nSold by @itachibot Hypospadias does not cause either obstruction or urinary tract infection and surgery is \nrecommended for sexual, urinary stream, or cosmetic reasons.

If \nmanual reduction of the skin is unsuccessful, a dorsal slit procedure should be performed. Paraphimosis is the inability to place back the retracted preputial skin.

The first line of treatment includes manual reduction of the skin by applying lignocaine jelly.

      "explanation": "Penile deformity, painful erection, and palpable penile plaques are features associated with \nPeyronie's disease. Nesbitt’s procedure is the most common procedure done for this condition. Peyronie's disease is caused due to injury to tunica albuginea resulting in microhemorrhages. This \nleads to excess collagen deposition, calcification, and penile plaques. Hence, the penis \nbends towards the side of the plaque. This causes difficulty during sexual intercourse. It is also \nassociated with Dupuytren's contracture. 976 \nSold by @itachibot Nesbitt's procedure corrects the deformity by plicating the opposite side of the deformity, thereby \nstraightening the penis. This procedure is done once the active phase subsides as the bend \nincreases during the active phase (18-24 months). Option B: Downward directed stream of urine with bending of the penis are symptoms of \nhypospadias. Option C: Persistent erection lasting longer than 4 hours is called priapism.

The Heineke-Mikulicz principle involves the use of a longitudinal incision followed by a \ntransverse closure, or vice-versa. In preputioplasty, it allows for the retraction of the foreskin, and \nin frenuloplasty, it allows the lengthening of the frenulum. Heineke-Mikulicz's pyloroplasty also uses the same principle.
