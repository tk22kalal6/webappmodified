      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute bacterial prostatitis and should be managed by \nantibiotics. A rigorous and prolonged treatment for 2-6 weeks with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate \nwall is indicated (trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin or aminoglycoside). Incomplete infection \neradication lead to recurrent attacks and chronic prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis is usually caused by an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) or reflux \nof infected urine into prostatic ducts. The most common organism is Escherichia coli. An \nassociated increase in levels of PSA(&gt;4ng/ml) may be present due to prostate inflammation. Catheterization and prostatic massage are contraindicated in patients with suspected acute \nprostatitis, as they increase the chance for bacteremia and sepsis. Instead, suprapubic tap should \nbe performed to alleviate retention. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. Diagnosis includes: • Three-glass urine test - If the first glass with the initial urine sample is clear, but the second and \nthird samples contain prostatic threads and leukocytes, it indicates the presence of prostatitis. • Digital rectal examination - Prostate may be normal, boggy, or tender. • Prostatic fluid examination - post-prostatic massage fluid shows pus cells and bacteria.",

      "explanation": "The most common organism causing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) is Escherichia coli. It is commonly caused by an ascending urethral infection or reflux of infected urine into prostatic \nducts. Sexually transmissible infections and other urinary pathogens, such as Staphylococcus \naureus and Streptococcus faecalis may also be responsible. The patient presents with fever, perineal pain, chills and rigor, and dysuria. Per rectal \nexamination will reveal a tender, boggy prostate. Care should be taken to avoid aggressive \npalpation or prostatic massage as it can lead to bacterial dissemination and sepsis. Urine examination and culture should be done. Urine examination reveals threads in urine. Management: Patients with systemic signs of infection should be admitted for IV antibiotics, hydration, and \nmonitoring of laboratory parameters. Patients who have no signs of systemic infection, who can tolerate oral intake, and who have no \nurinary retention can be treated with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics are given for 2-6 weeks to ensure 949 \nSold by @itachibot the eradication of the infection as antibiotics don't penetrate the prostate capsule easily. ‘or outpatient therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg oral every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg OD or \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet oral every 12 hours can be used. ‘or hospitalized patients: Intravenous ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin with or without an \naminoglycoside (gentamicin or tobramycin) or intravenous beta-lactam with or without an \naminoglycoside.

The surgical site is irrigated with a non-conducting non-ionic fluid as the use of an \nionic solution leads to dissipation of the cutting current and poor cutting efficacy. Thus, normal \nsaline and N/5 saline cannot be used. The use of distilled water in TURP leads to the water-intoxication syndrome. Bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (B-TURP) uses a specialized resecting loop that \nincorporates both the active and the return portions of the circuit on the same electrode and an \nionic irrigating solution such as normal saline can be used safely.",

      "explanation": "Blastic lesions on X-Ray after surgical castration (therapeutic orchidectomy) in patients with \nprostatic carcinoma is suggestive of hormone-resistant bone metastasis. The treatment of choice \nfor hormone-resistant bone metastasis is radiopharmaceutical therapy with radium-223. Radium-223 is a radioactive isotope that emits low levels of alpha-particle radiation. The \nalpha-particle radiation causes double-strand breaks in DNA, which kills cells. Radium-223 is a \n“calcium mimetic” that accumulates preferentially in areas of bone undergoing increased turnover, \nsuch as areas of bone metastases. 958 \nSold by @itachibot Management of Prostatic Car \ncinoma Stage of cancer \nAge>70 or Gleason score=6 \nAge<70 or Gleason score>6 Active surveillance \nRadical prostatectomy Early prostate cancer: T1, T2 \nA Brachytherapy + Androgen d \neprivation therapy Brachytherapy + Radical pros \ntatectomy ˜ocally advanced prostate ca \nncer: T2B, T2C, T3, T4, N1 Metastatic prostate cancer \nAndrogen deprivation therap \nyChemotherapy and radiothe \nrapy (hormone-resistant tum \nor)Radiopharmaceutical ther \napy (hormone-resistant bony \nmetastasis)",
