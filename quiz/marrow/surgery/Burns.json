If the trauma \nis the greater immediate risk, the patient may be stabilized in a trauma center before transfer to a \nburn center. • Burned children in hospitals without qualified personnel for the care of children. • Burn injury in patients who will require special social, emotional, or rehabilitative intervention.",

      "explanation": "Following irrigation of the burn site, topical application of calcium gluconate gel along with ECG \nmonitoring is the most appropriate management. 1072 \nSold by @itachibot Hydrofluoric acid is the strongest inorganic acid and it can cause liquefaction necrosis of deeper \ntissues (since the acid is highly lipophilic). Pain out of proportion to physical examination is a \nhallmark finding in HF burns. Systemic absorption of fluoride ions can result in intravascular \nchelation of calcium causing hypocalcemia. Depletion of calcium causes inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to \nhyperkalemia and subsequent life-threatening arrhythmias. Therefore ECG monitoring is \nimperative. ECG abnormalities that can occur include prolonged QTc (from hypocalcemia) \nand QRS widening (from hyperkalemia). Following copious irrigation of the burn site with water, the mainstay of treatment is with topical \napplication of calcium gluconate gel. If the pain does not subside, or if systemic signs ensue, an \nintraarterial injection of calcium gluconate can be given in the affected extremity.",

Crystalloids are said to be as effective as colloids for maintaining intravascular volume and are \ngiven during the initial 24 hours. Option A: Normal saline may be used, but large quantities of saline can cause hyperchloremic \nmetabolic acidosis, worsening this patient's existing acidosis.

        "d": "Elective endotracheal intubation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "For a patient who presents with a history or suspicion of inhalational burn injury, elective \nendotracheal intubation is the safest strategy. Delay can make intubation very difficult because of airway edema and can lead to airway \nobstruction. One should be ready to perform an emergency cricothyroidotomy if intubation is \ndelayed. Recognition of the potentially burned airway: • A history of being trapped in the presence of smoke or hot gases • Burns on the palate or nasal mucosa, or loss of all the hairs in the nose • Deep burns around the mouth and neck American Burn Life Support (ABLS) indications for early intubation include: • Signs of airway obstruction (hoarseness, stridor, accessory respiratory muscle use, sternal \nretraction) • The extent of the burn (TBSA &gt; 40%–50%) • Extensive and deep facial burns • Burns inside the mouth or difficulty swallowing • Significant edema or risk for edema • Signs of respiratory compromise: Inability to clear secretions, respiratory fatigue, poor \noxygenation or ventilation • Decreased level of consciousness where airway protective reflexes are impaired • Anticipated patient transfer of large burn with airway issue without qualified personnel to \nintubate en route",

      "explanation": "1078 \nSold by @itachibot Scald injury (damage from contact with hot liquids) that appears pink in colour, has oozing, and \npain is suggestive of a 2nd-degree burn (i.e. partial-thickness burn). Collagen dressing is the most \nappropriate management for this injury. The best dressing for burn wounds is skin; collagen is a good substitute for skin, especially in \npartial-thickness burns. For full-thickness burns, sequential excision and grafting should be \nconsidered. Initial treatment for burns includes cleaning burnt areas and removing loose dead skin. Blisters \nare de-roofed and an appropriate dressing is applied. Biological dressing (collagen dressings, amniotic membrane, etc.) is the preferred dressing \nmaterial, especially in partial thickness burns. If this is not available then a non-adhesive dressing like paraffin gauze impregnated with silver \nsulfadiazine (SSD) cream, colloidal silver, ionic silver cream, or silver nitrate cream can be \napplied. Since increased resistance to SSD has recently emerged, it should be judiciously used and \nreserved for deep dermal, full thickness, infected, and old neglected burns.",

Heat Cramps: • These are painful spasms of voluntary muscles which follow strenuous work in a hot \natmosphere. • Caused by loss of water and salt in profuse sweating.
