      "explanation": "Explanation: The most common presentation of an abdominal desmoid tumor is an abdominal mass. 578 \nSold by @itachibot Desmoid tumors, also known as fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type \nfibromatosis are locally aggressive tumors that lack metastatic potential. Desmoid tumors can be \nsporadic in origin or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. These tumors arise from fibro-aponeurotic tissue and typically are manifested as a slowly growing \nmass. They present as firm, non-painful, non-tender masses in the abdominal wall, shoulder, hip \nand limbs, mesentery, and pelvis. They are also associated with trauma, pregnancy, and oral \ncontraceptive usage. The investigation of choice for a desmoid tumor is MRI. It is superior to CT in defining the \npattern and the extent of involvement and can determine recurrence after surgery. Diagnosis is \nestablished by a biopsy with immunohistochemistry, which stains positive for beta-catenin, actin \nand vimentin, and negative for desmin, cytokeratin and S-100. Treatment: • An initial observation is preferred for stable, asymptomatic, primary or recurrent desmoids, \nespecially if surgery can cause high mortality. • Surgical resection with negative margin clearance is reserved for patients with small abdominal \nwall tumors associated with pain or an increase in size. • Tamoxifen and NSAIDs are used as first-line medical therapy. Other systemic treatment options \nare low-dose chemotherapy, tyrosinase kinase inhibitors, and full-dose chemotherapy • Radiotherapy is preferred for candidates unfit for surgery, patients refusing surgery and when \nsurgical resection is associated with high morbidity.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the patient has numerous adenomatous polyps and a tumor in the \nbrain. Therefore the most likely diagnosis is Turcot's syndrome. It is a variant of familial \nadenomatous polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant condition and is caused due to \nthe mutation in the APC gene located on chromosome 5. Clinically, patients develop hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and \nrectum. Some patients may also develop duodenal adenomas. The lifetime risk of developing \ncolorectal carcinoma in these patients is 100%. The treatment of the FAP includes total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis \n(IPAA). Variants of FAP are: • Gardner's syndrome- It is an autosomal dominant variant of FAP. In addition to colonic polyps \nthe patients will have • Osteomas of the mandible or skull • Epidermal cysts • Soft tissue tumors like desmoid tumor 579 \nSold by @itachibot • Turcot's syndrome- In addition to the colonic polyps the patients will have central nervous \nsystem tumors (primary brain tumors).
