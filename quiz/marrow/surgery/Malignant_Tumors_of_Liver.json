Localized hepatocellular carcinoma • Child-Pugh class A: Patients with child-pugh class A should undergo resection of the tumor. • Those with low FLR (&lt;30%) should ideally be treated by preoperative portal vein embolization \nfollowed by resection. Preoperative embolization helps in improving the FLR volume function \nprior to resection. • Those with adequate FLR (&gt;30-40%) can usually tolerate resection alone. • Child-Pugh class B/C or portal hypertension: Patients with early-stage HCC and child-Pugh class \nB/C or portal hypertension should be considered for transplantation. Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are treated with palliative intent. Following are \nthe management options: • Drug therapy - Sorafenib/ Sunitinib/ Regorafenib • Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and transarterial radioembolisation (TARE) offer the \nbest results in multifocal disease • Radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, high-frequency ultrasound therapy are alternative \noptions • Patients with extreme deterioration of performance status and liver function should be offered \nsupportive treatment only.",

      "explanation": "730 \nSold by @itachibot Auxiliary orthotopic liver transplantation (A-OLTX) is indicated in non-cirrhotic metabolic liver \ndisease. Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation is a technique where part of the diseased native \nliver is removed and replaced with a part of the healthy donor liver. This is done so the retained \nnative liver can regenerate. In selective cases of acute liver failure, auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation could \nprovide a chance for native liver regeneration and immunosuppression-free life. Auxillary orthotopic liver transplant is indicated for the following: • Patients aged &lt;40 years • Reversible fulminant hepatic failure (auxiliary liver transplantation cannot be done in cases of \nirreversible liver failure) • Non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease • No hemodynamic instability • Hyperacute (not in other cases) Liver failure with Acetaminophen overdose.
