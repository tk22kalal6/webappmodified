      "explanation": "120 \nSold by @itachibot Atropine does not cause increased bowel sounds. It decreases the amplitude and frequency of \nperistalsis, resulting in decreased bowel sounds. Peristalsis suppression due to atropine is incomplete because of the additional control of \nperistalsis by local reflexes in the enteric nervous system and involvement of other \nneurotransmitters like 5-HT, encephalin, dopamine in peristalsis. Actions of atropine: • Mydriasis - by blocking the contraction of sphincter pupillae muscle • Decreased secretions from salivary glands and lacrimal glands - by blocking M1 &amp; M3 \nreceptors • Tachycardia - due to its vagolytic activity at M2 receptor • Decreased sweating - by inhibiting sympathetic cholinergic supply to sweat glands which makes \nthe skin hot and dry (atropine fever).",

      "explanation": "Atropine at average clinical doses of 0.4-0.6 mg administered parenterally results in transient \nbradycardia followed by tachycardia. Parasympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals in the SA node contain presynaptic M1 receptors. \nThese receptors normally inhibit the release of ACh. Therefore stimulation of these receptors \ndecreases the release of ACh causing tachycardia. Inhibition of these receptors increases ACh \ncausing bradycardia. Atropine initially blocks these presynaptic M1 receptors. This increases the amount of ACh \nreleased at the SA node and causes bradycardia. Then, the progressive increase in the atropine \nconcentration blocks the postsynaptic M2 receptors on the SA node (decreasing the ACh release) \ndecreasing the parasympathetic tone, thereby causing tachycardia.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Mydriatic action of a muscarinic antagonist is due to the paralysis of the sphincter \npupillae (circular) muscle of the iris. In the iris, miosis occurs due to the constriction of the pupillary sphincter muscles and mydriasis \nis due to the contraction of the dilator pupillae (radial) muscles. They counter-balance each other. When muscarinic antagonists are instilled, the pupillary sphincter muscle is paralyzed, causing \nmydriasis due to the unopposed contraction of the dilator pupillae muscle.

      "explanation": "Atropine is substituted by phenylephrine in situations where mydriasis is required without \ncycloplegia, like in fundoscopy. Phenylephrine, an alpha 1 agonist, acts on the radial muscle (dilator pupillae) of the iris and \ncauses isolated mydriasis. It has no cycloplegic action because sympathetic receptors are present \nonly on the iris and not on the ciliary body. 124 \nSold by @itachibot Atropine has both mydriatic and cycloplegic action, which is required for refraction testing. In elderly people who have a low ciliary tone, phenylephrine is preferred as a mydriatic. This is \nbecause other anticholinergics can precipitate or aggravate glaucoma by relaxation of the ciliary \nbody and altering the forces acting on trabecular meshwork for aqueous outflow. Atropine, cyclopentolate, and tropicamide are antimuscarinics that are available for ophthalmic \nuse and cause cycloplegia to a variable extent. This cycloplegia/paralysis of accommodation occurs \ndue to their parasympatholytic action, which decreases the tone of the ciliary body.",

      "explanation": "Tiotropium has a selective action on M1 and M3 receptors. Tiotropium binds to all M1, M2 and M3 receptors. However, it dissociates slower from M1 and M3 \nreceptors as compared to M2. This shows it has a higher affinity towards M1 and M3 receptors. Ipratropium and atropine methonitrate do not have any subtype selectivity on muscarinic \nreceptors. Inhibition of mucociliary clearance by atropine results in the accumulation of lower airway \nsecretions and the formation of mucus plugs. However, tiotropium and ipratropium have \nminimum interference with mucociliary clearance when compared to atropine, and the incidence 127 \nSold by @itachibot of mucus plugs is also less.",

Muscarinic antagonists are contraindicated in urinary tract obstruction and in benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (or used with extreme caution). Bronchial asthma, hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease are not the contraindications for the use \nof trospium.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Glycopyrrolate usually does not produce central anticholinergic syndrome. It is a quaternary \namine compound and lipid insoluble. Therefore, glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain \nbarrier. Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants are used in anesthesia. Neostigmine along with \nglycopyrrolate are used for reversal of this neuromuscular block. Glycopyrrolate blocks the \nperipheral muscarinic side effects due to the increased acetylcholine levels after the \nadministration of neostigmine, without causing unwanted central anticholinergic effects. Peripheral and central anticholinergic syndromes are reactions due to either overdose or any \nunusual reaction to the usage of drugs like atropine and other muscarinic agents, phenothiazines, \nantihistamines, and tricyclic antidepressants Option B: Atropine is a tertiary compound that can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause central \nanticholinergic syndrome. Option C and D: Some of the first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants have \nsignificant anticholinergic activity and can cause central anticholinergic syndrome.",

Scopolamine hydrochloride was also used in narcoanalysis during World War II. It was popularly \nknown as the 'lie detector'. The amnesic and depressant actions of scopolamine are due to the \ninhibition of the brain cholinergic system. It would put the subject off guard in case of sustained \ninterrogation and sleep deprivation, eventually forcing the truth out. 128 \nSold by @itachibot",
