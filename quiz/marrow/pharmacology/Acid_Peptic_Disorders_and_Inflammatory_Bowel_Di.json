      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The final step in gastric acid production is inhibited by the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The secretion of protons by the activated H+/K+- ATPase (proton pump) in the parietal cells into \nthe gastric lumen is the final step involved in the production of gastric acid. PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid and also reduces basal acid secretion. \nSuppression of gastric acid occurs regardless of the stimulus present.",

      "explanation": "812 \nSold by @itachibot PPIs irreversibly inhibit the proton pump molecule and hence, acid secretion requires the \nsynthesis of new proton pumps. PPIs are prodrugs, when ingested, get absorbed into the systemic circulation. It then diffuses into \nthe parietal cells of the stomach and accumulates in the acidic secretory canaliculi. Acidic pH in \nthe parietal cell canaliculi causes activation of the PPIs. These activated PPIs irreversibly inhibit \nH+/K+ ATPase (proton pump) in the parietal cell. The maximum proton pump activation corresponds to the peak concentration of PPI resulting in \nmaximum efficacy. The secretion resumes gradually over 3-4 days of stopping the drug when new proton pumps are \nsynthesized.",

All PPIs are metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochromes, including CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and may \ninterfere with the metabolism of the other drugs. It inhibits the metabolism of clopidogrel, \ndiazepam, and phenytoin. Note: There is disagreement among different authors regarding the PPIs and their interactions \nwith the metabolism of other drugs. • Goodman and Gilman mention that lansoprazole and rabeprazole along with omeprazole and \nesomeprazole interact with the metabolism of warfarin. • Katzung and various online sources agree that lansoprazole and rabeprazole do not or minimally \ninteract with warfarin metabolism. • All of them agree that pantoprazole does not or minimally interacts with warfarin metabolism.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Ranitidine increases the gastric pH (i.e. less acidic) which reduces sucralfate efficacy; hence the \ncombination is incorrect. Polymerization of sucralfate occurs only at an acidic pH by crosslinking of the molecules which \nforms a sticky gel-like consistency. This adheres to the ulcer base predominantly and remains \nthere for almost 6 hours, preventing the ulcer base from coming in contact with the acid. Concurrent use of H2 blockers like ranitidine increases the gastric pH and thus hinders the \npolymerization and reduces the efficacy of sucralfate. Sucralfate should be taken at least 2 hours after the administration of any other drug.",
