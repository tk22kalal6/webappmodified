      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "C-peptide can be used to rule out the possibility of factitious hypoglycemia resulting \nfrom exogenously administered insulin. Endogenous insulin is initially synthesized as preproinsulin that is processed to proinsulin inside \nbeta cells. Proinsulin is released by secretory granules after processing it to form insulin and \nC-peptide. Synthetic insulin usually lacks C-peptide, so in factitious hypoglycemia secondary to exogenous \ninsulin administration, plasma insulin will be elevated, but there will be suppression of C-peptide \nand proinsulin, and insulin to C-peptide ratio will be greater than one. On the other hand, insulinomas and insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas stimulate \nendogenous insulin production. As a result, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels will \nbe all elevated. The only way to differentiate between insulinoma and insulin \nsecretagogues-induced hypoglycemia is by detecting the drug, e.g., sulfonylurea, in the blood or \nurine. 665 \nSold by @itachibot C-peptide has no known physiological function or receptor. It has a half-life of about 30 min.",

Insulin therapy alone in a patient with \ndiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may result in hypokalemia. DKA is usually associated with a major K+ deficit. Potassium loss is caused by an extracellular \nshift of potassium (in exchange with hydrogen ions) due to acidosis. Much of the shifted \nextracellular potassium is lost due to emesis and osmotic diuresis. When insulin therapy is initiated for DKA, the serum K+ is shifted intracellularly. Dangerous \nhypokalemia might occur if K+ supplementation is not initiated subsequently. Insulin should be \nwithheld if the serum level of potassium is below 3.3 mmol/L.",

Options A, C, and D: Regular insulin and short-acting insulins (glulisine and aspart) can be given \nintravenously. While short-acting insulins are approved for intravenous administration under \nsupervision, regular insulin is preferred in perioperative glycemic control due to the lesser risk of \nhypoglycemia.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Insulin glargine forms a cloudy white precipitate when mixed with short-acting insulins. Due to the acidic pH (4.0) of insulin glargine, it cannot be mixed with short-acting insulin \npreparations that are formulated at a neutral pH as it aggregates at neutral pH into a cloudy white 667 \nSold by @itachibot precipitate. This reduces the effectiveness of the insulin dose. Insulin degludec and detemir have a pH of 7.4 that is very near to neutral pH and they do not \nform such aggregates when mixed with short-acting insulins. But the manufacturers do not advise manual mixing with short-acting insulin as it may alter the \nactivity profile of the combination that can turn unpredictable. Degludec is available as an \napproved fixed-dose combination with aspart that can be used with predictable effects.",

      "explanation": "The medial part of the thigh is not a preferred site for insulin administration in patients. This is \nbecause of the relatively higher density of blood vessels and nerves in this area. Another \nconsideration is that the inner thighs rub together while walking and may cause soreness at the \ninjection sites. The preferred sites for insulin administration are: • Upper arm • Anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh • Buttocks • Abdomen (with the exception of a circle with a 2-inch radius around the navel) Rotation of the injection site is important to prevent lipodystrophy. However, rotating within one \narea is recommended (e.g., rotating injections systematically within the abdomen) rather than \nrotating to a different area with each injection.
