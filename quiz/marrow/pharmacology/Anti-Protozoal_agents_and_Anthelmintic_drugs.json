      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario and image showing strawberry vagina and cervix are suggestive of \ntrichomoniasis. The drug of choice is metronidazole. It is given as a single dose of 2g. Both metronidazole and tinidazole are effective in the management of trichomonas vaginitis. \nTinidazole has been reported to have fewer GI-related side effects and less resistance compared to \nmetronidazole. However, it is much more expensive and is preferred in cases refractory to \nmetronidazole.",

The \nulcers are multiple and are confined to the colon. Sometimes, in secondary intestinal lesions, the \nulcers are numerous in the cecum, followed by the sigmoido-rectal region. Three classes of drugs are used in the treatment of amebiasis: • Luminal amoebicides- diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, paromomycin, and tetracycline. They act \nin the intestinal lumen but not in tissues. • Tissue amoebicides- emetine and chloroquine. They are effective in systemic infection but less \neffective in the intestine. • Both luminal and tissue amebicides- Metronidazole, tinidazole and imidazole.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Piperazine causes flaccid paralysis of Ascaris lumbricoides. It acts as a GABA receptor agonist and increases chloride ion conductance across the Ascaris \nmuscle membrane. This results in hyperpolarisation and reduced excitability, which leads to \nmuscle relaxation and flaccid paralysis. Metrifonate, levamisole and tribendimidine are anthelminthic drugs that cause spastic paralysis. 540 \nSold by @itachibot",
