        "a": "They inhibit the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I",

        "d": "They are contraindicated in diabetic patients"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The omission of prior diuretic dose decreases the risk of postural hypotension. ACE inhibitors cause arteriolar dilation and increase the compliance of larger arteries. ACE \ninhibitors induced hypotension is thereby due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. In \ndiuretic-treated patients, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is more active to compensate \nfor volume loss. Hence, ACE inhibitors increase the risk of postural hypotension in these \npatients. Option A: ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Option C: Lisinopril is longer acting than enalapril. Lisinopril is usually administered once daily in \nall patients. Enalapril requires twice-daily administration in some patients. Option D: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line agents in diabetic patients because of their \nrenoprotective effects.",

      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors are usually avoided in conditions like pheochromocytoma which is associated \nwith high renin activity. Abrupt inhibition of the RAAS system can result in severe hypotension \n(usually postural). The majority of pheochromocytomas are treated surgically. Phenoxybenzamine is often used in \npreparing the patient for surgery and also to manage hypertension in inoperable or malignant 247 \nSold by @itachibot pheochromocytoma.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors are not contraindicated in unilateral renal artery stenosis, left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction, and scleroderma renal crisis. Patient 1: ACE inhibitors are teratogenic and can cause hypoplasia of organs, renal failure, anuria, \nand growth retardation in the fetus. Therefore, they are contraindicated in pregnancy. Patient 2: ACE inhibitors can be used with caution in unilateral renal artery stenosis if the other \nkidney is functioning normally. Patient 3: Efferent arteriolar constriction maintains the glomerular filtration pressure in bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in bilateral renal stenosis as they can \nprecipitate acute renal failure due to dilation of efferent arterioles and fall in glomerular filtration \npressure. Patient 4: ACE inhibition in patients with systolic dysfunction prevents or delays the progression \nof heart failure, decreases the incidence of sudden death and myocardial infarction, and improves \nthe quality of life. ACE inhibition reduces afterload and systolic wall stress, and both cardiac \noutput and cardiac index increase. Patient 5: The use of ACE inhibitors considerably improves the survival of patients with \nscleroderma renal crisis.",

      "question": "Question 6: A 53-year-old hypertensive patient has been on ACE inhibitors for the last 12 years. Which of \nthe following effects would you expect to see in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Rightward shift in renal pressure natriuresis curve",
        "b": "Reduction in filtration fraction",
        "c": "Significant increase in heart rate",
        "d": "Decrease in compliance of large arteries"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors, when used for a long time in patients with hypertension, cause a reduction in \nfiltration fraction. Filtration fraction is the ratio of GFR to that of renal plasma flow. ACE inhibitors increase renal \nblood flow without altering GFR and thus result in reduction of filtration fraction. Option A: The graph plotted between urinary sodium excretion and mean blood pressure is \nknown as the pressure natriuresis curve. For example, when dietary sodium intake is low, renin \nrelease is stimulated. Angiotensin II acts on the kidneys to shift the renal pressure – natriuresis \ncurve to the right. This increases sodium and water retention. Conversely, when dietary Na+ is high or when ACE inhibitors are used, there is the withdrawal of \nangiotensin II. The renal pressure natriuresis curve shifts to the left. The following image depicts a pressure natriuresis curve: 248 \nSold by @itachibot Options C and D: ACE inhibitors do not cause a significant increase in heart rate and can have a \nfavorable change in the compliance of large arteries on long-term use.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors are associated with the development of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia occurs due to the inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion. \nDecreased aldosterone levels result in decreased tubular excretion of potassium in the kidneys \nleading to hyperkalemia. The adverse effects of ACE inhibitors are: • Hypotension • Hyperkalemia • Cough • Angioedema • Skin rash • Teratogenicity • Dysgeusia (alteration in or loss of taste) Extremely rare but reversible side effects include neutropenia, glycosuria in the absence of \nhyperglycemia, anemia, and hepatotoxicity.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema which occurs due to \nbradykinin. 249 \nSold by @itachibot Angioedema is most commonly mediated by histamine. However, bradykinin-mediated \nangioedema, though less common, can result due to hereditary or acquired defects in C1 esterase \ninhibitor and as a side effect of ACE inhibitors. ACE has structural similarity to another enzyme called kininase. Kininase normally metabolizes \nbradykinin, substance P, and prostaglandins. ACE inhibitors when administered also block \nkininase enzyme which results in an increase in the concentration of these substrates. An increase \nin the level of bradykinin/ substance P levels results in persistent brassy cough and angioedema in \nthe patients.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and image showing swelling of the face and lips is suggestive \nof hereditary angioedema. Icatibant is a selective bradykinin B2 receptor competitive \nantagonist indicated for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema. The other drug which is approved for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema is \necallantide which is a synthetic plasma kallikrein inhibitor.

It binds to the AT1 receptor with \nhigh affinity. it is also a competitive antagonist of the thromboxane A2 receptor and attenuates \nplatelet aggregation. Losartan has no effect on ACE and it does not inhibit bradykinin breakdown. \nThis results in negligible incidences of cough.",
