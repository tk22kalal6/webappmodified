      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "348 \nSold by @itachibot Antidepressants increase levels of neurotransmitters at the synapse by preventing their reuptake. \nDue to a prolonged increase in the levels of neurotransmitters, there is a change in \nneurotransmitter receptor sensitivity which is thought to be the major mechanism responsible for \nthe treatment of depression. Chronic treatment with a number of antidepressants desensitizes presynaptic autoreceptors and \nheteroreceptors, producing long-lasting changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission. \nPostreceptor effects of antidepressant treatment, including modulation of GPCR signaling and \nactivation of protein kinases and ion channels, are involved in the mediation of the long-term \neffects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Moclobemide is a reversible and selective inhibitor of the MAO-A enzyme. Monoamine hypothesis states that in depression, there is a decrease in monoamines like serotonin \n(5HT) and norepinephrine. These monoamines are metabolized by the enzyme monoamine \noxidase (MAO). MAO inhibitors, therefore, increase these monoamines by inhibiting the enzyme.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation of a hypertensive crisis in a patient on MAO inhibitor therapy is \nsuggestive of cheese reaction, which is seen after consumption of foods rich in tyramine (beer). Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic. It induces the release of catecholamines from the \nneurons. Tyramine can be produced in high concentrations in protein-rich foods by \ndecarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation. Normally tyramine is inactivated when taken orally because it is readily metabolized by MAO in \nthe liver. In patients who are on MAO inhibitor therapy, the tyramine taken in the diet is not \ninactivated and results in its increased sympathomimetic effect resulting in elevated blood \npressure, termed as hypertensive crisis or cheese reaction. Drug of choice for cheese reaction is IV \nphentolamine. When MAO inhibitors are taken along with SSRI or TCA, it results in serotonin syndrome due to \nthe overstimulation of 5HT receptors. The clinical features are a triad of: • Cognitive effect - delirium, coma • Autonomic effects- hypertension, tachycardia • Somatic effects- myoclonus, hyperreflexia, tremors 350 \nSold by @itachibot",

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are drugs that act by inhibiting the reuptake of noradrenaline \nand serotonin from the synaptic clefts. The side effects of TCAs are due to blockade of other receptors: • Muscarinic (M) receptors: constipation, dry mouth (not sialorrhea), arrhythmia • Histamine (H1) receptors: sedation • 5HT receptors: weight gain due to increased appetite • Alpha1 receptors: postural hypotension",

      "explanation": "Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline are competitive antagonists of muscarinic receptors. \nAtropine being an antimuscarinic drug should not be administered. Tricyclic antidepressant overdose presents with anticholinergic effects. Hypotension occurs \nbecause of alpha1 receptor blockade. TCAs act on Na+ channels and cause slowed conduction and depressed cardiac contractility \nresulting in serious arrhythmias. Seizures and agitation may occur followed by depression. Management of TCA overdose: • Initial resuscitation by securing airway, breathing, and circulation. • Hypotension - IV fluids and norepinephrine infusion. 352 \nSold by @itachibot • Cardiac-depressant effects - bolus dose of sodium bicarbonate helps overcome Na+ blockade by \nincreasing extracellular Na+. It also addresses metabolic acidosis which is often present. • Arrhythmias - lignocaine for ventricular arrhythmias. • Seizures - benzodiazepines like diazepam/lorazepam. Physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic effects but can aggravate cardiac depression and cause \nseizures. Therefore physostigmine is not recommended.",

      "explanation": "The antianxiety drug buspirone is a partial agonist of 5-HT1A receptors. The most important \nlocations of the 5-HT1A receptor are raphe nuclei of brainstem and hippocampus. It mimics the antianxiety properties of benzodiazepines but does not interact with GABAA \nreceptors or display the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines. Buspirone is \nprimarily used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. 5-HT1A partial agonists are: • Buspirone • Gepirone • Ipsapirone",

Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) mainly used to treat major \ndepressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Nausea is the commonest side effect of SSRIs as they target the 5HT3 receptor. Vivid dreams may occur because the drug suppresses REM sleep (the stage of dream), hence when \npatients eventually fall into REM sleep it may be more intense. Anorgasmia is the persistent inability to achieve orgasm despite responding to sexual stimulation. \nA proposed mechanism of escitalopram causing sexual dysfunction involves stimulation of the \n5HT2C receptors.",

In children and adolescents, there \nappears to be a slightly increased risk of suicidal ideations and attempts, but not of completed \nsuicide. Somatic symptoms of depression improve faster than psychological symptoms when a patient is \nstarted on SSRIs and hence patients have the energy to act on their thoughts of deliberate \nself-harm and suicide (paradoxical suicide). 358 \nSold by @itachibot Opioids - Functions and Classification",
