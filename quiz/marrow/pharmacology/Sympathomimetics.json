      "explanation": "Vasomotor reversal of Dale is a blockade of alpha ( 1) followed by stimulation of beta (2) \nreceptors. Normally, a high dose of epinephrine injected produces an  1-mediated rise in BP followed by a \n2-mediated fall in BP. Administration of epinephrine after administration of  -blockers produces only a fall in BP.

Adrenaline acts on  1,  2, 1, 2, and 3 receptors.  1 - present in blood vessels - causes vasoconstriction - increases BP. 2 - present in blood vessels - causes vasodilatation - decreases BP.

IV noradrenaline acts on  1,  2, and 1 receptors: •  1- vasoconstriction - Increases DBP. • 1 - increases heart rate and contractility - Increases SBP. • This increases mean arterial pressure which causes a reflex vagal activity that decreases the heart \nrate leading to bradycardia.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Dobutamine is used to perform a stress test. Stress echocardiography is primarily done for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. The basic \nprinciple is to increase cardiac stress (either with exercise or with a drug) in a controlled fashion, \nto aid with the identification and localization of ischemic areas (by detecting new or worsening \nwall motion abnormalities). Performing stress echocardiography with a pharmacologic agent such as dobutamine allows for \nsimulation of increased heart rate and increased myocardial physiologic demands in patients who \nmay be unable to exercise due to musculoskeletal or pulmonary comorbidities. Dobutamine causes cardiac stress by acting on 1-adrenergic receptors to increase cardiac \ncontractility and heart rate, and on 2-adrenergic receptors to cause peripheral vasodilatation. It \nis preferred over vasodilators used in stress echo tests such as adenosine, dipyridamole, and \nregadenoson (adenosine derivative).",

Adverse effects of beta 2 agonists: • Hypokalemia - direct effect on skeletal muscle uptake of K+ ions • Tachycardia - reflex sympathetic stimulation due to vasodilator action on 2 receptors and direct \neffect on cardiac 1 receptors (2 selectivity is lost at high concentrations) • Muscle tremors - direct effect on 2 receptors in skeletal muscles and due to hypokalemia • Hyperglycaemia • Hyperlipidemia • Tolerance - desensitization on long-term use",

      "explanation": "108 \nSold by @itachibot Tremors due to 2 agonists can be both due to direct action on muscle spindle and hypokalemia. Initially, it was thought to be due to beta receptor-mediated enhancement of discharge of muscle \nspindles. However, recently the tremors have also been closely correlated with hypokalemia. \nHence both direct action and hypokalemia can explain the tremors associated with 2 agonist use, \nalthough the exact mechanism is still not known.",

      "explanation": "Mirabegron is a 3 agonist used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Stimulation of \n3 receptors in detrusor muscle increases the bladder capacity and provides symptomatic relief in \noveractive bladder. Antimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of oral pharmacological treatment for OAB. It acts by \ninhibiting muscarinic receptor subtypes, M2 and M3 in the bladder. Both subtypes are expressed \nin multiple tissues, resulting in anticholinergic adverse events such as dry mouth, constipation, \nand cognitive impairment. These adverse effects are not seen with mirabegron as it acts via \nadrenergic receptors. Mirabegron is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Hence, caution has to be exercised when \nprescribing it along with CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, desipramine, digoxin.",

      "explanation": "Epinephrine (1:1000 solution) 0.5 ml via intramuscular route is preferred in the treatment of \nanaphylactic shock.

There is a much greater risk of causing harmful side effects by either inappropriate dosage or \nmisdiagnosis of anaphylaxis when using IV adrenaline. Hence, IM injection is preferred over \nintravenous (IV) bolus because it is faster in many situations and safer (lower risk of \ncardiovascular complications, such as severe hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias). For intramuscular, subcutaneous, and inhalational (nebulization) routes of administration, 1:1000 \ndilution can be used. 109 \nSold by @itachibot In cardiac arrest, the 1:1000 adrenaline must be diluted to 1:10,000 for IV use.

      "explanation": "The benefit of using noradrenaline in septicemia is that it increases the mean arterial blood \npressure. It acts as a powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor and inotrope. Noradrenaline causes a rise in both systolic BP and diastolic BP, resulting in a rise in the mean \narterial blood pressure. This increases the organ perfusion in patients in septic shock \nor cardiogenic shock. Another advantage of noradrenaline is that it does so without causing tachycardia, which is often \na troublesome event with other inotropes in critical care. Options A and B: The rise in mean arterial pressure causes reflex bradycardia which is not a major \ncontributor to the treatment of septic shock. Option C: Low-dose dopamine infusions and furosemide are used to increase urine output in \ncritically ill patients.",
