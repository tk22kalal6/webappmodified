      "explanation": "Co-trimoxazole is a combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole in the dose ratio of \n1:5 (trimethoprim : sulfamethoxazole). The antimicrobial activity of this combination is because of its actions on sequential steps in the \npathway of synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid as shown in the image. Each agent alone usually exerts bacteriostatic activity. But when an organism is sensitive to both \nagents, bactericidal activity may be achieved. Because trimethoprim is more lipid-soluble than sulfamethoxazole, it has a larger volume of \ndistribution than the latter drug. Therefore, when 1 part of trimethoprim is given with 5 parts of sulfamethoxazole (dose ratio is 1:5; \ntrimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole), the peak plasma concentrations are in the ratio of 1:20, which is \noptimal for the combined effects of these drugs in vitro.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given neurovisceral symptoms following the use of sulfonamides point towards a diagnosis of \nacute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is a rare heme biosynthesis disorder due to a partial deficiency of the enzyme \nporphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Diagnosis is made based on elevated urine PBG levels. \nAlcohol, infections, pregnancy, and certain medications can trigger attacks by inducing heme \nsynthesis. This results in the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, causing symptoms. Side effects of sulfonamides are: • Acute intermittent porphyria - sulphonamides precipitate attacks • Hypersensitivity reaction - urticaria, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme of the \nStevens-Johnson type, exfoliative dermatitis, and photosensitivity 442 \nSold by @itachibot • Crystalluria - due to low solubility. It is treated with good hydration and alkalization of urine • Hemolysis in G-6-PD deficiency (sulphonamides are oxidizers) • Kernicterus in the newborn (displace bilirubin)",

      "explanation": "Fluoroquinolones inhibit two essential type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase (in gram-negative \nbacteria) and topoisomerase IV (in gram-positive bacteria). DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils and thereby reduces the torsional strain that occurs \nwhen double-stranded DNA is being unwound for replication or translation. Topoisomerases IV is \nresponsible for unlinking daughter chromosomes after replication. Quinolone antibiotics form a \ncomplex with the topoisomerase enzyme and the DNA, and thereby block DNA replication and \nbacterial cell division.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The patient had most likely been prescribed nitrofurantoin as the scenario depicts side effects of \nthis drug. Nitrofurantoin is a urinary antiseptic used against lower UTI caused by E.coli and enterococci. Its \nuse results in brown urine. It is also associated with acute pneumonitis with fever, chills, cough, \ndyspnea, chest pain, pulmonary infiltration, and eosinophilia within hours to days of initiation of \ntherapy. The symptoms resolve quickly after discontinuation of the drug. The antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin is due to its intracellular conversion to highly reactive \nintermediates by bacterial reductases. These intermediates react nonspecifically with ribosomal \nproteins and disrupt the synthesis of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic processes.",

      "explanation": "Pefloxacin is mainly metabolized in the liver and hence avoided in patients with liver disease. Quinolones with primarily hepatic metabolism include moxifloxacin, pefloxacin, and trovafloxacin \n(withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity). Quinolones primarily excreted by the kidneys include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, \nlomefloxacin, and ofloxacin. 446 \nSold by @itachibot Antimicrobials Acting on 30s Subunit",
