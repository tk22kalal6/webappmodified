      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most important mechanism of antiepileptic activity of phenytoin is the prolongation of Na+ \nion channel inactivation. It slows down the rate of recovery of Na+ channels and thus limiting the \npropagation of the action potential. Phenytoin also inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This reduces the influx of calcium inside the \nmembrane and reduces the inflow of potassium ions during repolarization. At higher or toxic doses, phenytoin facilitates GABA response and inhibits the action of glutamate.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Phenytoin follows first-order kinetics at lower concentrations and as the concentration increases, \nthe elimination changes to zero-order kinetics. The rate of elimination of phenytoin varies with \nthe serum concentration. As the blood levels rise, the maximal capacity of the liver to metabolize phenytoin is reached. Thus \neven a small increase in the dosage can result in disproportionally high plasma levels. Therefore, \nit requires therapeutic drug monitoring. About 90% of phenytoin is bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Phenytoin is metabolized \nby the CYP enzymes in the liver.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Fosphenytoin like phenytoin requires continuous ECG monitoring during IV infusion due to the \nrisk of arrhythmias. Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin. Fosphenytoin is also extensively protein \nbound, mainly albumin. This binding is saturable and fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin from \nprotein-binding sites. Hydrolysis of fosphenytoin yields phosphate, which increases the risk of hyperphosphatemia in \npatients with renal failure. It is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, sino-atrial \nblock, second and third-degree A-V block. 278 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Carbamazepine is indicated in focal seizures with impaired awareness. Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that acts by prolonging the inactivated state of the Na+ \nchannel similar to phenytoin. It is used in: • Focal seizures with impaired awareness • Focal seizures with intact awareness • Generalized tonic-clonic seizures • Trigeminal and related neuralgias • Manic depressive psychosis. Option B: Carbamazepine is an enzyme inducer. It is a substrate as well as an inducer of CYP3A4 \nand CYP2C9. Option C: Carbamazepine causes hyponatremia and not hypernatremia. Other side effects of \ncarbamazepine include agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, water retention and \nhyponatremia (by potentiating ADH action ), and dose-related neurotoxicity.

      "explanation": "The risk of hyponatremia with oxcarbazepine is higher when compared to carbamazepine. Option A: Oxcarbazepine is a keto analog of carbamazepine. It is a prodrug. The mechanism of \naction of oxcarbazepine is by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (same as carbamazepine). Option C: Active form is metabolized by glucuronide conjugation.

      "explanation": "Phenytoin on long-term use can result in pseudolymphoma. This lymphadenopathy can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lymphoma. Although some \nstudies suggest a causal relationship between phenytoin use and Hodgkin’s disease, the data are \nfar from conclusive. Almost all lesions are benign and termed as pseudolymphoma.",

      "explanation": "Gingival hyperplasia occurs in patients on chronic phenytoin therapy. It is the most common \nmanifestation in children and young adolescents. Gingival hyperplasia due to phenytoin therapy occurs due to tissue overgrowth secondary to \naltered collagen metabolism. The toothless portion of gums is not involved. It does not warrant \ndiscontinuation of the drug. It can be minimized by maintaining good oral hygiene.",

      "explanation": "Eslicarbazepine acetate is an analog of carbamazepine that has the advantage of once-daily \ndosing. It is a prodrug and is rapidly converted to active licarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine is an analog of carbamazepine that is also converted to licarbazepine. \nOxcarbazepine does not have the advantage of once-daily dosing like eslicarbazepine acetate. Dacarbazine is not a carbamazepine analog like the other drugs and is a chemotherapy medication \nused in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. 284 \nSold by @itachibot",
