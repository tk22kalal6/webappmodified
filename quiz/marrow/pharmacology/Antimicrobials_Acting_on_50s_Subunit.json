      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Gray baby syndrome is associated with the use of chloramphenicol, especially in premature \ninfants. It develops due to the developmental deficiency of the enzyme glucoronyl transferase. This \nenzyme metabolizes chloramphenicol in neonates. Its deficiency leads to an inability to excrete 466 \nSold by @itachibot unconjugated drugs adequately through renal excretion. The initial symptoms are: • Vomiting • Refusal to suck • Irregularly rapid respiration • Periods of cyanosis. After 1-2 days: • Flaccid baby • Hypothermia • Ashen-gray color skin discoloration If there is a recovery, usually there are no sequelae.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Chloramphenicol acts by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit. It inhibits the binding of amino acid containing tRNA to acceptor site on 50s subunit of the \nribosome.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The patient is most likely to have aplastic anemia, as it is the most common blood dyscrasia \nassociated with the use of chloramphenicol.

      "explanation": "Quinupristin and dalfopristin are a combination of streptogramins and the synergistic activity of \nthese drugs has bactericidal action. Quinupristin binds to the 50s subunit of ribosomes and acts similar to macrolides by interfering \nin translocation and inhibiting protein synthesis. Dalfopristin binds to a site nearby, resulting in conformational changes in the 50S ribosome \nthereby increasing the activity of quinupristin. The synergic activity of these drugs can have \nbactericidal action in certain susceptible bacteria. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against gram-positive cocci and organisms responsible for \natypical pneumonia (e.g., M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and C. pneumoniae).
