        "d": "Phospholipase-A2 is a housekeeping enzyme."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is primarily a housekeeping enzyme. NSAIDs act by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2. • COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells. It performs housekeeping functions like \ngastrointestinal cytoprotection, fluid and electrolyte balance in the kidney. • COX-2 is normally present in insignificant amounts in most of the cells. It is induced by \ncytokines, growth factors and other stimuli during inflammation. Phospholipase-A2 is the initial enzyme that acts on the membrane phospholipids to generate \narachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid produces prostaglandins by the action of the cyclooxygenase \nenzymes (COX).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "707 \nSold by @itachibot Thromboxane A2 is a pro-aggregatory eicosanoid whose formation requires the activity of COX \nenzyme. Aspirin blocks this step, thus reducing the chances of clot formation. Thromboxane A2 is an inducer of platelet aggregation and amplifies the signal of more potent \nplatelet agonists, such as thrombin and ADP.",

      "explanation": "Rioprostil is a PGE1 analog and is not indicated in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Long term therapy with PGI2 analogs can delay or preclude the need for lung or heart-lung \ntransplantation. PGI2 analogs used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension are: • Epoprostenol (IV) • Iloprost (IV) • Treprostinil (IV or SC) PGI2 (Epoprostenol) can also be used to prevent platelet aggregation and damage during \nhaemodialysis or cardiopulmonary bypass.

        "d": "Its antiplatelet effect at low dose is related to presystemic COX inhibition."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Aspirin clearance is dependent on plasma concentration at a lower dose. Aspirin shows saturation kinetics. This means that at lower plasma concentrations it has \nfirst-order kinetics where the rate of elimination is proportional to the plasma 708 \nSold by @itachibot concentration but at higher plasma concentrations it has zero-order kinetics where the rate of \nelimination is independent of its plasma concentration. Around 80-90% of aspirin (salicylates) are bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. Low dose aspirin acetylates the COX enzyme of platelets in the portal circulation (pre-systemic) \nand deactivates it which is responsible for antiplatelet action. Aspirin and salicylates are acidic in nature. Alkalinization of the urine increases the rate of \nexcretion of aspirin, as ionised form of aspirin increases which is not reabsorbed from the tubular \nfluid in kidney.",

Children and young adults less than 20 years of age with viral fever have a risk of developing \nReye's syndrome on administration of aspirin or other salicylates. Features of Reye syndrome include: • Acute onset of encephalopathy • Liver dysfunction • Fatty infiltration of the liver Option A - Acetaminophen is considered the antipyretic of choice in children with viral infections.

      "explanation": "Piroxicam is chosen as it has the longest plasma half-life among NSAIDs. Piroxicam is absorbed completely and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Due to the long \nhalf-life, once-daily administration of the drug is sufficient for the therapeutic response.",

        "d": "It has antiplatelet action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. As COX-2 enzyme is constitutively active within the \nkidney, recommended doses of selective COX-2 inhibitors cause renal toxicities similar to those \nassociated with traditional NSAIDs. Option B - It is less likely to cause gastric ulcers. Celecoxib has analgesic, antipyretic, and \nanti-inflammatory effects similar to those of non-selective NSAIDs but with better gastrointestinal \ntolerability. Option C - It inhibits COX-2-mediated prostacyclin synthesis in the vascular endothelium. As a \nresult, use of celecoxib is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. 709 \nSold by @itachibot Option D - Celecoxib at usual doses does not inhibit platelet aggregation. This is because platelet \naggregation is mediated by thromboxane produced by the COX-1. These points are also true for other selective COX-2 inhibitors.",

      "explanation": "Acetaminophen does not antagonize effects of uricosuric agents. It may be used concomitantly \nwith probenecid in the treatment of gout as it does not have any effect on uric acid levels. Option A - Acetaminophen has analgesic and antipyretic action equivalent to aspirin but lacks a \nsignificant anti-inflammatory effect.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The patient in the given clinical scenario has ingested a potentially toxic dose of acetaminophen. \nN-acetylcysteine is considered as a definitive antidote for acetaminophen poisoning to prevent \nhepatic injury. N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is a toxic metabolite of acetaminophen which causes \nhepatotoxicity. In adults, hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of 10–15 g \n(150–250 mg/kg) of acetaminophen; doses of 20–25 g or more are potentially fatal. 710 \nSold by @itachibot In acetaminophen poisoning, due to increased NAPQI, there is utilization of glutathione (GSH). \nThis in turn leads to depletion of GSH leading to oxidative cellular damage of the \nhepatocytes. N-acetylcysteine replenishes GSH stores and also conjugates with NAPQI and \nprevents oxidative damage to the cell. It also protects against extrahepatic injury due to its \nantioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Option A: Flumazenil is an antidote for benzodiazepine toxicity. Option C: Methylene blue is used in methemoglobinemia. Option D: Symptoms may take upto 2 days to develop in a case of acetaminophen poisoning by \nwhich time the hepatic damage may become irreversible.
