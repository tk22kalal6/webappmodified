      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Blackouts are periods of memory loss that occur with high ethanol consumption and may result \nfrom the ability of ethanol to inhibit the action of glutamate on NMDA receptors. NMDA receptor is implicated in many aspects of cognitive function including learning and \nmemory.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Ethanol inhibits the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/ vasopressin from the posterior \npituitary gland. This results in enhanced diuresis observed with ethanol ingestion. Inhibition of ADH action in collecting tubules is not the mechanism by which alcohol induces \ndiuresis. Stimulation of ADH release or action will have an antidiuretic action.",

      "explanation": "Acute consumption of ethanol inhibits the function of several cytochrome enzymes that are \ninvolved in the metabolism of drugs. CYP2E1 is one of the isoenzymes that is specifically \ninhibited. Chronic consumption of alcohol causes induction of cytochrome enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, \nincreasing the rate of metabolism of drugs dependent on CYP2E1 for metabolism.",

      "explanation": "Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde \ndehydrogenase. Ethanol consumption during disulfiram therapy can lead to increased concentrations of \nacetaldehyde. Increased acetaldehyde levels can cause flushing, pulsating headache, throbbing \npain in the head and neck, and other aversive reactions. Disulfiram is indicated in alcohol deaddiction maintenance therapy. Option 1: Fomepizole is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Option 3: Acamprosate is an NMDA receptor antagonist with modest GABA-A receptor agonistic \nactivity. Option 4: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that suppresses craving in chronic alcoholics. 401 \nSold by @itachibot Option 5: Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat acute alcohol withdrawal \nand anxiety.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical picture and labs are suggestive of accidental methanol toxicity. Hemodialysis is \nused in severe cases of methanol toxicity. 402 \nSold by @itachibot A serum methanol concentration greater than 50 mg/dl is serious enough to consider \nhemodialysis. It can be used to remove both methanol and its toxic metabolite formic acid from \nthe blood. Option A: Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, is administered intravenously in \nmethanol toxicity. It acts by inhibiting the formation of formic acid. Option B: Intravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole. It has a higher affinity to alcohol \ndehydrogenase than methanol. Thus, saturation of ADH enzymes results in less formation of toxic \nformic acid. Option D: Folate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to CO2. Both \nfolinic and folic acid are often administered during methanol toxicity but the exact benefit is yet to \nbe determined. Note: Ethanol is given intravenously in the management of methanol and ethylene glycol \npoisoning.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Administration of ethanol slows down the metabolism of methanol. Ethanol has a higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than methanol. Formic acid is the metabolite of methanol which is highly toxic. Therefore, slowing down the \nmetabolism of methanol reduces its toxic effects.",

This can cause aversive reactions resulting in flushing, pulsating headache, \nthrobbing pain in the head and neck, nausea, vomiting, rashes, respiratory difficulties, chest pain, \nand autonomic manifestations. Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde \ndehydrogenase. It is used in behavioral modification for alcohol de-addiction. Option B: The principle of action is aversive conditioning (not anti-craving). Option C: Disulfiram can be given only to highly motivated individuals. It should not be \nadministered until the person has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. Option D: The disulfiram-alcohol reaction may persist as long as 14 days after the last dose of \ndisulfiram. 403 \nSold by @itachibot Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders",
