      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Rosiglitazone does not increase insulin release from the beta cells of the pancreas. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that acts by activating PPAR-gamma (nuclear receptor) which \ninduces several genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and thereby, decreases insulin \nresistance. Nateglinide (a meglitinide) and glimepiride, tolbutamide (both sulfonylureas) are insulin \nsecretagogues that act by inhibiting the ATP-sensitive K+ channels of the beta cells of the pancreas \nto cause insulin release.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "651 \nSold by @itachibot Repaglinide acts by increasing insulin secretion by blockage of ATP-sensitive K+ channels of the \nbeta cells of the pancreas. When ATP-sensitive K+ channels are blocked, it will lead to depolarization of beta cells and the \nrelease of insulin. Sulfonylureas also act by this similar mechanism. Option B - Metformin is an insulin sensitizer and also inhibits gluconeogenesis and increases \nhepatic uptake of glucose. Option C - Exenatide is a GLP-1 analog. Option D - Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor.",

      "explanation": "Metformin does not act by increasing insulin secretion. It decreases insulin resistance and increases the peripheral utilization of glucose. Metformin is a biguanide that acts by activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase activation and \nthereby mediates a series of actions that helps in reducing hepatic glucose production. Option A - Metformin has minimal to nil effect on insulin secretion and as a result, has minimal \nor no hypoglycemic effect in non-diabetic patients. Option C - Metformin reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases the insulin-mediated peripheral \nglucose uptake and also decreases the absorption of glucose from the gut.

      "explanation": "The central pharmacological action of metformin is to reduce hepatic glucose production by \ninhibiting gluconeogenesis. Metformin effect is mainly mediated through activation of AMPK and \naltering the energy dynamics at mitochondrial respiration. Option A - The reduction in glucose absorption can also occur but the contribution to the \nantihyperglycemic action is not significant Option B - Metformin increases peripheral glucose utilization by both insulin-dependent (reducing \ninsulin resistance) and independent ways. But the current evidence does not support the \nreduction in insulin resistance as the primary mechanism of metformin's action. Option D - Recent evidence shows blunting of glucagon effects as one of the mechanisms of \nmetformin's action Note: All are mechanisms of metformin, however, the key action is Option C and it is the most \nappropriate answer.",

Metformin dose should be \nreduced when the eGFR is less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Metformin is excreted by the kidneys, and accumulation with reduced kidney function may \nincrease the risk of lactic acidosis (due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis). It is \ncontraindicated below eGFR&lt;30. eGFR is obtained at baseline and at least annually in all patients taking metformin. It is \nrecommended that the eligibility of CKD patients for metformin administration be changed from \none based on a single laboratory parameter (blood creatinine concentration) to one that provides a \nbetter estimate of kidney function in patients with kidney disease i.e., glomerular filtration rate \nestimating equation (eGFR).",

Pioglitazone is known to cause fluid retention and edema and is therefore avoided in patients who \nhave heart failure. It is not avoided in all cardiovascular diseases. Option A - Pioglitazone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Option B - Pioglitazone is a selective agonist of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \n(PPAR). It modulates the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin \nsignal transduction and adipocyte differentiation. These effects increase the sensitivity of the \ntissues to insulin. Option C - Pioglitazone does not increase insulin levels in the body. It sensitizes the tissues to the \naction of insulin. Hence, insulin is needed for the action of pioglitazone. However, it does not \nneed insulin to modulate the expression of genes.",
