      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Oseltamivir and zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors. They competitively and reversibly interact with the enzyme sites to inhibit viral neuraminidase \nactivity. This interferes with the release of the progeny from infected host cells, halting the spread \nof infection. Early administration hastens the resolution of symptoms if given within 48 h of infection. \nOseltamivir is given at a dose of 75 mg, BD for 5 days for the treatment of Influenza A and B. For prophylaxis, it is given at a dose of 75mg, OD and continued for the duration of exposure.",
