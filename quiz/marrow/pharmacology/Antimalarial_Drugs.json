      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "424 \nSold by @itachibot Pyrimethamine is a slow-acting schizonticide. Female Anopheles mosquito inoculates Plasmodium species in the form of sporozoites into the \nhuman host during blood meal. Sporozoites migrate to the liver and mature into hepatic \nschizonts. Hepatic schizonts are released into the blood in the form of merozoites. Merozoites in \nthe erythrocyte transform into ring form and erythrocytic schizonts. Some merozoites in the blood \ntransform into gametocytes. Antimalarial drugs are classified based on their onset of action of schizonticidal function as below: • Fast onset of action • Artemisinin derivatives like artemether , arteether and artesunate are fastest acting • Chloroquine • Intermediate onset of action • Mefloquine • Quinine • Proguanil • Lumefantrine • Slow onset of action • Pyrimethamine • Sulfonamides • Tetracyclines • Clindamycin",

      "explanation": "Radical cure is required for malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale. In case of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, malarial parasites have an exoerythrocytic \nstage (hypnozoites). In the exoerythrocytic phase malarial parasites are found in the liver that can \ncause relapse of malaria after clinical cure. Therefore, they require radical cure by drugs acting on the exoerythrocytic stage. Primaquine is \neffective against the exoerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale in the \nliver. Primaquine is administered for 14 days for radical cure.",

Worldwide, most species of Falciparum malaria are resistant to chloroquine. In all trimesters, \npregnant women diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum infection can be treated with a combination of quinine and clindamycin. Quinine is considered the drug of choice in the first trimester. In the second and third trimesters \nartemether-lumefantrine can be used, but not in the first trimester. Vivax malaria during pregnancy is treated with chloroquine as chloroquine is safe in pregnancy \nand children. Clindamycin can be used in children for chloroquine-resistant cases. It is safe to use in children \nand pregnant women. Option B: Doxycycline is useful in the treatment of malaria but not used in pregnancy. Options C and D: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is not recommended during the \n1st trimester of pregnancy because of a lack of safety data.",
