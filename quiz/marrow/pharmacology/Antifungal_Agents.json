      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The site of action of amphotericin B in fungi is the cell membrane. Amphotericin B binds to the ergosterol in the cell membrane of fungi and forms pores or \nchannels. They increase the permeability of the membrane to ions and cause leakage of cytosolic \nmolecules. This leads to a loss of integrity of the cell membrane and causes fungicidal effects. Recent evidence suggests that the amphotericin B sequesters ergosterol from lipid layers, much \nlike a sponge, resulting in fungal cell death.",
