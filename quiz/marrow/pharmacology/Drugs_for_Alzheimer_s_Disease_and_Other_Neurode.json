      "question": "Question 1: A 70-year-old male patient is brought to the OPD by his son, with complaints of increasing \nforgetfulness. Neuroimaging shows marked cortical atrophy of temporal and parietal lobes. \nWhat is the most striking neurochemical disturbance in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Deficiency of acetylcholine",
        "b": "Deficiency of dopamine",
        "c": "Deficiency of serotonin",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most striking \nneurochemical disturbance in AD is the deficiency of acetylcholine in the subcortical area \n(especially in the nucleus basalis of Meynert). Neurotransmitters like glutamate and 5-HT and other areas of the brain like the hippocampus are \nalso involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. The drugs used in Alzheimer's disease are: • Central acetylcholine esterase inhibitors targeting acetylcholine deficiency • NMDA antagonists targeting glutamate excitotoxicity 407 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is available as a transdermal patch for use in \nAlzheimer's disease. It can be applied for over 24 hours. Transdermal delivery reduces the \nfluctuation and avoids direct gastric irritation effects associated with oral formulations. Option A: Tacrine is an anticholinesterase that is obsolete because of its association with \nhepatotoxicity. Options B and D: Donepezil and galantamine transdermal formulations are under development \nand yet to be available in the market.",

It slows the deterioration of patients with moderate and severe Alzheimer's \ndisease. It is claimed to reduce the excitotoxicity of glutamate.

SSRIs like citalopram or benzodiazepines for agitation and atypical antipsychotics for psychiatric \nsymptoms may be considered in severe cases.

Option A - Amyloid beta-directed monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of \nAlzheimer's disease are - lecanemab, donanemab, aducanumab 408 \nSold by @itachibot Option B - Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used and are considered as first-line in early or \nmild to moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease. Option C - Memantine is approved only in moderate-severe Alzheimer's disease. There is not \nenough data to support its use in mild to moderate stages.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a \nlife-threatening disease caused by the JC virus in patients with multiple sclerosis. It is more common when the patient is immunocompromised during their treatment with \nnatalizumab. The current recommendation is to start natalizumab only in a patient who tests \nnegative for JC antibodies. Seroconversion can occur anytime during treatment. Regular monitoring for JC antibody every 6 \nmonths is recommended in JC antibody-negative patients on natalizumab.",

      "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from chorea associated with Huntington's disease, for which \ntetrabenazine is indicated. It is a reversible inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 \n(VMAT-2). Other drugs used in Huntington's disease are: • Reserpine, an irreversible inhibitor of VMAT-2 and a longer-acting agent as compared to \ntetrabenazine. • Deutetrabenazine refers to deuterium attached to carbon in place of hydrogen, in tetrabenazine \n(deuterated tetrabenazine). It is a newer form of tetrabenazine approved for the treatment of \nchorea associated with Huntington's disease. It slows down its metabolism, hence it is longer \nacting than tetrabenazine. It is associated with better control of chorea. Option A - Benzhexol is a central anticholinergic indicated in parkinsonism. Option C - Tetrahydrozoline is a topical alpha-adrenergic agonist indicated for the relief of \nconjunctival congestion. Option D - Benztropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that can be used for the management \nof acute dystonia.",

Riluzole is the only drug known to improve survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also \nknown as Lou Gehrig's disease. The mechanism of action involves the reduction of \nglutamate-induced excitotoxicity by: • Inhibition of glutamate release • Antagonism of NMDA and kainate-type glutamate receptor • Direct action on the voltage-dependent sodium channels. 410 \nSold by @itachibot",

Subsequent treatment cycles \nconsist of dosing on 10 of 14 days, followed by a 14 day drug-free period. The major adverse effect of edaravone is hypersensitivity because the infusion contains sodium \nbisulfite. Other adverse effects include bruising, gait disorder, and headache. Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib), are both indicated as monotherapy in BRAF \nV600E/K (BRAF V600E mutation-positive) melanoma. They are approved for combined \nadministration, for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) that cannot be removed by \nsurgery or that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).
