      "explanation": "718 \nSold by @itachibot The 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel receptor. It rapidly depolarizes nerve endings by \nopening the cation channels located within the receptor. The 5-HT3 receptors are located in the GI tract (vagal &amp; splanchnic afferents) and the brain \n(nucleus tractus solitarius &amp; area postrema) and are involved in the emetic response. \nHence 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron, dolasetron etc are used as antiemetics. All other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors.",

      "explanation": "Sulfinpyrazone is a uricosuric agent that promotes excretion of uric acid. It is used to decrease the \nbody pool of urate in patients with gout. They act by inhibiting the organic anion transporter that \nis involved in uric acid reabsorption in renal tubules. Uricosuric agents used in gout are: • Probenecid • Sulfinpyrazone • Benzbromarone • Lesinurad Uricosuric therapy should be initiated in gouty patients with underexcretion of uric acid and when \nallopurinol or febuxostat is contraindicated or when tophi are present.

Indomethacin is commonly used in the initial treatment of gout. In addition to inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, indomethacin and other NSAIDs also inhibit \nurate crystal phagocytosis. Option A - Aspirin is not used because it causes renal retention of uric acid at low doses. It is \nuricosuric only at higher doses that are poorly tolerated.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Erenumab-aooe is a calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for the \nprophylaxis of migraine. The pathology of migraine is not completely understood but it includes activation of trigeminal \nganglion nociceptive neurons and the subsequent release of CGRP from fibers associated with \nmeningeal vessels. This is believed to mediate vasodilation and mast cell degranulation. Thus, \nCGRP is involved in the development and maintenance of persistent pain, central sensitization \nand allodynia, which are events characteristic of migraine pathology. Blockage of CGRP receptors by CGRP receptor antagonists, causes inhibition of the inflammatory \nand nociceptive effects of CGRP at multiple sites within the peripheral and central nervous \nsystems that are implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine. Monoclonal antibodies that directly inhibit CGRP have also been developed. These include: • Fremanezumab • Galcanezumab Note: The FDA has recently approved Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor \nantagonist for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.
