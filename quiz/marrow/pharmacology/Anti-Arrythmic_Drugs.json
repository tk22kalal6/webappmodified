However, \nit increases mortality probably by precipitating heart block or congestive heart failure. Hence it is \nnot routinely used for prophylaxis in MI patients but it is used only when indicated. Gastrointestinal absorption of lignocaine is good but bioavailability is very less due to high \nfirst-pass hepatic metabolism. Therefore, it is not used through the oral route. Lignocaine has a high volume of distribution. The loading dose is required to achieve rapid \naction. In heart failure, both volumes of distribution and clearance are reduced. Both the loading dose \nand maintenance dose have to be reduced. 227 \nSold by @itachibot",
