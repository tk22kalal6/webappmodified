      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Preconceptional intake of vitamin B9 (folic acid) results in decreased incidence of neural tube \ndefects like spina bifida, encephalocele, and anencephaly. All women of reproductive age should be given 400 µg of folic acid daily. Women, who had fetal \nneural tube defects in the previous pregnancy, should be given 4 mg of folic acid daily beginning 1 \nmonth before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "Among the following, chloroquine is the least likely drug to precipitate folic acid deficiency. The drugs that can result in the deficiency of folic acid include anticonvulsants (phenytoin, \nprimidone), oral contraceptives, and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (trimethoprim, \nsulfasalazine, methotrexate). Megaloblastic anemia can be caused by a deficiency of folic acid or \nvitamin B12. A mnemonic for the causes of megaloblastic anemia is: Prime BATSMAN • Prime – phenytoin, primidone • B – B12 and folate deficiency • A – alcohol • T – Trimethoprim • S – Sulfasalazine • M – Metformin 754 \nSold by @itachibot • A – Antifolate (methotrexate) • N – N2O",

      "explanation": "Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) should never be administered through the intravenous route. This \nis because IV administration will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine. Cyanocobalamin is usually administered by the intramuscular or deep subcutaneous route. In \npatients with a previous history of sensitivity to vitamin B12 injections, an intradermal skin test of \ncyanocobalamine should be done.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The absorption of iron is impeded by egg-based foods. They contain a high amount of phosphates \n(egg yolk) that form complexes with iron and impede absorption. Heme-based iron, present in meat products, is easily absorbed without the aid of a carrier and is \nnot much affected by other foods. Inorganic iron is affected by several factors. Factors increasing iron absorption are: • Reducing substances such as ascorbic acid and amino acids containing –SH groups - reduce \nferric iron to the soluble ferrous form • Meat-based foods - enhance heme absorption and increase acid secretion. Factors decreasing iron absorption are: • Phosphates, phytates, and tetracyclines - by forming complexes • Alkalies - prevents the reduction of ferric iron to the soluble ferrous form • Presence of other food in the stomach - by increasing pH",

      "explanation": "Erythropoietin decreases the need for blood transfusions and increases reticulocyte counts. Therapeutic uses and effects of erythropoietin: • The primary indication of erythropoietin is anaemia due to chronic renal failure • It causes functional iron deficiency due to the inability to mobilize iron stores rapidly enough to \nsupport the increased erythropoiesis (low transferrin saturation) • It increases the hematocrit, haemoglobin and reduces the need for transfusions • It aggravates hypertension due to an increase in hematocrit and leads to thrombus formation • Release of reticulocyte into circulation from the marrow and results in an increase in reticulocyte \ncount.",
