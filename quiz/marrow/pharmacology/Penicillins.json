Transpeptidase enzyme and related proteins constitute the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) \nwhich are present in the bacterial cell membrane. Transpepetidase is involved in the synthesis of \npeptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. All -lactam groups of antibiotics bind to PBPs and inhibit \nthe last step in peptidoglycan synthesis. 494 \nSold by @itachibot Mutation in the different PBPs confers resistance to the bacteria against the beta-lactams. \nMethicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurs due to alteration in the PBPs.
