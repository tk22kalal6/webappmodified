      "question": "Question 1: A 50-year-old man was rushed to the ER with impaired consciousness following a hunger \nstrike for a day. His wife reported, he had a head injury 1 month back and since then had \ncomplaints of polyuria. On examination, he was found to be severely dehydrated and MRI \nbrain showed an absence of the characteristic bright spot in the pituitary. Which of the \nfollowing is the drug of choice for his condition?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Desmopressin",
        "b": "Amiloride",
        "c": "Thiazide diuretics",
        "d": "Triamterene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario of polyuria following a head injury and an absence of a pituitary bright spot on \nthe MRI brain is suggestive of central diabetes insipidus. The drug of choice for this condition is \ndesmopressin, a V2 receptor agonist. Mechanism of action of desmopressin is: It stimulates the V2 receptors on the basolateral \nmembrane of the principal cells in the collecting tubules. This increases the insertion of water \nchannels (aquaporin 2) into the apical membrane. This leads to increased water reabsorption in \nthe collecting ducts. Activation of V2 receptors also increase the permeability of urea. Option B: Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is indicated for lithium-induced \nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Option C: Thiazides paradoxically exert an antidiuretic effect in DI but are not the drugs of choice. \nThey are generally used in nephrogenic DI. Option D: Triamterene is also a potassium-sparing diuretic that can be used to treat nephrogenic \nDI. Note: Patients with DI usually do not develop overt signs of dehydration due to increased intake \nof water to compensate for polyuria. But when water intake is impaired they can present with \ndehydration.",

      "question": "Question 2: A patient having polyuria and polydipsia is diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. He is \nstarted on intranasal desmopressin. Which of the following is not a reason for choosing this \nover intravenous vasopressin?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Higher potency",
        "b": "Higher selectivity for V1 receptor",
        "c": "Has lower vasoconstrictor activity",
        "d": "Longer acting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Desmopressin is preferred in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus as it is a selective agonist \nof the V2 receptor. Desmopressin has minimal or no action on V1 receptors resulting in little vasoconstrictor activity. \nIt is more potent than vasopressin. It is longer acting than vasopressin as enzymatic degradation \nof desmopressin is slow. Lypressin acts on both V1 and V2 receptors. Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analog that has \nmore selectivity for the V1 receptor and produces fewer adverse effects than lypressin.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Furosemide is not used for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. It is a loop diuretic that might \nfurther worsen diabetes insipidus. Option A: The drug of choice for central diabetes insipidus is desmopressin. Desmopressin is a V2 \nreceptor agonist and synthetic analog vasopressin. Option C: Chlorpropamide enhances the action of circulating vasopressin and reduces urine \nformation in central DI. 255 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Carbamazepine also reduces urine formation in central DI. The exact mechanism is \nunknown.",

      "options": {
        "a": "A 50-year-old man with central DI post meningitis",
        "b": "A 25-year-old woman on lithium therapy with nephrogenic DI",

        "d": "A 7-year-old child with primary nocturnal enuresis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Tachyphylaxis refers to the rapid development of tolerance when doses of a drug are repeated in \nquick succession. It is a concern when desmopressin is used in bleeding disorders because \nlong-term use of desmopressin can cause depletion of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor \nstores. The usefulness of desmopressin in bleeding disorders is limited to preoperative preparation, \npostoperative bleeding, excessive menstrual bleeding, and emergency situations. In patients with \ntype I von Willebrand disease and in some with type IIn vWD, desmopressin elevates von \nWillebrand factor and shortens the bleeding time. Option A: It does not cause tachyphylaxis in central DI. Option B: Desmopressin is not indicated in nephrogenic DI. Option D: Bedtime administration of desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis provides a \nhigh response rate that is sustained with long-term use. However, intranasal desmopressin is no \nlonger recommended for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis because of the increased \nrisk of hyponatremia.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) \nwhich can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome of small cancer of the lung. Desmopressin is not \nused in the treatment of SIADH. Since excess vasopressin is the cause for SIADH, giving a vasopressin analog like desmopressin \nwould only worsen the condition. Management of SIADH: • Fluid restriction • Hypertonic saline( 3%) + loop diuretics is the treatment of choice in severe symptomatic \nhyponatremia. • Tolvaptan and conivaptan (vasopressin receptor antagonists) are preferred for long-term use. • Demeclocycline (a tetracycline drug) is used as an alternative.",

      "explanation": "The best approach in the treatment of chronic SIADH is the oral administration of \na vaptan like tolvaptan, which is a selective V2 receptor antagonist. This increases urinary water 256 \nSold by @itachibot excretion by blocking the antidiuretic effect of AVP. Other treatment options for chronic SIADH include: • Fluid intake &lt; 500 ml/day • Demeclocycline • Fludrocortisone Increased thirst is a frequently observed characteristic of hyponatremia in SIADH. Fluid \nrestriction is usually a burden to the patient. It is unreliable, impractical, and slow to work. As \nthirst is particularly difficult to suppress, water restriction in SIADH frequently leads to \nnon-compliance in the long run. Vaptans would be especially suited for the treatment of these \npatients. Serum sodium concentrations are also corrected by vaptans and hence, vaptans \nsubstantially improve the quality of life in these patients.",

Hence, the patient \nmay present with dry mouth and increased thirst. 257 \nSold by @itachibot Tolvaptan is a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. Decreased binding of vasopressin to the V2 \nreceptor in the kidney lowers the adenyl cyclase activity leading to decreased intracellular cAMP. \nDecreased cAMP concentrations prevent the fusion of aquaporin 2 containing vesicles with the \nplasma membrane, leading to an increase in urinary water excretion (free water clearance), and a \ndecrease in urine osmolality. The common side effects of tolvaptan include: • dehydration • hypernatremia • hypovolemia • liver injury Tolvaptan is used to delay disease progression in patients with ADPKD. 258 \nSold by @itachibot Sedatives and Hypnotics",
