      "explanation": "The given lab values in a CKD patient are suggestive of renal failure and remifentanil can be safely \nused in renal failure patients. Remifentanil is hydrolyzed by plasma and tissue esterases. The pharmacokinetics and the \npharmacodynamics of remifentanil are not altered by renal dysfunction. Option A: Pethidine is metabolized to norpethidine, accumulation of which can lead to CNS \nexcitatory effects (seizures). Option C: High levels of alfentanil can lead to prolonged action. Option D: Morphine is metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide which can accumulate leading to \nrespiratory depression.

Management of wooden chest syndrome: • Discontinuation of the opioid • Replacement of the opioid with a non-lipophilic version (such as hydromorphone or morphine) \nfor analgesia • Consider naloxone for reversal (you do not want to reverse analgesia on an intubated patient \nunless absolutely necessary) • Addition of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker for paralysis • Supportive ventilatory care",

      "question": "Question 25: An elderly man with bone metastasis is receiving intravenous opioids for pain management. \nWhich of the following drugs can be safely administered to him without a risk of developing \nrespiratory depression?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Morphine",
        "b": "Buprenorphine",
        "c": "Fentanyl",
        "d": "Alfentanyl"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Buprenorphine can be safely administered to this patient because of its ceiling effect on \nrespiratory depression. Ceiling effect is defined as no further increase in the effect of the drug with a further increment in \ndose, once the ceiling level is reached. Opioid agonist-antagonist compounds produce respiratory depression (and analgesia) with a \nceiling effect which means increasing the dose further does not produce any further respiratory \ndepression and may actually result in increased ventilation (due to the predominance of \nantagonist actions). Other drugs that show the ceiling effect are: • Butorphanol • Nalbuphine • Pentazocine. Respiratory depression with morphine, fentanyl &amp; alfentanyl does not have a ceiling effect \nbecause they are pure opioid agonists. As the dose increases, respiratory depression also increases \nprogressing to respiratory arrest. 386 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Butorphanol is an agonist at  receptor. It may be a partial agonist or antagonist at µ receptor. Pentazocine, butorphanol, buprenorphine, meptazinol, nalorphine, nalbuphine, and dezocine are \nmixed agonist-antagonist opioids. All opioid agonist-antagonists are µ antagonists and k agonists, except buprenorphine, \npentazocine, and dezocine. Buprenorphine, pentazocine, and dezocine are partial agonists at the  \nreceptor. Option A: Naltrexone is a pure antagonist at µ, k, and  receptors. Option B: Meperidine is a pure agonist of both  and  receptors. 387 \nSold by @itachibot Opioid Antagonists",
