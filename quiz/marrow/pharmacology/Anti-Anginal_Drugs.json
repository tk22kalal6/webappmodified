      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of nitrates in prinzmetal angina is endothelium-independent coronary \nvasodilatation. Prinzmetal angina occurs due to vasospasm of the coronary arteries. Nitrates relax the smooth \nmuscles of epicardial coronary arteries and relieve coronary artery spasm. In the case of stable angina, the primary mechanism of action of nitrates is preferential dilatation \nof veins (by increasing cGMP). Venous dilatation leads to a decrease in the venous return to the \nheart (preload). This decreases the ventricular end-diastolic volume and thereby a decrease in \nmyocardial oxygen consumption. The diastolic perfusion pressure (aortic blood pressure in \ndiastole - left ventricular pressure in diastole) is increased.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of sodium nitrite as an antidote for cyanide poisoning is by the \ndevelopment of methemoglobinemia. Cyanide binds to the cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) of the electron transport chain (ETC), \nthereby blocking it. When sodium nitrite is administered, it releases the nitrite ion. This ion binds \nto hemoglobin to form methemoglobin. The methemoglobin so formed, has a high affinity for the \ncyanide ion and binds to it, thus, detaching it from the cytochrome oxidase. This regenerates \nactive cytochrome normalizing the function of ETC. The cyanide ion with methemoglobin forms cyanmethemoglobin. Sodium thiosulphate is \nadministered for the elimination of this compound. The thiosulfate forms thiocyanate ion with \nthe cyanide and this is readily excreted.",
