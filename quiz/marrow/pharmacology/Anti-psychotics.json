      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Typical or first-generation antipsychotics primarily act by postsynaptic D2 receptor blockade. The second-generation or atypical antipsychotics mainly act by blocking 5HT2A receptors but they \nalso have weak D2 blocking effect. Histaminic H1 and muscarinic M1 receptors are blocked by most of the first and second \ngeneration agents. This contributes to sedation and anticholinergic effects of antipsychotics. Option C: Ropinirole and pramipexole are D2 agonists used in restless leg syndrome and \nParkinson's disease. Option D: Lorcaserin is a 5HT2C agonist that was used to treat obesity.

Amantadine increases the presynaptic release of dopamine and has agonist \nand modulatory action at postsynaptic D2 receptors. Option C: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic. Although this class of antipsychotics has a lower \nchance of causing NMS compared to typical antipsychotics, but cases of fatal NMS following the \nadministration of quetiapine have been recorded. Options B and D: Metoclopramide and domperidone are gastro kinetic agents with D2 \nantagonism.

Option A: Dopamine inhibits prolactin release causing hypoprolactinemia and \nhence antidopaminergic action of chlorpromazine causes hyperprolactinemia. Option B: Extrapyramidal side effects occur due to D2 antagonism in the nigrostriatal region.

Thus, agranulocytosis can happen at any plasma concentration of clozapine and \nconcentration &lt; 350 ng/mL does not lower the risk. Option A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which acts by blocking the 5HT2,  2 and D4 \nreceptors. The potency of block is D4 &gt; D2 &gt;D1. Option C: Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with clozapine is contraindicated \nbecause of the increased risk of leukopenia. In addition, carbamazepine is an enzyme inducer and \nreduces the half-life of clozapine. Option D: Administration of clozapine requires regular blood count monitoring due to the risk of \nagranulocytosis. Monitoring is performed weekly for the first 6 months and once in two weeks for \nthe next 6 months.

      "explanation": "The guidelines recommend continuing the same antipsychotic, as switching the drug during \npregnancy would cause a higher rate of relapse. Antipsychotic drugs and pregnancy: • Crossing the placenta: Olanzapine &gt; Haloperidol &gt; Risperidone &gt; Quetiapine. • Olanzapine is unlikely to increase the risk of birth defects above the background population risk. \nHowever, it can cause low birth weight and increased NICU admissions. • Clozapine is associated with gestational diabetes and neonatal seizures. Note: Although antipsychotic drugs appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy, the available data \ndoes not provide adequate guidance on the choice of agent. Because of limited experience in \nhumans, olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only when the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the fetus. 318 \nSold by @itachibot Anti-manic Drugs",
