      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of metoclopramide is primarily D2 antagonism in the chemoreceptor \ntrigger zone. Metoclopramide has the following actions: 828 \nSold by @itachibot • 5HT4 receptor agonism - prokinetic action • 5HT3 receptor antagonism - anti-emetic action at higher doses • Peripheral D2 antagonism - prokinetic action • Sensitization of muscarinic receptors on smooth muscles",

        "d": "Enhances gastrointestinal motility"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Metoclopramide enhances gastrointestinal motility. Acetylcholine increases gastrointestinal motility and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone. \nDopamine which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter suppresses ACh release. This decreases \ngastrointestinal motility and LES tone. Therefore, D2 receptor inhibition augments ACh release \nand enhances GI motility and LES tone. The action of metoclopramide is generally confined to the upper digestive tract and an increase in \ncolonic motility is clinically insignificant.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes the adverse effects characteristic of metoclopramide. The \nmost common adverse effects of metoclopramide involve the central nervous system because it \ncrosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blocks the central D2 receptors. The adverse effects include: • Restlessness • Drowsiness • Insomnia • Anxiety • Agitation • Extrapyramidal effects - acute reaction with high doses and long-term therapy. (due to central \ndopamine receptor blockade) • Dystonias • Akathisia • Parkinsonian features • Tardive dyskinesia Adverse events are more common among the elderly.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, the most effective antiemetic for chemotherapy-induced vomiting is \ngranisetron. Granisetron is a 5HT3 receptor antagonist. They are the most effective drugs for the treatment of \nchemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is a second-generation 5HT3 antagonist that has the highest affinity for 5HT3 \nreceptors and has the maximum potency. It is also the longest acting that makes it effective in \ndelayed emesis associated with chemotherapy. Palonosetron has minimal/no propensity to cause \nQT interval prolongation.",

      "explanation": "Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-HT3 antagonist and has minimal/no propensity to cause \nQT prolongation. First-generation 5-HT3 antagonists have an increased risk of QT interval prolongation. Intravenous dolasetron is contraindicated for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and \nvomiting for the same reason.",
