      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Lithium is a mood stabilizer with an antisuicidal role. Maintenance treatment with lithium has shown to decrease the rate of suicide in mood disorders. \nLithium was found to be better than other mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, \nand valproate. Lithium is also used in recurrent depression with a cyclic pattern is controlled by either lithium or \nimipramine. It is also used to augment standard antidepressant response in acute major \ndepression in those patients who have had an inadequate response to monotherapy.",

He believes he owns the biggest \nautomobile company in the world and talks about how his made-up company will put \nsatellites into space someday. She also says that he sleeps for only 3 hours a day. Which of the \nfollowing drugs cannot be used to treat this patient?",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical features given are suggestive of acute mania in this patient and lamotrigine is not \nindicated in this condition. It requires a slow, extended titration to minimize the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and is \nused for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder. Lithium, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and atypical antipsychotics are indicated in acute \nmania. Lithium is indicated in both acute mania and maintenance therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Prolonged use of lithium causes a benign and reversible flattening of T-wave. Option A: Lithium is usually not given alone in acute episodes as the onset of antimanic action is \nslow. Benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, or atypical antipsychotics are administered along with \nlithium in the early phases of treatment. Option B: Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index and monitoring of serum concentration is \nused for guiding dose adjustment. Option D: Lithium causes significant weight gain.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Clinical features are suggestive of lithium toxicity, where serum levels &gt;1.5 mEq/L are \nconsidered toxic. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (0.8–1.2 mEq/L) and therefore requires monitoring to \nsuspect toxicity. The toxic effects of lithium usually start manifesting when the serum level crosses \n1.5 mEq/L. Acute intoxication is characterized by: • Vomiting • Profuse diarrhea • Coarse tremors • Ataxia • Coma • Convulsions. A fine action tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses and can develop at \nany time during treatment. Therapeutic lithium tremor is generally symmetric, limited to the \narms, and nonprogressive.Tremor from lithium toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also \naffect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity. Serious effects of lithium toxicity will involve confusion, hyperreflexia, and seizures. Motor and \ncognitive side effects can become irreversible with persistent cerebellar tremor being the most \ncommon.",

      "explanation": "In acute overdoses, hemodialysis is indicated in: • Serum lithium level is &gt; 4.0 mEq/L • Patients exhibiting symptoms of toxicity. Note: While hemodialysis is considered when serum lithium level is 4.0 mEq/L and above, signs of \nlithium toxicity usually start showing when the serum level is &gt; 1.5 mEq/L.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In acute mania, even in patients without overt psychotic manifestations, atypical antipsychotics \nlike olanzapine is used initially for rapid control of psychosis. Atypical antipsychotics are also \neffective as monotherapy. The therapeutic effects of lithium, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are seen only after a few \ndays. Therefore they are effective only with daily dosing with adequate serum monitoring.",

Options A and B: Ataxia, slurred speech, and/or incoordination are adverse effects seen during \npeak CNS/serum concentrations. Single bedtime dosing can avoid these adverse effects.

Amiloride is the drug of choice for this condition. 326 \nSold by @itachibot Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It inhibits the renal epithelial Na+ channel (ENac \nchannel) in collecting duct cells. It blocks the entry of Li+ ions through the ENac channels and \nthus mitigates diabetes insipidus induced by lithium. Thiazide diuretics cause significant reductions in Li+ clearance that result in toxic \nlevels. Thiazides are contraindicated in patients who are on lithium therapy.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical features given in the question are most likely suggestive of lithium toxicity, and hence \nserum lithium levels should be measured to confirm it. Lithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index and is the first line of \nmanagement in bipolar disorder. The kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way via ENac channel. Thus during \nfasting/dehydration, along with Na+ reabsorption in renal tubules, there will be an increase in \nthe reabsorption of lithium leading to lithium toxicity. Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. The severity of lithium toxicity is \noften divided into the following three grades: A fine tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses. Therapeutic lithium \ntremor is generally symmetric, limited to the arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithium \ntoxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of \ntoxicity. Other adverse effects include mental confusion, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes \ninsipidus, and edema. As lithium is readily dialyzed, lithium overdose or toxicity is treated with hemodialysis. *Note - Serum Na+ levels are significant with respect to lithium toxicity, where as serum \npotassium levels becomes significant in digoxin toxicity. Hypokalemia increases the risk of \ndigoxin toxicity. Grade \nSr. lithium concentration(in \nmEq/L) Symptoms Mild symptoms \n1.5-2.5 \nnausea, vomiting,tremor, and fatigue 2.5-3.5 \nconfusion, agitation, delirium, Moderate intoxicatio \nn tachycardia, and hypertonia Severe intoxication \n>3.5 \ncoma,seizures, hyperthermia, and hypotension",
