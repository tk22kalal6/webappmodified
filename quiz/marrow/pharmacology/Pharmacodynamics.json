The therapeutic index (TI) describes a relationship between the doses of a drug that causes lethal \nor toxic effects with the dose that causes therapeutic effects. It is also called the therapeutic ratio. Mathematically, you can calculate TI by following way: Therapeutic Index = LD50/ED50 (or) Therapeutic Index = TD50/ED50 Where, • LD50 (Median Lethal dose) is the minimum amount of drug that causes adverse effects in 50% \nof the population. LD50 could also be replaced with Toxic dose (TD50). • ED50 (Median Effective dose) is the quantity of a drug that can produce desired therapeutic \neffects in 50% of the population.",

Option D: Median toxic dose is the dose required to produce a toxic effect in 50% of animals \ntested. Lethal dose is the dose required to kill 50% of animals tested.",
