      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The spinal component of opioid analgesia is seen due to the action in the dorsal horn of the spinal \ncord. Opioid analgesia: • Spinal component: opioids act in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn to inhibit the \nrelease of excitatory transmitters like substance P from primary afferents carrying pain \nimpulses. This action is through interneurons that are involved in the gating of pain impulses. • Supraspinal component: action at the medulla, periaqueductal gray matter, limbic, and cortical \nareas alter the processing and interpretation of pain impulses. It also sends inhibitory impulses \nthrough descending pathways to the spinal cord. • Peripheral action: acts on small primary afferent terminals in the skin or deeper structures, \ndecreasing their sensitization following tissue injury.",

Option B: Symptoms such as pruritus, nausea, and vomiting are also common with the epidural \nroute. Option D: Respiratory depression is seen with epidural opioids but the incidence is lesser than the \nparenteral route. 365 \nSold by @itachibot",
