      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Thyroid hormone receptors belong to the class of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that are activated by \nvarious lipid-soluble signals, including retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and steroid hormones. \nThey primarily function as transcription factors and directly interact with the genomic DNA to \nregulate gene expression. Nuclear receptors can either remain anchored in the cytoplasm via chaperone proteins until freed \nby ligand-binding (e.g., steroid and vitamin D receptors) or can reside in the nucleus bound to \nspecific DNA response elements even in the absence of ligand (e.g., thyroid hormone, PPAR, and \nretinoic acid receptors).",

      "question": "Question 3: A 23-year-old hypothyroid patient taking levothyroxine regularly has now become pregnant. \nWhat would your advice be regarding levothyroxine?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Switch to liothyronine as levothyroxine is teratogenic",
        "b": "Increase the dose as pregnancy causes an increased demand for levothyroxine",
        "c": "Continue the same dose but monitor the serum levels on a fortnightly basis",
        "d": "Stop levothyroxine till the end of the first trimester as it has teratogenic potential"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The dose of levothyroxine in patients who become pregnant should usually be increased. This is \nbecause demand for levothyroxine increases in pregnancy and low thyroxine levels are associated \nwith adverse fetal outcomes such as mental retardation. The dose of levothyroxine is increased by 30-50% by asking the patient to take 2 extra pills per \nweek. Increased demand for levothyroxine in pregnancy is due to: • The increased serum concentration of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) induced by estrogen • Increased expression of type 3 deiodinase in the placenta • A small amount of passage of levothyroxine to the fetus Thyroid hormones are not teratogenic. Liothyronine is not preferred in pregnancy because T3 has \na short half-life and requires frequent dosing to limit large fluctuations in levels. In addition, \nexcess T3 often acts to normalize TSH while lowering T4, thereby risking inadequate T4 \navailability to the fetus.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Patients who start estrogen therapy will need to increase their thyroid supplementation doses. Estrogens raise the circulating levels of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thereby increasing the \nbound fraction and decreasing the free (bioactive) fraction of circulating thyroxine (T4). As a \nconsequence, estrogen therapy increases the T4 supplementation requirements of women being \ntreated for primary hypothyroidism. Drugs increasing TBG levels: • Estrogens • Tamoxifen • Methadone • 5-fluorouracil Drugs decreasing TBG levels: 615 \nSold by @itachibot • Androgens • Corticosteroids • Niacin Drugs decreasing binding of T4 to TBG (by displacement): • Salicylates (aspirin, mefenamic acid) • Heparin • Furosemide",

      "explanation": "This patient is suffering from agranulocytosis which is a serious adverse effect that can be seen \nwith the use of either methimazole or propylthiouracil. Agranulocytosis usually occurs in the initial weeks or months of therapy. It occurs rapidly and \nperiodic monitoring of granulocyte levels is generally ineffective. However, it is reversible on discontinuation of the drug. Therefore, patients who are on these \ndrugs should be instructed to report immediately if they develop fever or sore throat.",

Type I deiodinase (D1) and type II deiodinase (D2) convert T4 to T3. Type III (D3) is \ninvolved in the conversion of T4 to reverse T3.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Graves disease and the drug of choice is methimazole. Option A: Methimazole is preferred over propylthiouracil due to fewer side effects and single-daily \ndosing (compared to PTU which is given TID). Option C: Levothyroxine is used in hypothyroidism. Option D: Lugol's iodine is a thyroid hormone-release inhibitor but not used as a first-line drug.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The drug of choice for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis during the first trimester of pregnancy is \npropylthiouracil (PTU). It is because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole or \nmethimazole. Carbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as: • Aplasia cutis congenita • Choanal atresia • Treacheosopageal fistula • Fetal goiter However, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It \nis replaced with carbimazole or methimazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of the pregnancy. The lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation. This is to \nmaintain the maternal serum-free T4 level in the upper limit of the non-pregnant normal \nreference range. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is best described as iodine-induced hypothyroidism. It is a normal, protective downregulation of thyroid hormone synthesis and release via transient \ninhibition of iodide organification in the presence of an iodine load (exogenous supplementation, \niodinated contrast dye, drugs like amiodarone). This occurs in the thyroid gland which is under \npituitary control. With persistent high iodine load, an escape phenomenon occurs in normal individuals after \naround 10 days as the iodide levels fall inside the follicle. In autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto’s or \nGrave’s), however, the suppression may persist. 617 \nSold by @itachibot The Jod-Basedow phenomenon is iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. It is also seen after an iodine \nload. However, it is seen in thyroid glands where autoregulation and pituitary control have failed. \nWhen exposed to an iodine load in excess, instead of blocking the organification process, the \nthyroid gland (areas of the autonomously functioning gland) continues to uptake the iodine, \nproducing more thyroid hormone independent of normal regulatory mechanisms. It is seen in \nendemic goiter, toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, and sometimes in Grave’s disease.",
