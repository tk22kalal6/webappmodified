        "d": "Lipoxygenase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Aspirin at low doses (75mg) primarily acts by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1). Low-dose aspirin, used for antiplatelet action, results in selective inhibition of platelet COX-1 \n(thromboxane synthase) inhibiting its ability to form thromboxane A2 (needed for platelet \naggregation). As platelets lack nuclei, new platelets have to be formed (life span of 7-10 days) for the return of \nCOX-1 activity. At higher doses (~1g/day), aspirin also inhibits COX-2 and results in decreased production of \nprostacyclin from endothelium. This may nullify the beneficial anti-aggregatory effect of aspirin. 744 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Clopidogrel acts by irreversible inhibition of P2Y12 receptors of the platelets. Options B and C: The onset of action is slow (starts after 4 hours) as it requires metabolic \nactivation by the hepatic CYP2C19 enzyme. Patients with a loss of function mutation of \nthe CYP2C19 allele exhibit reduced platelet inhibition and experience a higher rate of \ncardiovascular events. Option D: Due to irreversible inhibition of platelet P2Y12 receptors the duration of action is long \nand lasts for 5-7 days.",

      "explanation": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is converted into an active metabolite by the CYP2C19 enzyme \nand omeprazole can reduce the efficacy of clopidogrel due to its CYP2C19 inhibitory activity. Option B: Prasugrel is converted to its active metabolite mainly by other CYP enzymes and \ntherefore omeprazole does not interfere in its activation. Option C: Ticagrelor does not require activation and is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Option D: Vorapaxar is a thrombin receptor antagonist that is also metabolized by the CYP3A4 \nenzyme.",

Since the drug does \nnot require hepatic activation, it can be used in patients with CYP2C19 mutations.
