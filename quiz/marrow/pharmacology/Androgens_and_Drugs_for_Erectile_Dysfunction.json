      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Aromatase (CYP19) converts testosterone to estradiol. Certain effects of testosterone are mediated \nby estradiol. In men with deficient CYP19 or ER receptors, the epiphyses do not fuse, the long bones grow \nindefinitely and such patients are osteoporotic. Administration of estradiol can correct the bone \nabnormalities in CYP19 deficiency. However, this cannot be used in those with ER receptor \ndefects. Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5-alpha-reductase. Androstanedione and epiandrosterone are metabolites of DHT due to the action of 17-beta-HSD.",

      "question": "Question 3: A 59-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer is started on flutamide therapy. What is \nthe mechanism of action of this drug?",
      "options": {
        "a": "5-alpha reductase inhibitor",

        "c": "Competitive androgen receptor inhibitor",
        "d": "Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Flutamide acts by competitive inhibition of androgen receptors and is used to treat prostate \ncancer. Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen that competes with androgens such as testosterone and \ndihydrotestosterone for binding to the androgen receptors in the prostate gland. By doing so, it \nprevents them from stimulating the prostate cancer cells to grow. In addition to its use in prostate cancer, flutamide has been used to treat hyperandrogenism \n(excess androgen levels) in women, such as in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 691 \nSold by @itachibot Hirsutism. Other anti-androgens are: • Bicalutamide, apalutamide, and nilutamide • Spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist with antiandrogen activity) • Cyproterone acetate (progestin with antiandrogen activity) • Cimetidine (H2 blocker with anti-androgen activity) Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands that \nhave similar anabolic properties to anabolic steroids, but with reduced androgenic side effects. \nThere are no FDA-approved SARMs at present.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Finasteride is a competitive inhibitor of 5  -reductase enzyme and thereby inhibits the conversion \nof testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Finasteride selectively inhibits the Type 2 isoenzyme of 5 -reductase. It is indicated for use in: • Benign prostatic hyperplasia • Male pattern baldness • Hirsutism.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Gossypol is a non-steroidal agent that inhibits spermatogenesis. Gossypol is obtained from cottonseed. It inhibits spermatogenesis by exerting toxic effects on \nseminiferous tubules but has low efficacy. Libido and potency are not significantly affected and \nfertility usually returns after a few months of discontinuation of the drug. But, around 10% of the \npatients may remain infertile. Hypokalemia is a major adverse effect and may even lead to \ntransient paralysis. Low efficacy and significant toxicity have caused gossypol to be abandoned as a candidate male \ncontraceptive.",

        "d": "Tadalafil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Tadalafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with erectile dysfunction. Penile erection is mediated by NO and cGMP. During arousal, the corpus cavernosum produces \nnitric oxide which in turn stimulates the formation of cGMP. This leads to relaxation of the \nsmooth muscle of corpus cavernosum and penile arteries, causing engorgement of corpus \ncavernosum producing an erection. The biological actions of cGMP are terminated by 692 \nSold by @itachibot phosphodiesterase enzymes and PDE-5 is the major cGMP metabolizing enzyme in the penile \ntissue. Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors include: • Sildenafil • Tadalafil - Longest acting (24-36 hrs), bioavailability is not affected by food • Vardenafil • Avanafil - Most Rapid-acting (within 15 -30 mins) Option A: Podofilox topical cream is used in the treatment of genital warts and molluscum \ncontagiosum lesions. Option B: Finasteride is a 5  -reductase inhibitor. Option C: Apalutamide is a androgen receptor antagonist.",

        "d": "Phosphodiesterase 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Visual disturbance seen with sildenafil is due to PDE-6 inhibition. Sildenafil is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction principally due to its inhibitory actions \non PDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase 5) in the vascular tissues of the corpus cavernosa. However, it also \nexerts minor inhibitory action against PDE-6, which is present exclusively in rod and cone \nphotoreceptors and results in blurring and blue-green tinting of vision. Tadalafil and avanafil have better PDE-5/PDE-6 selectivity, compared to sildenafil and vardenafil \nand hence have lesser visual side effects.",

      "explanation": "Phenylephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of low flow priapism. Characteristics of low-flow priapism include painful rigid erection and ischemic corpora, indicated \nby dark blood upon corporeal aspiration. Prazosin, and, phenoxybenzamine are alpha-blockers that cause vasodilation and can worsen \npriapism. 693 \nSold by @itachibot",

Testosterone and its derivatives are used for their anabolic effects but they have significant \nandrogenic action. Some of them (17 methyl derivatives) are also hepatotoxic. The current \nconsensus is to advise against the use of such anabolic steroids. 694 \nSold by @itachibot Drugs Acting on Uterus",
