      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) protect against ovarian cancer. This benefit is thought to be due to the prolonged suppression of gonadotropin stimulation of the \novary on long-term use of OCPs. Other benefits of oral contraceptive pills: • Lesser incidence of endometrial carcinoma due to progestin component in OCP • Regularisation of menstrual cycles results in relief of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia • Reduced incidence of fibrocystic breast disease and ovarian cysts • Endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease are improved Option A: The estrogen component of combined oral contraceptive pills is mainly responsible for \nvenous thromboembolism. Option C: OCP is not used in the treatment of mastalgia. Mastalgia, chloasma, and breakthrough \nbleeding are known side effects of oral contraceptive pills. Option D: OCPs are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes. Rifampicin is a strong inducer of CYP3A4. \nHence, if administered together, rifampicin can cause enhanced metabolism of OCPs and may \nlead to contraceptive failure.",

Missed dose considerations for oral combined contraceptive pills: • If a single dose is missed - a double dose can be taken on the next day to make up for the missed \ndose. • If two or more doses are missed on subsequent days - the last missed pill has to be taken along \nwith the present pill and alternative methods of contraceptive must be used for the next 7 days. • If the pills were missed on the last week (days 15-21) - omit the hormone-free interval by \nfinishing the hormonal pills in the current pack and starting the new pack from the next day.",

All the following actions contribute to the contraceptive action of progestin-only pills: • The effectiveness of this drug is largely due to the thickening of cervical mucus which in turn \nimpair sperm penetration. • Inhibits ovulation via exerting negative feedback on the hypothalamus (GnRH). This leads to the \nabsence of the FSH and LH surge, which is essential to mature the dominant follicle and trigger \novulation. • Interfere with the implantation of a zygote by altering the endometrial environment. The major reason women discontinue the use of progestin-only contraceptives is breakthrough \nbleeding.",

It is commonly seen in hyperestrogenic states such as pregnancy and in those taking \nestrogen-containing contraceptives. It can also be seen in male patients with cirrhosis due to the \ndecreased ability of the liver to metabolize circulating estrogens, specifically estrone, which \nderives from the androgen androstenedione. Estrogens cause blood vessels to enlarge and dilate.",

      "explanation": "This is a case of gynecomastia which can occur as an adverse effect of spironolactone or \nketoconazole or chlorpromazine. Spironolactone - decreases testosterone production, increases peripheral conversion of \ntestosterone to estradiol, and displaces estradiol from their plasma-protein-binding sites Ketoconazole - decreases testosterone production and displaces testosterone from their binding \nsites Chlorpromazine (neuroleptics) - increase prolactin release by blocking the inhibitory action of \ndopamine on prolactin Clomiphene and tamoxifen are used mainly in reducing male gynecomastia. 687 \nSold by @itachibot Androgens and Drugs for Erectile Dysfunction",
