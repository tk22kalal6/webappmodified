Mechanism of action of aminoglycosides: • Aminoglycosides are transported actively across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm \n(oxygen-dependent process) • Binding of aminoglycosides to 30S ribosomes cause misreading of mRNA template and result in \nincorporation of incorrect amino acids in the growing polypeptide chain • The resulting aberrant proteins may be inserted into the cell membrane leading to altered \npermeability of the cell membrane of bacteria causing bacterial death (bactericidal)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Single daily dose aminoglycoside administration is more preferable to multiple daily dose \nadministration because of the long post-antibiotic effect. For certain classes of drugs such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, its antimicrobial action is \ndependent on the peak concentration above MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). It is \nreferred to as concentration-dependent killing. High-dose, extended-interval dosing schemes take advantage of the concentration-dependent \nactivity of aminoglycosides to achieve maximal initial bacterial killing. And then because of the \npostantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides, good therapeutic response can be attained even when \nconcentrations fall below MIC for a substantial fraction of the dosing interval. Therefore, a single daily dose would be equal to or more effective than multiple 8 hourly \ndoses. This dosing strategy may also reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of these drugs. 456 \nSold by @itachibot Time-dependent killing is an effect seen when the antimicrobial action is dependent on the \nduration, the drug concentration remains above the MIC. Beta-lactams, macrolides, and \nvancomycin have this property.",

The inactivating enzymes are commonly acquired through conjugation and transfer of plasmids \ncontaining resistance genes. Causes of aminoglycoside resistance are: • Drug inactivation by enzymes • Increased drug efflux • Decreased permeability to the drug • Modifications of the 30S ribosomal subunit that interferes with binding of the aminoglycosides",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The dose of aminoglycosides is to be reduced in patients with renal failure (AKI) because \nclearance of the drug is reduced. Aminoglycosides undergo minimum metabolism and are primarily excreted almost entirely by \nglomerular filtration. Therefore, renal failure decreases the clearance of the drug. Because the \nincidence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity is likely related to the overall exposure to \naminoglycosides, it is critical to reduce the maintenance dose and dosing interval of these drugs in \npatients with impaired renal function. Option B: Renal clearances are increased and the half-life is reduced in cystic fibrosis patients \nnecessitating higher doses. Option C: Burn patients have a more rapid drug clearance probably due to increased drug loss \nthrough burnt tissue and require higher doses in them. Option D: Aminoglycoside dose adjustment is not required in liver disease 457 \nSold by @itachibot",
