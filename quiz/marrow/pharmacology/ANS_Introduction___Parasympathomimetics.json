The contraction of a muscle is achieved by a cycle of ACh binding and its \ndegradation. Depolarising neuromuscular blockers (such as suxamethonium) acts by binding to \nthe receptors much longer than ACh and causing a prolonged depolarization, resulting in an \neventual blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis. 87 \nSold by @itachibot AChE metabolizes ACh and plasma cholinesterase metabolizes suxamethonium (SCh). \nNeostigmine blocks both enzymes. By inhibiting AChE, neostigmine increases the ACh \nconcentration in the synaptic cleft. But this cannot reverse the block as the depolarized nerves are \nunresponsive to any stimuli during this period. However, the simultaneous inhibition of plasma \ncholinesterase decreases the degradation of SCh and therefore potentiates the neuromuscular \nblock of suxamethonium, resulting in prolonged muscle relaxation. Neostigmine can be used only as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade caused by \ncompetitive non-depolarising blockers such as vecuronium.",
