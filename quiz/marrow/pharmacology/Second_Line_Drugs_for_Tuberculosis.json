      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Cycloserine is not a hepatotoxic drug. The adverse effects of cycloserine are mainly neurological. Half of the patients on cycloserine (1g/day) experience neuropsychiatric symptoms. It ranges from \nheadaches to psychosis, seizures, and suicidal ideas. Therefore, cycloserine is contraindicated in \npatients with epilepsy. Ethionamide, rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide are hepatotoxic agents. They are either \ncontraindicated or used with extreme caution in hepatitis.",

      "question": "Question 2: A 24-year-old woman who was started on treatment for MDR-TB 6 months back, presented \nwith complaints of fatigue, amenorrhea, and constipation since the past 1 month. On \nexamination, a swelling was noticed on the anterior aspect of her neck. Her lab reports show \nraised TSH levels with low free T‹ and T4 levels. Which anti-tubercular drug is likely to cause \nthis adverse effect?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Streptomycin",
        "b": "Pyrazinamide",
        "c": "Cycloserine",
        "d": "Ethionamide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "578 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical features and lab reports are suggestive of hypothyroidism with goiter, which is a \nknown adverse effect of ethionamide. MDR-TB is treated with 2nd line agents that include ethionamide (ETH). ETH is not a first-line \nagent due to its gastrointestinal side effects. It is structurally related to thionamides \n(propylthiouracil and methimazole) and therefore causes hypothyroidism by preventing \norganification of iodine in thyroid hormone synthesis. Another antitubercular drug that can cause \nhypothyroidism is Para-amino salicylic acid (PAS). ETH/PAS-induced hypothyroidism should be treated with thyroxine replacement therapy, instead \nof changing the regimen. Thyroid function usually optimizes within 2 months after completing \nMDR therapy.",

      "question": "Question 3: What is the mechanism of anti-mycobacterial action of bedaquiline?",

        "a": "Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis",

        "d": "Inhibition of RNA synthesis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of anti-mycobacterial action of bedaquiline is by inhibition of ATP synthase. Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline that targets the subunit c of the ATP synthase of M. tuberculosis. \nThis leads to inhibition of the proton pump activity of the ATP synthase and causes a failure in the \nbacillary energy metabolism.",

      "question": "Question 4: 575 \nSold by @itachibot A 68-year-old man with hypertension was diagnosed with drug-resistant pulmonary TB. One \nweek after starting ATT he presented to the casualty following an episode of syncope. ECG \nshowed a corrected QT interval of 477ms, which is shown below. Which drug used in his \nanti-tubercular therapy is responsible for this adverse effect?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Clofazimine",
        "b": "Isoniazid",
        "c": "Bedaquiline",
        "d": "Para-amino salicylic acid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 477ms is suggestive of QTc \nprolongation which is an adverse effect associated with bedaquiline. In the ECG QTc (corrected QT interval= QT/RR) is 477ms. Normal QTc is about 440ms. Values \nof more than 440ms in males and 460ms in females are considered to be prolonged. QTc \nprolongation usually presents as syncope or cardiac arrest. Although QT prolongation can cause Torsades de pointes, no cases have been reported with \nbedaquiline. A 5-fold higher rate of death has been reported in patients on bedaquiline versus \nthose on placebo. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises caution when \nadministering this medication. Bedaquiline is contraindicated in the age group of &lt;18 years.",

        "a": "Inhibition of ATP synthase",

        "d": "Inhibition of alanine racemase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Delamanid acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis. Pretomanid and delamanid are bicyclic nitroimidazoles that act by inhibiting mycolic acid (a \ncomponent of the mycobacterial cell wall) and protein synthesis in the mycobacteria. Pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid was approved by FDA in 2019 for the \ntreatment of adult patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB and for patients who \nare treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to multidrug-resistant pulmonary \n(MDR) TB treatment. 579 \nSold by @itachibot In India, delamanid is only approved for the management of MDR-TB. Isoniazid also acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis. Other options: Option A: Bedaquiline acts by inhibition of ATP synthase. It is a diarylquinoline that targets \nthe subunit c of the ATP synthase of M. tuberculosis. This leads to inhibition of the proton pump \nactivity of the ATP synthase and causes a failure in the bacillary energy metabolism. Option C: Fluoroquinolones act by inhibition of DNA gyrase. They are used as second-line agents \nin the treatment of tuberculosis. Option D: Cycloserine is a D-alanine analogue used as a second-line drug for MDR-TB that acts \nby inhibition of alanine racemase. Alanine racemase converts •-alanine to D-alanine which is \nneeded for the mycobacterial cell wall.",

Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, may also be administered for prophylaxis. Rifabutin ‹00 mg \nonce daily is used for patients who are intolerant to macrolides.

Treatment for pulmonary MAC infection is triple-drug therapy with: • A rifamycin, like rifampicin or rifabutin (In HIV patients on ART, rifabutin is preferred) • Ethambutol 580 \nSold by @itachibot • A macrolide, like clarithromycin or azithromycin MAC infection is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, occurring predominantly at CD4+ T \ncell counts of &lt;50/• and high viral load.
