      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and investigations are suggestive of HSV encephalitis for which the \ndrug of choice is intravenous acyclovir. The treatment is effective only if it is started early. The clinical hallmark of HSV encephalitis is the acute onset of fever and focal neurologic signs \nwith hemorrhagic necrosis of especially the temporal lobe. The most sensitive investigation is \nHSV DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR.",

The other nucleoside congeners are \ncidofovir, ganciclovir, and famciclovir. 594 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, though rare and reversible, are dose-limiting side \neffects of acyclovir. Option C: Acyclovir has a low bioavailability which is overcome by administering valacyclovir, a \nprodrug with higher bioavailability. Mechanism of action of anti-viral drugs:",

Treatment should be started ideally within 24 hours of \nrash onset. Oral acyclovir (800 mg five times daily) is an alternative drug, but valacyclovir is preferred due to \nits higher bioavailability and less frequent dosing. In immunocompromised patients, varicella \ninfection is treated with IV acyclovir. Option A: Oseltamivir is used for the treatment of avian influenza. Option B: Ribavirin is used for treating RSV bronchiolitis. Option D: Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are approved for CMV retinitis.",

      "explanation": "Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor. Drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir competitively and reversibly interact with the enzyme sites \nto inhibit viral neuraminidase activity. This interferes with the release of the progeny from \ninfected host cells, halting the spread of infection. Early administration hastens the resolution of symptoms if given within 48 h of infection. \nOseltamivir is given at a dose of 75 mg, twice a day for 5 days for the treatment of influenza A and \nB.
