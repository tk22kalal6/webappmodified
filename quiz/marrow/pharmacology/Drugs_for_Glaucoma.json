      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. Beta-blockers reduce intra-ocular pressure primarily by \nreducing aqueous humor production. Another hypothesis states that by reducing ocular blood \nflow, there may be a decrease in ultrafiltration responsible for aqueous production. Netarsudil is a rho-kinase inhibitor that acts by increasing trabecular outflow. Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist that has a small effect on increasing both uveoscleral and \ntrabecular outflow. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin PGF2-alpha analog that primarily acts by releasing matrix \nmetalloproteinases, thereby increasing trabecular and uveoscleral outflow.",

Drugs having \nsignificant anticholinergic action should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients \nprone to developing acute angle-closure glaucoma. The anticholinergic action results in the relaxation of the sphincter pupillae muscle. This results in \nthe iris coming in contact with the lens and thereby obstructing the movement of the aqueous \nfrom the posterior to the anterior chamber.
