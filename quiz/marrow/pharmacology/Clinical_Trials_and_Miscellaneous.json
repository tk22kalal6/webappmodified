Orphan receptors are receptors that are discovered yet no known \nligands are identified. There are two types of drug development. They are: • Traditional drug development: Initial drug discovery is followed by the characterization of the \nreceptors the drugs are used to act on. • Contemporary drug development: Due to advances in molecular biology and genome \nsequencing, receptors are identified initially. The drugs are identified later using chemical \nscreening later resulting in the discovery of orphan receptors. Special incentives are given by the government to pharmaceutical companies for the development \nand marketing of orphan drugs. Few examples of orphan drugs are: • Liposomal amphotericin B • Digoxin antibody (Digibind) • Fomepizole",
