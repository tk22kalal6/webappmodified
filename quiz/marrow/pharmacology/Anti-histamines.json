      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "H3 histamine receptor is a presynaptic autoreceptor. H3 receptors are predominantly presynaptic and are present in basal ganglia, hippocampus, and \ncerebral cortex. They function as autoreceptors inhibiting histamine release from the neuron. H3 \nreceptors are also found postsynaptically but their function is not known.

      "question": "Question 2: Which of the following will not be seen on the administration of an H3 receptor agonist?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Inhibition of H1 receptor induced wakefulness",
        "b": "Increase in H2 mediated gastric secretion",
        "c": "Inhibition of H1 mediated bronchoconstriction",
        "d": "Negative chronotropic effect on atria"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "H3 receptor agonist decreases H2 mediated gastric secretion. H3 receptors are presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors on histaminergic neurons. H3 receptor \nagonists decrease the release of histamine and have actions similar to that of antihistamines. Normally, histamine increases gastric secretion by acting through the H2 receptor in the stomach. \nH3 receptor agonist decreases histamine release and hence, decreases \nH2 receptor-mediated gastric secretion. Options A and C: H1 receptor stimulation by histamine in the CNS causes wakefulness, and at \nthe bronchus causes bronchoconstriction. Therefore H3 receptor agonists by decreasing histamine \nrelease inhibit H1 receptor-induced wakefulness and bronchoconstriction. Option D: H3 receptors are also presynaptic heteroreceptors on various neurons and their \nactivation can decrease noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and glutaminergic \ntransmission. A decrease in noradrenergic transmission in atria can result in a negative \nchronotropic effect.",

      "question": "Question 3: You are about to prescribe an antihistamine to a patient with allergic rhinitis. You wish to \nprescribe a second-generation drug as they cause fewer side effects. Which of the following \nwill you not choose?",

      "explanation": "Clemastine is a first-generation antihistamine. H1 antagonists are classified into 2 generations: First-generation antihistamines - They have a strong sedative property and also \nhave an antimuscarinic function. They include: • Doxepin • Clemastine, Diphenhydramine, Dimenhydrinate • Promethazine • Pheniramine, Chlorpheniramine, Dexchlorpheniramine • Cyproheptadine • Hydroxyzine, Cyclizine, Meclizine, Buclizine, Cinnarizine Second-generation antihistamines - They are less sedative because of less central nervous system \npenetration and do not block autonomic receptors. They include: • Olopatadine • Fexofenadine, Loratadine, Desloratadine • Cetirizine, Levocetirizine • Azelastine • Mizolastine • Ebastine 735 \nSold by @itachibot • Rupatadine",

      "explanation": "The truck driver is suffering from allergic rhinitis and fexofenadine can be prescribed to him. This \nis preferred as it is a second-generation antihistamine having minimal/no sedative effects as it \ncannot cross the blood-brain barrier easily. Pheniramine, promethazine, and hydroxyzine are first-generation antihistamines which should \nnot be prescribed to drivers and heavy machine workers because they are lipophilic and cross the \nblood-brain barrier easily and cause sedation.

      "explanation": "The scenario points towards a diagnosis of drug-induced Parkinsonism due to long-term intake of \nhaloperidol. Promethazine is the preferred antihistamine as it has the strongest \nanticholinergic (muscarinic blocking) activity among the given options. Drug-induced Parkinsonism is caused by drugs that have D2 dopamine antagonistic action like \ntypical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). The decrease in dopaminergic activity results in an \nunbalanced cholinergic activity. Anticholinergics act by restoring balance. First-generation H1 antagonists have anticholinergic properties, while second-generation H1 \nantagonists do not have anticholinergic properties. H1 antagonists having high anticholinergic activity are as follows: • Promethazine • Diphenhydramine • Dimenhydrinate • Pheniramine",
