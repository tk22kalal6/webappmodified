      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of postural hypotension caused by prazosin. These symptoms can \nbe avoided by using silodosin which has a selective antagonist action on  1A receptors over  1B \nreceptors. The prostate stroma has a maximum concentration of  1A receptors over other  1 receptor \nsubtypes.  1B receptors are present on blood vessels which play a role in vasoconstriction. Hence, \nselective  1A receptor antagonists have minimal effect on blood pressure as compared to \nnon-selective  1 antagonists like prazosin.  1 receptor antagonists can be classified as: • Selective antagonists • Silodosin ( 1A) • Tamsulosin ( 1A +  1D) • Non-selective • Prazosin • Terazosin • Doxazosin • Alfuzosin",

It is an  -blocker that has more selectivity towards  1A/1D when compared to  1B receptors. The \nvasodilatory effects are mainly attributed to the blockade of  1B receptors present on blood \nvessels.

      "explanation": "Retrograde ejaculation is the main side effect of tamsulosin. It is a selective  1A/1D blocker and the relief of BPH symptoms is mainly due to blockade of  1A \nreceptors. Blockade of  1D receptors present in the bladder relaxes the urethral sphincter, which \nis normally closed during ejaculation.

Intracavernosal phentolamine ( -blocker) is used for the management of impotency. Priapism is a \nserious adverse effect of this agent.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Propranolol is generally avoided in diabetic patients because it masks the hypoglycaemic \nsymptoms. Non-selective  blockers interfere with the counter-regulatory hormones secreted during \nhypoglycemia, resulting in prolonged hypoglycemia. It also decreases the perception of symptoms \nsuch as tremors, tachycardia, and nervousness. These symptoms are manifested due to \nstimulation of sympathetic beta receptors in response to hypoglycemia. Blunting of sympathetic \nresponse results in hypoglycemic unawareness. Cardioselective beta-blockers have relatively lesser interference on the sympathetic response to \nhypoglycemia and are preferred in diabetic patients.",
