Option A: Although 65% of Na+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, diuretics acting here do not \nhave maximum efficacy. This is because the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle has a great \nreabsorptive capacity and it absorbs most of the filtrate from the proximal tubule. Options C and D: Diuretics acting distal to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle have \nlimited efficacy because most of the reabsorption of Na+ (&gt;90%) would have already occurred \nby the time the tubular fluid reaches there.",

ACE inhibitors decrease angiotensin II levels and thereby, decrease aldosterone levels. \nDecreased aldosterone level causes K+ retention by reducing the exchange. Therefore, ACE \ninhibitors cause retention of K+. Diuretics that cause elevation of plasma K+ levels are not suitable for combining with ACE \ninhibitors.
