      "question": "Question 1: A young man who collapsed at a concert was suspected to have bacterial meningitis. The \nother attendees of the concert were administered ciprofloxacin by the medical staff on duty. \nWhat is this kind of antimicrobial therapy called?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The antimicrobial treatment initiated in a patient who is not yet infected is called prophylactic \ntherapy. The goal is to prevent infection in some patients and to prevent dangerous \nmanifestations of infections in other patients. Option A: Preemptive therapy is therapy in an asymptomatic individual with evidence of infection \n(high-risk). 415 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Empirical therapy is broad-spectrum therapy in a patient with symptoms of infection \nbut no microbiological confirmation of the causative agent. Option D: Suppressive therapy is given to patients when the infection is controlled but not \ncompletely eradicated by the initial round of antimicrobial treatment. This is usually indicated for \nimmunosuppressed patients.",

      "question": "Question 2: The total microbial population was found to be susceptible to antimicrobials on testing but a \nsubset of the same population was resistant which was undetected. What is this phenomenon \ncalled?",

        "a": "Cross resistance",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Heteroresistance occurs when a subset of the total microbial population is resistant, despite the \ntotal microbial population being susceptible on testing. The resistant subpopulation is usually well \nbelow the assay-detection limits. Heteroresistant Staphylococci and M. tuberculosis have led to therapeutic failures and mortality. \nC. albicans and C. neoformans with heteroresistance to fluconazole have resulted in increased \ntreatment failures. Note: For viruses, the resistant viral species occurring due to the above phenomenon is termed as \n'quasi-species'. Quasi-species resistant to antiretroviral agents have resulted in the failure of \nantiretroviral therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent killing and are preferably dosed once daily for \nmaximum effect. Peak concentration above MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) matters for certain classes of \ndrugs for their antimicrobial action. It is referred to as concentration-dependent killing. The \nperiod during which the concentration remains above MIC is not relevant for such drugs. \nAminoglycosides and quinolones have this property. Time-dependent killing: The antimicrobial action is dependent on the period for which the \nconcentration of drug remains above the MIC. Penicillins, 5-fluorocytosine and vancomycin have \nthis property.",

      "explanation": "Multidrug resistance is transferred through conjugation.

The main mode of transfer of \nresistant gene-containing plasmids is through conjugation.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial drug that does not act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. The antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin appears to correlate with the rapid intracellular \nconversion of nitrofurantoin to highly reactive intermediates by bacterial reductases. These \nintermediates react nonspecifically with many ribosomal proteins and disrupt the synthesis of \nproteins, RNA, DNA, and metabolic processes. Carbapenems, monobactams, and cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics that act by inhibiting \ncell wall synthesis.",

      "explanation": "Bacitracin acts on the cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of the cell wall. It interferes with the dephosphorylation of bactoprenol (lipid carrier) which carries peptidoglycan \nsubunits outside the cell membrane to the growing cell wall. It can also alter the integrity of the \ncell membrane. Bacitracin is mainly active against gram-positive cocci and bacilli. 418 \nSold by @itachibot Antimalarial Drugs",
