      "explanation": "The most appropriate first-line antihypertensive among the given drugs is chlorthalidone. Thiazide diuretics are recommended as one of the first-line antihypertensive drugs for elderly \npatients without any comorbidities. Among them, guidelines recommend chlorthalidone over \nhydrochlorothiazide because of its longer duration of action. First-choice drugs used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without any comorbidities \ninclude: • ACE inhibitors or ARBs: No evidence of superiority of one class over the other. However, ACE \ninhibitors have a higher risk of side effects like dry cough and angioedema. • Calcium channel blockers: Extended-release, long-acting dihydropyridines are preferred. • Thiazide diuretics: Chlorthalidone is usually preferred to hydrochlorothiazide. Loop diuretics like furosemide and torsemide are less effective antihypertensives than thiazides. \nThey are not indicated for the routine management of hypertension. In the presence of any associated conditions or comorbidities, the first choice drugs for the \ntreatment of hypertension would be as follows: Comorbidities \nFirst choice drugs for hyperte \nnsion ACE inhibitors or ARBs DiabetesChronic kidney disea \nse with proteinuria Angina \nBeta-blockers or calcium cha \nnnel blockers Heart failure \nACE inhibitors and alpha+be \nta blockers (e.g., carvedilol) Benign prostatic hyperplasia \n 1 blockers Pregnancy \nLabetalol Atrial fibrillation \nDiltiazem or verapamil",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Thiazides act by increasing the tubular rabesorption of lithium. Thiazide use is accompanied by sodium loss which is compensated in a few days by increased \nreabsorption of Na+ in the proximal tubule. The kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way. Thus, along with Na+ reabsorption, \nthere will be an increase in the reabsorption of lithium also, resulting in decreased excretion of \nlithium.",

Option A: Beta-blockers can contribute to K+ retention by decreasing renin release and further \nreducing aldosterone secretion. Non-selective beta-blockers may also interfere with the cellular \nuptake of K+ ions.

      "explanation": "Long term reduction of blood pressure by thiazide diuretics is mainly due to a reduction in \nperipheral vascular resistance. Thiazide diuretics initially decrease extracellular volume by their action on NaCl transporter in \ndistal convoluted tubules in the nephrons. However, the compensatory response from activation \nof RAAS raises the extracellular volume returns almost to pre-treatment levels after a few weeks.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario of severe hypertension (blood pressure 180/120 mmHg) with fundoscopic \nchanges (flame haemorrhages and/or papilloedema) is suggestive of malignant hypertension. The \ndrug of choice is IV nicardipine which acts by calcium channel blockage. Nicardipine blocks the influx of extracellular calcium across the vascular and myocardial smooth \nmuscle cell membranes by blocking the voltage-sensitive calcium channels during depolarization. \nThe decrease in intracellular calcium causes dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries. Other preferred agents for malignant hypertension are clevidipine with labetalol or esmolol. Note: Sodium nitroprusside is no longer the treatment of choice for acute hypertensive problems 200 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Drug-induced lupus is not an adverse effect of sodium nitroprusside infusion. When nitroprusside is administered at a high rate, it can result in the production of \nmethemoglobin and cyanide. Cyanide is further metabolized to thiocyanate. On prolonged \ninfusion, thiocyanate toxicity can also occur especially in patients with renal failure.",

Gout is a metabolic disease associated with hyperuricemia.Thiazides increase direct urate \nreabsorption in the proximal renal tubules and are associated with elevated serum uric acid levels \nand may precipitate gout.

Within 30-90 minutes of the initial dose of prazosin or when the dosage is increased, there is \nmarked orthostatic hypotension or syncope. This is known as the first-dose phenomenon. After a \nfew initial doses, tolerance develops to this side effect. Initiating low doses at bedtime is \nrecommended to minimize this phenomenon.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Telmisartan can be given safely in a patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) because it is mainly \ncleared from circulation by biliary excretion. Options A and D: Sucralfate is a basic aluminum salt of sucrose sulfate. Sucralfate, aluminum \nhydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide in CRF patients can cause the accumulation of Al3+ and \nMg2+ ions as they are preferentially excreted via the kidney after systemic absorption. Absorbed \nAl3+ can contribute to osteoporosis, encephalopathy and proximal myopathy in CRF patients. Option B: Candesartan is cleared from circulation by renal and biliary excretion. Hence, plasma \nclearance is affected by renal insufficiency. 201 \nSold by @itachibot Diuretics",
