      "explanation": "LABA is used in combination with inhalational corticosteroids (ICS), preferably in the form of a \ncombination inhaler. LABA is never taken alone as it does not treat the underlying chronic inflammation of asthma. \nCorticosteroids will decrease the underlying inflammation and halt the progression of the disease.

        "d": "Systemic absorption of drugs is unaffected"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given image is of a spacer device. It decreases the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and \nother propellant-mediated oropharyngeal adverse effects like dysphonia that occur with the use of \na pMDI. Spacers reduce the velocity and size of particles entering the upper airways. This reduces the \namount of drug that impinges on the oropharynx and increases the proportion of drug inhaled \ninto lower airways. The systemic absorption is unchanged by the use of a spacer. Spacer devices are useful in delivering inhaled drugs to children who are not able to use a pMDI \nalone but can also be used by adults for better drug delivery. The image below shows the use of a \nspacer device with a face mask which is preferred in children younger than 3 years of age. The various devices used for the delivery of inhalational drugs are: • Pressurized metered-dose inhalers - Drugs are propelled from a canister in the pMDI with the \naid of a propellant. These devices are convenient, portable, and typically deliver 50–200 doses of a 794 \nSold by @itachibot drug • Dry powder inhalers - these devices scatter the drug into a fine powder that is dispersed by air \nturbulence on inhalation. DPIs have been developed to deliver drugs such as insulin, but the \ndosing is inconsistent. Children &lt;7 years find it difficult to use a DPI. • Nebulizers: Two types of nebulizer are available - • Jet nebulizers that are driven by a stream of gas (air or oxygen) • Ultrasonic nebulizers that use a rapidly vibrating piezoelectric crystal and thus do not require a \nsource of compressed gas. The nebulizers deliver much higher drug doses as compared pMDIs. These are useful in: • Treating acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD • Extreme airway obstruction (severe COPD) 795 \nSold by @itachibot • Delivering inhaled drugs to infants and small children who cannot use the other inhalation \ndevices • Administering drugs such as antibiotics in relatively high doses",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Theophylline has an antagonistic action on adenosine receptors. Theophylline is a methylxanthine. It acts as a non-selective PDE inhibitor. Its other actions \ninclude: • Increased IL-10 release • Decrease in gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines • Promotes apoptosis of granulocytes • Histone deacetylase activation. The recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 by glucocorticoid \nreceptors switches off inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism, theophylline enhances the \nanti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. Theophylline can be used as a bronchodilator in an asthmatic patient on ICS as an add-on drug. \nLABAs are more effective but theophylline is a cheaper option.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A decrease in dose of theophylline is required in cardiopulmonary disease. This is because \nreduced clearance of theophylline is seen in liver disease, pneumonia, and heart failure. In smokers, clearance of theophylline is increased due to the induction of CYP1A2 enzyme. 796 \nSold by @itachibot Theophylline is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that decreases the breakdown of \ncAMP levels in smooth muscles resulting in bronchodilation.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Theophylline is indicated in the treatment of apnea of prematurity. In apnea of prematurity, methylxanthines such as theophylline and caffeine increase the central \nrespiratory drive by lowering the threshold of response to hypercapnia. They also enhance the \ncontractility of the diaphragm and prevent diaphragmatic fatigue. Options A &amp; B - The adenosine receptor antagonism property of theophylline precipitates \ncardiac arrhythmias and epileptic seizures. Option C - Theophylline is no longer recommended as a treatment for acute severe asthma by the \nlatest guidelines (GINA 2021) because of its poor efficacy and safety profile.",

PDE-4 is the major isoform present in inflammatory cells and its inhibition results in higher \nanti-inflammatory effects. Option A: Seratrodast is a thromboxane receptor antagonist used in the prophylaxis of asthma. It \ndecreases the bronchial hypersensitivity caused by thromboxane. Option C: Zileuton is a lipoxygenase inhibitor that can be used in the treatment of asthma. Option D: Nedocromil is a mast cell stabilizer indicated in the prophylaxis of asthma.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Dextromethorphan, morphine, and gabapentin are all antitussives. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist that suppresses the cough center. Opiates like morphine have a central mechanism of action on the medullary cough center and are \nindicated for intractable cough associated with bronchial carcinoma. Gabapentin and pregabalin are GABA analogs that have been shown to benefit chronic idiopathic \ncough involving neural hypersensitivity. Guaifenesin is an expectorant that is taken orally. Carbocysteine is a mucolytic that reduces the disulfide bridges that bind glycoproteins to other \nproteins, such as albumin and secretory IgA. It is also taken orally and helps reduce the viscosity \nof sputum.",

Codeine is an opioid analgesic having specific antitussive action while dextromethorphan is a \ncentrally active NMDA receptor antagonist that may be effective as an antitussive. Both are \ncentrally acting antitussives, and do not provide any added advantage when combined. Hence it is \nan irrational drug combination. Rational fixed-dose combination drugs for the treatment of cough usually contain: • A centrally acting anti-tussive (either codeine or dextromethorphan; not both), with • Antihistamines, decongestants and expectorants. Option A - Both of these drugs carry a risk of addiction, but it is not the reason to not give the \ndrug. The main reason is that the combination is irrational. Options B &amp; D - Both codeine and dextromethorphan have different mechanisms of \naction and can treat cough effectively. However, the combination of two centrally acting \nantitussives does not provide any added advantage compared to using one drug alone. Hence, the \ncombination is irrational. 803 \nSold by @itachibot 804 \nSold by @itachibot Acid Peptic Disorders and Inflammatory Bowel Disease",
