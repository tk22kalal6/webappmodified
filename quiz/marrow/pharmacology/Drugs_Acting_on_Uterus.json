      "question": "Question 1: A patient is administered oxytocin as part of the active management of the third stage of \nlabor (AMTSL) protocol. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this drug?",
      "options": {
        "a": "It is responsible for galactokinesis",
        "b": "It can be given by oral route",
        "c": "It is secreted by anterior pituitary",
        "d": "At higher doses, it exerts diuretic like action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Oxytocin is responsible for galactokinesis (milk ejection reflex). Option B: It is a peptide and inactive orally. Option C: It is secreted by posterior pituitary along with vasopressin. Option D: At higher doses, it can exert vasopressin like action and cause water retention.",

        "c": "Pitocin",
        "d": "Orciprenaline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Orciprenaline is a beta 2 receptor agonist that has uterine relaxing property. Oxytocics are uterine stimulants that increase uterine motility, especially at term. Uterine stimulants are: • Posterior pituitary hormones - oxytocin/pitocin • Ergot derivatives - ergometrine, methylergometrine • Prostaglandins - PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and others • Others - quinine, ethacridine Ethacridine is used as an abortifacient.",

      "question": "Question 3: A 32-year-old multipara at 40 weeks gestation developed water intoxication and \nhyponatremia following prolonged IV infusion with oxytocin by an inexperienced junior \nresident. This adverse effect is due to oxytocin's action on which of the following sites?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Vasopressin V2 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "b": "Vasopressin V2 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "c": "Vasopressin V1 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells",
        "d": "Vasopressin V1 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Oxytocin can bind to V2 receptors on the serosal surface of renal tubular cells resulting in reduced \nfree water clearance. This is because oxytocin and vasopressin have structural similarities. Oxytocin can have \nvasopressin (ADH) like activity at V2 receptors. The increase in water permeability occurs through \nthe insertion of aquaporins (water channels) in collecting tubules. Prolonged i.v. administration at high doses in conjunction with large volumes of hypotonic fluid \nmay cause water intoxication associated with hyponatremia. 698 \nSold by @itachibot To avoid this complication, whenever high doses of oxytocin are administered over a long time: • An electrolyte-containing diluent must be used (not dextrose) • The volume of infused fluid should be kept low (by infusing oxytocin at a higher concentration) • Fluid intake must be restricted, fluid balance chart should be kept and serum electrolytes should \nbe monitored",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Spontaneous premature labor is not an indication for oxytocics. Infact, it is an indication for \ntocolytics. Uses of oxytocin are: • Induction of labor • Postpartum hemorrhage • Uterine inertia • Breast engorgement due to insufficient milk ejection reflex",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Carbetocin is a long-acting analog of oxytocin. It is indicated for the prevention of uterine atony following caesarian section and for prevention of \nPPH. Option A: Desamino-oxytocin is a buccal formulation of oxytocin that is similar to oxytocin \ninjection.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "699 \nSold by @itachibot Ergot derivatives are indicated for the prevention and/or treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Ergot alkaloids markedly increase the motor activity of the uterus. The capacity to induce \nsustained uterine tetany and fetal distress exclude their use in the initiation or facilitation of \nlabor. Due to the high incidence of postoperative vomiting and lack of evidence in reducing bleeding, \nroutine or prophylactic use of uterotonic medications at the time of MTP is not recommended. Ergot alkaloids used in PPH include ergometrine and methylergometrine.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Administration of Ergot alkaloids (such as methyl ergotamine) result in hypertension. The use of ergot alkaloids is preferably avoided in hypertensive patients. Adverse effects of ergometrine/methylergometrine are: • Nausea and vomiting • Hypertension • Decrease in pain threshold but analgesia might be required • Decrease in milk secretion postpartum (due to dopaminergic action especially at higher doses)",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Dopamine does not have any significant activity on the tone of the uterus, since uterine relaxation \nis mediated by beta-2 receptors.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Progesterone can be given prophylactically to reduce the risk of preterm labor. It inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and delays cervical ripening. Therefore, \nprogesterone and its derivatives have been advocated to diminish the onset of preterm labor in \nwomen at high risk due to previous preterm delivery. 700 \nSold by @itachibot Intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone administered weekly as well as vaginal administration has \nboth been shown to reduce the incidence of preterm delivery. Ritodrine, terbutaline, and nifedipine are tocolytics that are indicated for inhibition of uterine \ncontractions of preterm labor and not for prophylaxis against preterm labor. 701 \nSold by @itachibot NSAIDs",
