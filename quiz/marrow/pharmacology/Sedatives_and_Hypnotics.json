      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine. These are allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. They do \nnot directly activate GABAA receptors to open the Cl- channel. GABAA receptor is a transmembrane inhibitory receptor in the CNS that functions as a chloride \nion channel and has 5 subunits. Benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor that bind at the  / interface of \nthe receptor. This increases the affinity of the GABAA receptor for GABA thus increasing the 263 \nSold by @itachibot frequency of the opening of the channel. Barbiturates, on the other hand, have a different binding site to the receptor and they increase the \nduration of the GABA gated chloride channel opening.",

Option A: Ethanol releases GABA and also has a binding site on the GABA receptor chloride \nchannel complex. Option B: Alphaxolone is a neurosteroid and it acts through activation of GABAA receptors.

      "explanation": "The administration of barbiturates is contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria. The rate-limiting enzyme in porphyria synthesis is -aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)-synthetase. \nBarbiturates are enzyme inducers and they result in the increased synthesis of porphyrins and \nsubsequent precipitation of acute intermittent porphyria. Options A and C: Barbiturates are used to treat anxiety and refractory status epilepticus. Option D: Phenobarbitone can be used to treat kernicterus in newborns as it increases hepatic \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme activity and the conjugation of bilirubin. 266 \nSold by @itachibot",

The other melatonin agonists are: • Tasimelteon - used in insomnia in blind people • Agomelatine - used in major depressive disorder Option A: Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant and functions as a serotonin-norepinephrine \nreuptake inhibitor. It is used in depression, anxiety, and some forms of insomnia. Option B: Suvorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of insomnia. Option D: Trazodone is a mixed agonist and antagonist at various serotonin receptors used as an \nantidepressant and in alcohol dependence.",

      "explanation": "Diazepam and its long-acting metabolites can accumulate significantly in elderly patients with \nliver disease and therefore should not be used in such cases. Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine. It is metabolized in the liver to active metabolites like \nnordazepam which are long-acting. Nordazepam is further converted to oxazepam which is \nconjugated with glucuronic acid to form inactive metabolites. Lorazepam, oxazepam, and triazolam are also metabolized in the liver but do not form long-acting \nactive metabolites. As such, they can be used in elderly patients with liver disease but with \ncaution. Oxazepam and lorazepam are intermediate-acting and undergo glucuronide conjugation directly \nto form inactive metabolites. Triazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine. It forms alpha-hydroxy active metabolites but they are \nshort-acting and undergo glucuronide conjugation to form inactive metabolites. 268 \nSold by @itachibot Anti-epileptics I",
