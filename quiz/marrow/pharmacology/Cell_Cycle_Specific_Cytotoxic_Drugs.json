      "explanation": "The Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine, 2018 was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku \nHonjo for the discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors inhibit proteins that keep immune responses to cancer cells in \ncheck. When these proteins are blocked, the brake on the immune system is released and T cells \nare able to kill cancer cells more efficiently. The Nobel prize 2018 in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku \nHonjo for their breakthrough work on unleashing the body’s immune system to attack cancer, that \nhas led to an entirely new class of these drugs and brought lasting remissions to many patients \nwho had run out of options.",

Methotrexate’s principal mechanism of action relates to inhibition of amino-imidazole \ncarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase. AICAR accumulates intracellularly, competitively inhibits AMP deaminase, leading to an \naccumulation of AMP. The AMP is released and converted extracellularly to adenosine, which is a \npotent inhibitor of inflammation.

It is seen especially with intrathecal administration or high dose systemic use. Cerebellar toxicity \nmanifests as ataxia and slurred speech. Cerebral toxicity (seizures, dementia, and coma) is also \nseen.",

      "explanation": "Vincristine use is associated with alopecia. It is usually reversible frequently without \ndiscontinuation of the drug. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid derivative. It is mainly indicated for induction of remission in acute \nleukemias including ALL. Neurotoxicity is one of the main side effects.",

      "explanation": "All-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia \n(APL). RAR-alpha and retinoid X receptor dimer binds tretinoin tightly and causes differentiation \nof promyelocytes resulting in decreased proliferation. As monotherapy, tretinoin induces a high rate of complete remission and in combination with \nanthracyclines cures most of the patients.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The scenario is suggestive of metastatic melanoma and trametinib is used in this condition. It is a \nreversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK). It inhibits \nthe serine-threonine kinase domain of BRAF V600E mutant of MEK. It is widely used in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma. It can be used as a \nsingle agent but it is more effective when used with BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib. Adverse effects of this drug include rash, diarrhea, increased ALT, abdominal pain, stomatitis, \nincreased AST, anemia, etc. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are BRAF inhibitors used in metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody used in \nmetastatic or unresectable melanoma. Recent update: The FDA has approved the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and the \nMEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant unresectable or \nmetastatic melanoma.",
