      "explanation": "After 3 hours, 162mg of the drug will remain. In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is excreted in a given time. In the given question, 20mg out of 200mg is excreted in 90 minutes, 20/200 = 0.1 fraction is eliminated every 90 minutes. After 90 minutes, 200mg - 20 mg = 180 mg remains The next 90 minutes (i.e. after 180 minutes) = 180 x 0.1 = 18 mg is eliminated. 71 \nSold by @itachibot Therefore, 180 - 18 = 162 mg remains. Simpler way: 1/10 fraction of the drug is excreted in 90 minutes  9/10 remains after 90 minutes. 3 hours (180 min) is 2 times 90 minutes. So 200 x (9/10)(9/10) = 162 mg remains after 180 minutes",

It is calculated by the equation: CLorgan = Q x E Where, • Q - Organ blood flow • E - Extraction ratio (organ-specific) In the question, it is given that the hepatic blood flow (Q) is 2000 mL/min and the hepatic \nextraction ratio (E) is 0.5. Substituting the values in the above equation, CLorgan = 2000 X 0.5 = 1000 mL/min Note: The extraction ratio (E) is the fraction of the drug that is removed from the blood by the \neliminating organ.
