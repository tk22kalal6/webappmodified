      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Highly ionized drugs like foscarnet are mainly excreted by the kidneys. They are not reabsorbed from the renal tubules and are hence excreted unchanged by glomerular \nfiltration. Dose reduction is necessary in renal impairment to avoid the accumulation of the drug \nand associated toxicity. The non-ionized forms of weak acids and bases undergo tubular reabsorption. Option B: The blood-brain barrier limits the entry of ionized, non-lipid soluble drugs. Option C: A drug is more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when it is in its \nunionized, more lipophilic form. Option D: As the ionized form has low lipid solubility, it cannot penetrate cell membranes easily. 13 \nSold by @itachibot",

When the urine is alkaline, weakly \nacidic drugs like barbiturates are present in highly ionized form and excreted more rapidly.

      "explanation": "If the lactating mother needs to take medications that are deemed safe, the dosing optimally \nshould be 30-60 minutes after nursing and at least 3-4 hours before the next feeding. A minimum interval of 3-4 hours allows time for partial clearance of the drug. This ensures the \ninfants are not exposed to the peak maternal plasma concentration that may translate to higher \nlevels secreted into milk. Option A: Most drugs administered are detected in breast milk but most of them are excreted in \nvery small quantities that do not cause any effect in the infants. Option B: Breastfeeding should not be avoided altogether for all medications. Intake of cytotoxic \nagents and immunomodulatory agents are contraindications for breastfeeding. Option D: The timing of medication should preferably be at an interval where the infants are not \nexposed to higher maternal plasma concentrations. 21 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Omeprazole is replaced with another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) during coadministration with \nclopidogrel because of the action on CYP2C19. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is activated to its active metabolite by the liver enzyme CYP2C19. \nApart from CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 are also involved to a certain extent. Omeprazole serves as both substrate and inhibitor for CYP2C19. It may inhibit the activation of \nclopidogrel and decrease its antiplatelet action. Hence, they are not prescribed together.",

      "explanation": "The sub-family of CYP3A4 is A. In CYP enzymes nomenclature, the root CYP is followed by a number designating the family, a \nletter denoting the subfamily and another number designating the gene. Therefore, in CYP3A4: • 3 - family • A - subfamily A • 4 - individual gene coding for one specific isoenzyme There are numerous CYP isoenzymes in humans. Among them, CYP3A4 is the most abundant and \ncarries out the metabolism of nearly 50% of clinically used drugs.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In first order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is excreted in a given time. 75 mg of 200 mg is excreted in 90 minutes 75/200 = 37.5/100 = 0.375 is eliminated After 90 minutes; 200 mg-75 mg = 125 mg remains The next 90 minutes (after 180 minutes) = 125 x 0.375 = 46.875 mg is eliminated, and 125-46.875 \n= 78.125 mg remains The next 90 minutes (after 270 minutes) = 78.125 x 0.375 = 29.297 mg is eliminated, and \n78.125-29.297 = 48.828 remains The next 90 minutes (after 360 minutes) = 48.828 x 0.375 = 18.310 mg is eliminated, \n48.828-18.310 = 30.518 mg remains after 6 hours. Simpler way to calculate 3/8 fraction is excreted in 90 minutes  5/8 remains after 90 minutes. 6 hours (360 min) is 4 times of 90 minutes. 22 \nSold by @itachibot So 200 x (5/8)(5/8)(5/8)(5/8) = 30.518 mg remains after 360 minutes 23 \nSold by @itachibot Pharmacodynamics",
