It leads to the formation of a covalent bond with bifunctional alkylating agents and \nrepresents the key target in nucleic acids for alkylating agents. Alkylation results in \ncross-linking/abnormal base pairing of DNA which inhibits DNA replication. 863 \nSold by @itachibot Other sites that can be involved are: • N1 and N3 of adenosine • N3 of cytosine • O6 of guanine",

This leads to the destruction and desquamation of type I \npneumocytes and the resultant hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. Pulmonary toxicity begins with a dry cough, fine rales, and diffuse basal infiltrates on X-ray and \nmay progress to life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis. No specific treatment is available to \nameliorate the toxicity and managed by general symptomatic care. Note: Few case reports of methotrexate causing pulmonary fibrosis are reported. The association \nis still uncertain as the underlying disease process like RA can also contribute to fibrosis.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Ifosfamide",

        "c": "Bleomycin",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is most commonly associated with high-dose \nbusulfan. Incidence increases when coadministered with CYP inhibitors. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, previously known as veno-occlusive hepatic disease (VOD), \ninvolves primary hepatic sinusoidal injury that progresses to diffuse hepatocyte involvement and \npanvasculitis. This leads to multi-organ failure, and can be life-threatening.",

      "explanation": "L-asparaginase causes a hypercoagulable state. It is an enzyme and toxicity results due to the \ninhibition of protein synthesis in normal tissues. Side effects of L-asparaginase: • Thrombosis and increased coagulation - physiological anticlotting factors are impaired • Hemorrhage and bleeding - clotting factors are impaired • Hyperglycemia - insulin deficiency. 869 \nSold by @itachibot",

The risk of the bladder cancer formation is linearly related to the duration and intensity of \ncyclophosphamide treatment, supporting a causative role. Phosphoramide mustard is the primary \nmutagenic metabolite that causes bladder cancer in patients exposed to cyclophosphamide. 870 \nSold by @itachibot Monoclonal Antibodies",
