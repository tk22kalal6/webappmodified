      "explanation": "Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, is the most likely cause for these adverse effects. Patients being treated with protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir) develop a syndrome involving the \nderangement of lipid metabolism. This causes changes in body fat distribution. Type 2 diabetes \nmellitus has also been reported. This is called HIV/HAART-associated lipodystrophy. Indinavir can also precipitate in the urinary tract, causing nephrolithiasis, unless the patient is \nmaintained in a high state of hydration. Indinavir binds to the site of HIV-1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral gag-pol \npolyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious HIV. This results \nin the formation of immature, non-infectious viral particles. Option A: Azidothymidine or zidovudine, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Chronic \nzidovudine administration has been associated with nail hyperpigmentation. Option C: Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis. Its adverse \neffects include liver dysfunction and testosterone synthesis inhibition leading to gynecomastia. Option D: Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is one of the least toxic \nantiretroviral drugs. Neutropenia, headache, and nausea have been reported at \nhigher-than-recommended doses.",

It is administered intravenously. 486 \nSold by @itachibot It acts as an entry inhibitor. It blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of \nCD4 cells. It also interferes with post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus \nparticles into host cells and thus prevents the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion.",

      "explanation": "The integrase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of HIV is raltegravir. It inhibits the catalytic activity of the HIV-encoded integrase and prevents the integration of virus \nDNA into the host chromosome. It is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation by UGT1A1. The other two FDA-approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG). Options A and D: Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors. Option B: Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Note: Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended as the preferred third drug for HIV post-exposure \nprophylaxis as per the recent MOHFW ùan 2020 guideline, in line with WHO. The FDA approved dolutegravir tablets and suspension for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in \npediatric patients at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg who have never been treated \nfor HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase inhibitor class of drug. WHO recently recommended long-acting Cabotegravir, an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor \nmay be offered as a HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection. It is an \nIM injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis that has been shown to be highly effective at \nreducing the risk of HIV acquisition. The first 2 injections were administered 4 weeks apart, \nfollowed thereafter by an injection every 8 weeks. 487 \nSold by @itachibot Penicillins",
