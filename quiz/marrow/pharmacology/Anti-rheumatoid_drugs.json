      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Methotrexate is the DMARD that increases extracellular adenosine. It is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor that leads to purine synthesis inhibition and this \nis cytotoxic to lymphocytes. It also inhibits amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and \nthymidylate synthetase. This leads to increased extracellular adenosine which is \nanti-inflammatory. The increased extracellular adenosine is hepatotoxic and hence monitoring with LFT is needed \nevery 2-3 months.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The peripheral smear findings point to a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. Folinic acid is given \nwith methotrexate to decrease its side effects. Methotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor and thus can lead to a deficiency of \nfolic acid which may present as megaloblastic anemia. Folinic acid/leucovorin calcium/citrovorum factor is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. \nThus, it decreases the side effects caused due to folate deficiency.",
