It inhibits the synthesis of cortisol by inhibiting steroid 11 -hydroxylase \nreversibly. Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is a manifestation of symptoms that are precipitated by excessive \ncortisol production. Transsphenoidal surgery, radiation, and pharmacotherapy constitute the \nstandard treatment for tumor-related causes of CS (e.g. pituitary adenoma). The three main pharmacological approaches are: • Cortisol synthesis inhibitors: Ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, etomidate, \naminoglutethimide • ACTH secretion inhibitors: Cyproheptadine, pasireotide, octreotide, cabergoline • Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist: Mifepristone Note: Metyrapone is also used to test the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback pathway in the \ndiagnosis of Cushing syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "\"A\" here corresponds to 11-beta-HSD2 (11-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase2). It converts active \ncortisol to inactive cortisone. Cortisol is active and can bind to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors whereas \ncortisone is inactive and does not bind to either. The selective inactivation of cortisol is required \nin certain sites such as the distal nephron so that the specific autoregulatory responses to \naldosterone can be achieved. Therefore, cortisol (active) is metabolized to cortisone (inactive) by 11-beta-HSD2 in the kidney, so \nas to protect renal mineralocorticoid receptors from cortisol binding. Some tissues, like the liver, \ncan convert inactive cortisone back to active cortisol through an enzyme called 11-beta-HSD1 (\"B\" \nin the image). This completes the “cortisone–cortisol shuttle” because the kidney can inactivate \ncortisol where it is not needed and the liver can reactivate it afterward. 627 \nSold by @itachibot However, when circulating cortisol levels are very high, as in severe Cushing syndrome, they can \noverwhelm this protective mechanism, allowing cortisol to bind to and activate the \nmineralocorticoid receptor. This leads to volume expansion, hypertension, and hypokalemia often \nobserved in hypercortisolism. A mutation of 11-beta-HSD2 also causes a similar clinical picture \nand is the reason for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. 17-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are involved in the \nmetabolism of sex steroids.",
