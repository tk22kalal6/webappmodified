      "explanation": "Imatinib mesylate blocks the action of the chimeric fusion protein of BCR-ABL. It targets the \nBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and inhibits the activity of the fusion protein. A single molecular event, 9:22 translocation, leads to the expression of the Abelson \nproto-oncogene kinase (ABL) fused to BCR (breakpoint cluster region) yielding a constitutively \nactivated protein kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Imatinib causes remission in &gt;90% \nof patients in the chronic phase of CML.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of the development of resistance to imatinib, which is a tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor. This condition arises due to point mutations in three separate regions of the \nkinase domain. The contact points between imatinib and the enzyme become sites of mutations in drug-resistant \nleukemic cells and hence these mutations prevent tight binding of the drug and lock the enzyme in \nits open configuration (the configuration in which it has access to the substrate and is \nenzymatically active). Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance. Nilotinib retains inhibitory activity in the presence of most point mutations that confer resistance \nto imatinib.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Denileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin made from the genetic recombination of IL-2 and the \ncatalytically active fragment of diphtheria toxin. It is indicated for advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with &gt;20% of T cells \nexpressing the surface marker CD25. After binding to the IL-2 receptors, it is internalized by \nendocytosis. The active fragment of diphtheria toxin then is released into the cytosol, where it \ninhibits protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation, leading to cell death. Immunotoxins are proteins that contain a toxin along with an antibody that binds specifically to \ntarget cells. Antibody-drug conjugates are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologically \nactive cytotoxic (anticancer) drug. These antibody-targeted drug therapies are cell-specific to kill \nefficiently the target cells that bind and internalize the drug conjugate. Examples are: • Gemtuzumab ozogamicin - Monoclonal antibody against CD33 linked to a semisynthetic \nderivative of calicheamicin, a potent antitumor antibiotic. It was approved for the treatment of \nacute myeloid leukemia. • Brentuximab vedotin - Anti-CD30 IgG1 monoclonal antibody linked with the \nmicrotubule-disrupting agent MMAE. It is used for the treatment of Hodgkin and anaplastic \nlymphoma. • Ado-trastuzumab emtansine - It combines the HER2-targeted properties of trastuzumab with the \nantimicrotubule agent DM1 (derived from maytansine), allowing preferential intracellular drug \ndelivery to HER2+ cells. It is used in the treatment of HER+ breast cancer. 904 \nSold by @itachibot",
