      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of vancomycin is cell wall synthesis inhibition. The bacterial cell wall has long chains of peptidoglycan and is cross-linked to each other by the \naction of the enzyme transglycosylase. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide group of antibiotics that \nbinds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the synthesized peptidoglycan. This inhibits the \ntransglycosylase enzyme and prevents elongation and cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This leads to \nthe weakening of the cell wall causing lysis. It exhibits a time-dependant or concentration-independent killing of bacteria. It primarily acts on \nGram +ve organisms which are resistant to other antibiotics such as methicillin-resistant \nstaphylococcus and ampicillin resistant enterococci. Lipoglycopeptides are a new generation of glycopeptide congeners which include telavancin, \ndalbavancin, and oritavancin. Dalbavancin and Oritovancin are administered as a single \nintravenous dose for skin and soft-tissue infections. 511 \nSold by @itachibot",
