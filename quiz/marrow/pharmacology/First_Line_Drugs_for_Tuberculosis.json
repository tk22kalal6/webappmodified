      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The reason for administering multi-drug therapy in tuberculosis is to prevent the development of \nresistance. Resistance to individual drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs by spontaneous point \nmutations that occur at a low but predictable rate (10-7 to 10-10 ). Development of this drug \nresistance is almost invariably the result of monotherapy, i.e., the failure of the health care \nprovider to prescribe at least 2 drugs to which the tubercle bacilli are susceptible. Hence, \nmulti-drug therapy is recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most effective drug against extracellular mycobacteria is Rifampicin. 567 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Isoniazid and Rifampicin act against both intracellular and \nextracellular mycobacterium. But, Rifampicin inhibits the extracellular mycobacteria at much \nlower drug concentrations than isoniazid. Option B: Pyrazinamide acts only against intracellular mycobacterium. Option C: Ethambutol acts against only extracellular mycobacteria but is not as effective as \nrifampicin. It is a bacteriostatic drug. Fast-multiplying bacteria are highly susceptible to its \naction. Note: Streptomycin is primarily active against only the extracellular tubercle bacilli as its \npenetration into the cells is very poor.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Isoniazid",
        "b": "Rifampicin",

        "d": "Ethambutol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Isoniazid is the first-line antitubercular drug that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid. Isoniazid is a first-line bactericidal drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This drug \nenters bacilli by passive diffusion. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme \ncatalase-peroxidase(the enzyme encoded by the Kat gene). Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the \nreactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with NAD that inhibit InhA and KasA. Hence, \nisoniazid inhibits the production of mycolic acid. The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with NADP. This complex inhibits \nmycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of DNA synthesis. Side effects of isoniazid include: • Peripheral neuritis due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxal \nphosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, pyridoxine 10mg/day (vitamin B6) is given prophylactically \nalong with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity. • Hepatitis - isoniazid must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity. • Rashes • Anaemia • Arthralgia Toxicity of isoniazid results in metabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma. Other options: Option B: Rifampin acts by binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form a stable \ndrug-enzyme complex. This complex suppresses RNA synthesis. Side effects of rifampin are \nhepatitis, flu-like illness, orange-red colored urine, and body secretions. Option C: Pyrazinamide is a prodrug, it is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acid \nwhich makes the intracellular environment acidic and collapses the transmembrane proton \nmotive force, thereby killing the bacteria. Side effects include hyperuricemia and hepatotoxicity. Option D: Ethambutol inhibits arabinose transferase III, thereby decreasing arabinogalactan \nbiosynthesis. This results in disruption in mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. Optic neuritis is an 568 \nSold by @itachibot important side effect of ethambutol. It results in decreased visual acuity and loss of red-green \ndiscrimination.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Isoniazid, a key agent in the ATT, is metabolized primarily through N-acetylation by the \ngenetically polymorphic N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) enzyme. Slow acetylators (group A) of \nisoniazid are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy. The rate of metabolism of isoniazid is determined by the genetic polymorphism of NAT2 enzyme \nand classified broadly into two groups - slow and fast acetylators. In slow acetylators, the drug accumulates due to slow metabolism resulting in an increased risk \nof side effects, and hence they should undergo periodic monitoring. Peripheral neuropathy is a \nmore frequent side effect of INH when compared to hepatotoxicity. Fast acetylators metabolize the drug rapidly and show less response to standard doses and the \ntherapy may be less effective.",

Benzodiazepines can be used to 569 \nSold by @itachibot control seizures.
