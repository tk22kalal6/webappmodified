      "explanation": "Statins act on the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, thus inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. Note: Necrotizing myopathy is a newly defined form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. \nPatients who have anti-HMG Co-A reductase antibodies should not be given statins to control 237 \nSold by @itachibot high cholesterol as they may develop this type of statin-induced necrotizing myopathy.",

      "explanation": "Atorvastatin has a longer half-life (19 ± 9 hours) and may be taken at any time of the day. Other drugs that can be taken irrespective of the time of day: • Rosuvastatin - has a half-life of 20 ± 6 hours • Pitavastatin - has a half-life of 12 hours All other statins, which have a plasma half-life of around 4 hours or less, should preferably be \nadministered in the evening.",

      "question": "Question 3: A patient with hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy presents to your OPD for follow-up. \nYou notice his cholesterol is still high and decide to add on another drug that directly inhibits \nthe absorption of cholesterol. Which of the following will you prescribe?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Ezetimibe",
        "b": "Orlistat",
        "c": "Cholestyramine",
        "d": "Niacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Ezetimibe is the drug that prevents hypercholesterolemia by directly inhibiting the absorption of \ncholesterol. Ezetimibe acts by interfering with a specific cholesterol transport protein NPC1L1 in the intestinal \nmucosa and reduces the absorption of both dietary and biliary cholesterol. It causes \na compensatory increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis but LDL cholesterol is decreased. Statins \nblock this enhanced cholesterol synthesis (cholesterol synthesis inhibitors) and so their \ncombination has a synergistic effect. Option B: Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug that acts by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipase and \nthus interferes with the digestion and absorption of dietary triglycerides. Option C: Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant. The bile-acid sequestrants are highly \npositively charged and bind negatively charged bile acids. Because of their large size, the resins \nare not absorbed, and the bound bile acids are excreted in the stool. Cholestyramine primarily reduces LDL levels by increasing hepatic bile acid synthesis; which \nresults in increased LDL uptake and diversion of cholesterol to bile acid production. Option D: Niacin reduces lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and reduces hepatic \ntriglyceride synthesis.",

        "b": "Niacin",

        "d": "Colestipol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The drug that decreases Lipoprotein(a) is niacin. Niacin is the only lipid-lowering agent that lowers lipoprotein(a) levels significantly. It also results \nin a decrease in LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides along with an increase in HDL cholesterol. The main adverse effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing and pruritus which can be controlled by \npretreatment with aspirin. Niacin can also cause hepatotoxicity, GI toxicity, and hyperuricemia. 238 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 5: Which of the following drugs would you warn a patient taking statins against, due to the \nhighest risk of myopathy?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Fenofibrate",
        "b": "Gemfibrozil",
        "c": "Colestipol",
        "d": "Niacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Myopathy risk is highest when statins are used along with gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that inhibits the uptake of statins into the hepatocytes and prevents its \nmetabolism, thereby increasing its bioavailability. Thus, the risk of toxicity of statins increases. Other drugs interacting similarly with statins include: • Cyclosporine • Digoxin • Warfarin • Macrolide antibiotics • Azole antifungals. Option A: Fenofibrate does not have much interaction with statins. Option C: Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant and does not have much effect on statin \nmetabolism. Option D: Niacin can also rarely increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy but the risk is much \nlower than that with gemfibrozil. So here gemfibrozil is the best answer.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Evolocumab is a PCSK-9 inhibitor that is administered as a subcutaneous injection. PCSK-9 is a protease that binds to the LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocyte and enhances \nthe lysosomal degradation of the LDL receptor. This results in higher plasma LDL levels. \ninhibition of PCSK-9 results in a reduction of plasma LDL levels. Two approved PCSK-9 inhibitors are alirocumab and evolocumab.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor is lomitapide. MTP adds triglycerides to nascent VLDL in the liver and to chylomicrons in the intestine. Its \ninhibition decreases VLDL secretion and thus decreases the accumulation of LDL in the plasma. It \nis approved for use in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Options A: Ticlopidine is an antiplatelet agent. Option B: Gugulipid is a plant extract that is commonly used for hyperlipidemia but has very \nlittle/no evidence to support its use. 239 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Evinacumab is a recently approved angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibitor. It is \nindicated as an adjunct to other LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies for homozygous familial \nhypercholesterolemia in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.",

      "explanation": "Fibrates increase the lipoprotein lipase activity through PPAR- and cause increased lipolysis of \ntriglycerides. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in the degradation of VLDL. Fibrates bind to PPAR alpha \nand cause stimulation of lipoprotein lipase enzyme.
