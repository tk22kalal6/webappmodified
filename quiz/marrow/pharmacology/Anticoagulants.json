      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The primary mechanism of action of heparin is by activation of antithrombin. In patients with atrial fibrillation that has persisted for more than 48 hours, heparin can be used \nto reduce the risk of thrombus formation and embolization until the warfarin level is therapeutic \nor cardioversion is performed. Heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWHs), and fondaparinux have no intrinsic \nanticoagulant activity. They bind to antithrombin and accelerates the rate at which it inhibits \nvarious coagulation proteases, especially thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. LMWH has some action against thrombin. However, fondaparinux has no action against \nthrombin. Antithrombin inhibits these factors by serving as a “suicide substrate”.",

      "explanation": "Antithrombin-III is mandatory for the action of heparin as an anticoagulant. Reduced \nantithrombin levels can lead to resistance. Heparin resistance refers to failure to achieve a therapeutic aPTT with daily doses of heparin of \n35,000 units or more. In true heparin resistance, there is an actual blunting of heparin’s anticoagulant effect. This \noccurs due to: • Low ATIII levels (most common cause) • Increased heparin-binding plasma proteins (acute phase reactants) • Increased heparin clearance (e.g. due to splenomegaly in liver disease) Low ATIII levels could be due to decreased synthesis (hereditary, hepatic failure), increased \nconsumption (DIC, MAHA, or in a bypass circuit) or increased loss (nephrotic syndrome). The dose of heparin has to be increased to achieve therapeutic aPTT. Severe antithrombin \ndeficiency may require antithrombin concentrate as well. 771 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Coagulation profile monitoring is needed for lepirudin. Lepirudin is a direct irreversible thrombin inhibitor and its most adverse reaction is bleeding. The \nrisk of bleeding can be reduced by implementing an appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment \nstrategy. Thus, coagulation profile monitoring is required for lepirudin. However, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and dabigatran do not bind to endothelium or many plasma \nproteins and thus, the response to these drugs at the usual doses is consistent from patient to \npatient. Hence, monitoring is not required.",

      "explanation": "Warfarin therapy is usually monitored by measuring prothrombin time. Prothrombin time is sensitive to the reduction in levels of prothrombin, factor VII, and factor X. \nThe test is performed by adding thromboplastin, which is a reagent containing tissue factor, \nphospholipid and calcium to citrated plasma and determining the time to clot formation. Due to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastin, the International normalized ratio (INR) was \ndeveloped to standardize the reporting of prothrombin time. In INR, the patient’s prothrombin \ntime is divided by mean normal prothrombin time and this ratio is multiplied by the International \nSensitivity Index (ISI) of the particular thromboplastin reagent. Warfarin therapy should be monitored with INR every 3–4 weeks. The target INR is 2.0–3.0. In \npatients with mechanical heart valves, the target INR is 2.5–3.5.",

Option D: Vitamin K1 is the specific antidote for warfarin-induced bleeding, but it takes 6-24 \nhours for the clotting factors to be resynthesized and released in blood after Vitamin K \nadministration and hence its action is delayed for several hours.
