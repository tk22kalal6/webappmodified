      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This is a case of hypocalcemia following a massive blood transfusion and IV calcium gluconate is \nthe preferred treatment. The hypocalcemia results from Ca2+ chelation by citrate (added to the blood product as \npreservative and anticoagulant). Calcium gluconate is the preferred over calcium chloride for the \nemergency treatment of hypocalcemia because it is less irritating and better tolerated. However, calcium chloride may be preferable to calcium gluconate in the presence of abnormal \nliver function, because decreased citrate metabolism results in a slower release of ionized calcium. \nIt is generally reserved for severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, (&lt;4 mg/dL) and when given, \nshould be administered via a central venous access device to avoid extravasation and tissue \nnecrosis. Calcium carbonate and calcium lactate are oral preparations of calcium. 639 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Bisphosphonates are used in the first-line management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphates. They specifically inhibit bone resorption and \nthus are very effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates concentrate at sites of active remodeling. They remain in the matrix until the \nbone is remodeled. Then, they are released in the acid environment of the resorption lacunae and \ninduce apoptosis in osteoclasts. Classification of bisphosphonates (mainly based on potency): First-generation: • Etidronate (least potent) • Clodronate • Tiludronate Second-generation: 10-100 times more potent than the first generation • Alendronate • Pamidronate • Ibadronate Third-generation: 10,000 times more potent than the first generation • Risedronate • Zoledronate",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Bisphosphonates are not recommended to be administered with food to minimize esophageal \nirritation. Oral bisphosphonates have very limited bioavailability (&lt;1-10%). Bisphosphonates are \nrecommended to be administered after an overnight fast with a full glass of water at least 30 \nminutes before breakfast. Options A and B- Remaining upright for 30 minutes after dosing and taking proton pump \ninhibitors at bedtime can decrease the symptoms. Option C- As esophageal irritation is due to the local direct effect of the oral formulation, shifting \nto intravenous formulations reduces the symptoms. Note- The prescribing information of all the oral bisphosphonates states that it has to be taken \nalong with tap or filtered water, and not mineral water as it contains higher amounts of calcium \nwhich can interfere with the absorption of bisphosphonates. It is prudent to inform patients to not \nhave the medications with water having higher calcium levels. 641 \nSold by @itachibot",
