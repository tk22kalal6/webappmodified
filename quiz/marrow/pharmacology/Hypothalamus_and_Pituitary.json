      "explanation": "GH deferral is only recommended for the first year after treatment of leukemia. 605 \nSold by @itachibot Because of the anti-insulin action of GH, there is an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus and therefore, fasting glucose levels should be monitored periodically during GH \ntherapy. Due to the rare potential for developing intracranial hypertension, fundoscopic \nexamination is recommended at the initiation of therapy and at periodic intervals thereafter. \nRapid growth induced by GH can cause slipped epiphyses or scoliosis in children. Estrogens (OCPs and estrogen supplements) inhibit GH action so that a larger dose is needed to \nmaintain the same IGF-1 level. The adverse effects of growth hormone are: Children \nAdults Intracranial hypertensionInc \nreased risk oftype 2 diabetes \nSlipped epiphysisScoliosis Peripheral edemaCarpal tunn \nel syndromeArthralgiasMyalg \nia",

It is indicated for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and acromegaly. Bromocriptine, lisuride, and apomorphine are short-acting when compared with cabergoline. Bromocriptine is an ergot alkaloid derivative used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, \nhyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and Parkinson's disease. Cabergoline is preferred over \nbromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia due to lower adverse effects such as nausea and also due to \ndosing advantage (twice a week instead of daily dosing). Lisuride is indicated in early Parkinson's disease but is also known to decrease prolactin levels \nand prevent migraine attacks. Apomorphine is a morphine derivative used to treat hypomobile \n\"off\" episodes of advanced Parkinson's disease.",

Cabergoline, Bromocriptine, and Pergolide are ergot derivatives and are associated with valvular \nheart disease. The risk of valvular heart disease from ergot therapy is associated with higher doses \nof the drug (necessary for Parkinson's disease treatment) but not with the lower doses used in \ntreating hyperprolactinemia.

      "explanation": "The given clinical history of the patient and the endoscopic image showing prominent cherry-red \nspots are suggestive of bleeding esophageal varices. Octreotide is indicated in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. It is a somatostatin analog that \nreduces azygous blood flow significantly and decreases variceal bleeding. Other drugs that can be used for the management of bleeding esophageal varices: • Terlipressin • Vasopressin • Propranolol Option A: Desmopressin is a selective V2 receptor agonist used for central diabetes insipidus and \nnocturnal enuresis. Option B: Propranolol (non-selective beta-blocker) is used in the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding \nand not in its acute management. Option D: Terlipressin is a vasoconstrictor used for bleeding esophageal varices but may \ncompromise cardiac function and induce ischemia and hence can't be used in this case. Note: Although terlipressin is a vasoconstrictor and is be used for bleeding oesophagal varices, the \npatient in this scenario has a history of MI (undergone coronary bypass surgery). Terlipressin can \ncompromise cardiac function (reduces cardiac output and ejection fraction) and induce ischemia. \nHence, it is not preferred in this case.",
