        "d": "Carbidopa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is a naturally occurring aromatic amino acid and an immediate precursor of dopamine that can \ncross the blood-brain barrier. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier because of the \npolar nature of the molecule. Levodopa is also a polar compound but it can cross the blood-brain \nbarrier through an aromatic amino acid transporter. Therefore, levodopa is used therapeutically when dopamine is required for central action. \nLevodopa is converted to dopamine by the decarboxylase enzyme. Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor and does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier.",

        "d": "Domperidone reduces levodopa induced emesis and its therapeutic potential"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Domperidone is an antidopaminergic antiemetic that can reverse levodopa-induced emesis \nwithout affecting the therapeutic potential as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The antiemetic effect is through its action on CTZ which is outside the blood-brain barrier. Option A: Typical antipsychotics like phenothiazines can reduce the efficacy of levodopa because \nof its central D2 blocking property. Option B: Levodopa is a prodrug. It is converted into dopamine by the decarboxylase enzyme in \nCNS. Option C: Pyridoxine can reduce the effect of levodopa by increasing its peripheral conversion to \ndopamine by potentiating peripheral dopa decarboxylase enzyme.",

      "explanation": "Behavioral adverse effects like confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, delusions, postural \nhypotension are not reduced after the addition of carbidopa. In fact, they are increased in patients who are taking levodopa with peripheral decarboxylase \ninhibitors. This is because higher levels of dopamine are formed in CNS. The combination of levodopa with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors like carbidopa inhibits \nperipheral adverse effects of dopamine. This decreases the adverse effects like: • Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting • Cardiac arrhythmias • On and off effect of motor performance",

It is characterized by extreme rigidity, confusion, and hyperthermia. It is an emergency condition that can turn fatal if immediate intervention is not done. Neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome is commonly associated with the use of typical antipsychotics. Option A: Wearing off phenomenon - Each dose of levodopa improves mobility for a period of 1-2 \nhours. After that, the effect of the drug wears off, and rigidity and akinesia return. This can be \nsurpassed by increasing the dosing and frequency. Option B: On/off phenomenon - Rapid fluctuation between on and off periods. • On period: When the patient has a beneficial effect of the medications but with disabling \ndyskinesias • Off period: No beneficial effects from anti-Parkinsonism medications. 'Wearing off' and 'On / Off' phenomenon occur with long-term treatment of levodopa. Option D: Serotonin syndrome occurs with co-prescription of MAO-inhibitors and SSRIs.",

It inhibits the peripheral metabolism of levodopa thereby increasing the bioavailability of \nlevodopa. Options B and D: Ropinirole and apomorphine are dopamine receptor agonists and do not have \nany significant effect on levodopa bioavailability. Option C: Amantadine which is an antiviral drug is also anti-Parkinsonian due to its varied actions \nincluding increased release and decreased uptake of dopamine.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Tolcapone and entacapone are selective, potent, and reversible COMT (catechol-O-methyl \ntransferase) inhibitors. COMT metabolizes levodopa and blockade of this pathway prolongs the half-life of levodopa and \nallows a larger fraction of the administered dose to reach the brain. Option B: Rasagiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor. Option C: Amantadine acts by antagonism of the NMDA type of glutamate receptors. Option D: Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that is FDA-approved as a 'rescue therapy' for \nthe acute intermittent treatment of 'off' episodes.",

      "explanation": "Selegiline acts as a selective MAO-B inhibitor. At higher doses, MAO-A can also be inhibited. Higher doses are used for depression and \nadministered in the form of the transdermal patch. Option B: Selective MAO-B inhibitors do not interfere significantly with the peripheral \nmetabolism of dietary amines and do not cause cheese reaction. Option C: It has lower efficacy than levodopa but when added with levodopa it prolongs its action \nand also decreases the wearing-off effect of levodopa. Option D: Selegiline forms metabolites like amphetamine and methamphetamine that can result \nin anxiety, insomnia, and other undesirable effects. Rasagiline, unlike selegiline, does not form \namphetamines as metabolites.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The symptoms in this patient are suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the \nfirst-line choice of treatment for this condition. Restless leg syndrome is a typical sensory-motor disorder that generally affects the legs during \nrest periods, especially sleep. There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated with \nburning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergic \nhypofunction is postulated. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating \nfactors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, \ngabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) are preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, \nropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term \naugmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders. FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: • Gabapentin • Ropinirole • Pramipexole • Rotigotine A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from \ngabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of \nmoderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a \nhistory of substance use disorder. Option A: Benztropine is an anticholinergic that can be used for drug-induced parkinsonism. Option C: Riluzole is a benzothiazole derivative that is used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Option D: Benzodiazepines like clonazepam can be used as co-adjuvant drugs in the treatment of \nrestless leg syndrome but should not be used as first-line therapy.",
