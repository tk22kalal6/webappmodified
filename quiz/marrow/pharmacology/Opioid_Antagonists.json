      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Both naloxone and naltrexone are pure opioid antagonists. Nalorphine is an agonist-antagonist. It has antagonistic activity at the mu receptor and additional \nagonistic activity at the kappa receptor. Note: Nalmefene is sometimes classified as a pure antagonist but it has additional kappa receptor \npartial agonist activity.",

      "explanation": "392 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical picture points towards opioid-induced constipation. Methylnaltrexone, an \nopioid antagonist with predominant peripheral action is best suited for treating opioid-induced \nconstipation. Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral µ receptor antagonist. It was introduced in the treatment of \nopioid-induced constipation refractory to other measures. It is a quaternary ammonium compound and hence cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. It can \nreverse the effects mediated by peripheral opioid receptors and spares CNS effects like analgesia. The peripherally acting opioid antagonists include: • Methylnaltrexone • Naloxegol • Naldemedine • Alvimopan",

Option B: Naloxone is considered a pure opioid receptor antagonist but at high doses, it is found \nto have partial agonistic activity on the - and -opioid receptors.

Opioid overdose symptoms: • Triad of coma, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils (miosis) • Hypotension, bradycardia • Shallow breathing • Hypothermia Naloxone is also used for reversing neonatal asphyxia due to opioid usage in labor. Naloxone is a \npure opioid antagonist which reverses all effects except sedation. Note: Naloxone is contraindicated in infants born to mothers with opiate addiction as it may \nprecipitate acute neonatal withdrawal with seizures. 393 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Pentazocine can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent patients.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Methadone is used as a substitute drug for the maintenance therapy of opioid (heroin) \ndependence. This is because of its good oral bioavailability and long half-life. Methadone is substituted for opioids during detoxification to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Once \nstabilized, the dose is gradually reduced and the drug is stopped slowly over days. Due to its long half-life and accumulation in tissues, discontinuing the drug still results in low \nconcentrations of the drug in plasma resulting in protracted withdrawal symptoms. 394 \nSold by @itachibot Maintainance therapy for opioid dependence: • Long-acting opioid agonist - a safer substitute like methadone is given in a supervised manner to \nprevent withdrawal symptoms • Partial agonist - buprenorphine can also be used • Clonidine, lofexidine - alpha-2 agonists act as sympatholytic and reduce the withdrawal \nsymptoms • LAAM(L-Alpha-Acetyl-Methadol) - opioid agonist which reduces craving • Naltrexone - is an opioid antagonist used in maintenance therapy to prevent relapses",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Naltrexone is used for the prevention of relapse in opioid addiction. It is given only after initial opioid detoxification. The patient should be opioid-free for 7-10 days \nand have a negative naloxone challenge (no withdrawal after naloxone administration). Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist which is more potent than naloxone. It is orally active and \nhas a long duration of action which makes it suitable for opioid blockade therapy in post-addicts.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Discontinuation of naltrexone does not cause withdrawal symptoms",
        "b": "It satisfies craving in opioid addicts",
        "c": "It blocks the effects of opioids if they are used",
        "d": "It is administered only when the patient has completed detoxification from opioids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Naltrexone does not satisfy the craving of opioid addicts. It is an opioid antagonist with a high \naffinity for  opioid receptors. Naltrexone does not suppress craving in opioid addiction but it suppresses craving in chronic \nalcoholics. Opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine suppress craving and withdrawal \nsymptoms and are therefore used in the first stage of detoxification in opioid addiction. Option A: Discontinuation of naltrexone ingestion has no negative physical consequences, as \nopposed to discontinuation of agonist maintenance therapies, which results in the emergence of \nopioid withdrawal symptoms. This is a major reason for noncompliance and treatment failure. Option C: It blocks the effects of opioids and prevents the user from experiencing subjective \nsymptoms of opioid intoxication such as euphoria on subsequent use. As the user does not \nexperience these symptoms, he does not develop a craving for the substance. Thus, naltrexone \nprevents relapse. Option D: It is only administered when the patient has completed a medically supervised \ndetoxification from opioids because it can cause immediate withdrawal symptoms.",
