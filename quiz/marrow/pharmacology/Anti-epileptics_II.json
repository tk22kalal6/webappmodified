      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Levetiracetam has a binding affinity to synaptic vesicular protein SV2A. SV2A plays a role in \nvesicle recycling following exocytosis of neurotransmitter When levetiracetam bind to this synaptic vesicular protein, it decreases the release of excitatory \nneurotransmitter glutamate thus preventing seizures. Levetiracetam also inhibits N-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.Thus, \nit is considered a broad-spectrum antiepileptic as it has an effect on multiple channels.",

      "explanation": "Gabapentin exerts its analgesic activity by inhibiting the Ca2+ channel current in this patient who \nis most likely suffering from post-herpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin and pregabalin have close structural similarity to GABA. Still, they do not act through \nthe effects of GABA receptors or any other mechanism related to GABA-mediated \nneurotransmission. They inhibit the calcium channel current which decreases the entry of calcium in the presynaptic \nneuron. When calcium entry in the neuron is reduced, there is a decrease in the release of \nglutamate. This lowers the excitability of the neuron, thus reducing seizure activity. Therapeutic use of these drugs: Gabapentin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia pain Pregabalin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia pain, diabetic neuropathy pain, spinal cord \ninjury pain, fibromyalgia pain.",
