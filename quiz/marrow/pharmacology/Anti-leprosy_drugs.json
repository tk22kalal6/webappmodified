      "options": {
        "a": "Cell wall synthesis inhibitor",

        "c": "Protein synthesis inhibitor",
        "d": "Cell membrane inhibitor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of dapsone is inhibition of folic acid synthesis. Dapsone [4,4■diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS)] is a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid \n(PABA) and a competitive inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthase in the folate pathway. It is weakly \nbactericidal and can cause mild hemolysis, and rarely anemia or psychosis. DDS syndrome is a rare side effect of dapsone therapy in leprosy patients which starts after 5-6 \nweeks of starting dapsone and leads to exfoliative dermatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, \nlymphadenopathy, fever and hepatitis and may be fatal. It is also called 'five-week dermatitis'.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Dapsone is not used in the treatment of schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is the drug recommended \nfor this condition. Dapsone with pyrimethamine and leucovorin can be given for prophylaxis of Toxoplasma \nencephalitis in HIV patients with CD4&lt;100. Along with trimethoprim, it can be given for \nprophylaxis and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia. However, cotrimoxazole remains the \ndrug of choice in both conditions. The uses of dapsone are: Infections • Leprosy • Pneumocystis jerovecii infections (prophylaxis and treatment) • Malaria • Toxoplasma gondi infections (prophylaxis) Inflammatory conditions • Dermatitis herpetiformis • Pemphigoid • Relapsing chondritis • Linear IgA bullous disease",

      "explanation": "Ofloxacin is the most bactericidal anti leprotic drug amongst the given drugs. It exhibits high activity against M. leprae, and it is being used in alternative multidrug therapy \n(MDT) regimens in rifampicin-resistant cases. As a component of MDT, it has been found to \nhasten the bacteriological and clinical response. Among the macrolides, clarithromycin has activity against leprosy bacilli and is used for \nalternative MDT in cases resistant to both rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Azithromycin shows \nactivity against Mycobacterium avium complex but not lepra bacilli. Note: Rifampicin is the most potent bactericidal anti leprotic drug.",

It is indicated in recurring and persistent ENL lesions despite the completion of at least \ntwo courses of glucocorticoid therapy. 587 \nSold by @itachibot Thalidomide is not effective in type 1 lepra reaction. If type 1 reactions occur after initiation of \nantimycobacterial therapy, they are termed reversal reactions and it is histologically more \ntuberculoid.

      "explanation": "The presence of tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules as seen in the image is suggestive \nof Type II lepra reaction in which rifampicin must be avoided. Rifampicin is highly bactericidal to M. leprae and results in high kill rates and massive release of \nbacterial antigens and may aggravate type 2 lepra reactions (also called erythema nodosum \nleprosum). Options A and B: Clofazimine and corticosteroids are indicated in both type 1 and type 2 lepra \nreactions. Option C: Thalidomide is indicated in type 2 lepra reactions.",
