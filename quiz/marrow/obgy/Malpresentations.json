This is the most effective intervention and should be the first \nmanoeuvre to be performed in shoulder dystocia. 245 \nSold by @itachibot McRoberts manoeuvre: • Flexion and abduction of the maternal hips (positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen). • The pelvic rotation which occurs due to the straightening of the sacrum tends to free the \nimpacted anterior shoulder of the baby. • Suprapubic pressure may be used simultaneously. • The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is the most common nerve to get injured during this \nmanoeuvre. If the first line of management fails, proceed with internal rotational manoeuvres such as Rubin's \nand Wood corkscrew in McRoberts position. Rubin's manoeuvre: • Internal rotational manoeuver used to deliver the baby in case of shoulder dystocia. • It involves dislodging the easily accessible shoulder towards the anterior aspect of the chest from \nunder the pubic symphysis by 30-45° while staying in the McRoberts' position. • Pressure is applied on the scapular aspect (posteriorly) of the shoulder. Wood corkscrew manoeuvre: • Internal rotational manoeuver used to deliver the baby in case of shoulder dystocia. • It involves dislodging the posterior shoulder by 180° in a corkscrew fashion to lie beneath the \npubic symphysis while staying in McRobert's position. • Pressure is applied on the clavicular aspect (anteriorly) of the shoulder. 246 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Applying a gentle suprapubic pressure is the first step in the management of shoulder dystocia \nalong with McRoberts manoeuvre. Fundal pressure is not a method of delivery in such cases. Hernandez and Wendel suggested the use of a shoulder dystocia drill to better organize \nemergency management: • Call for help and mobilize labour assistants, anaesthesia and pediatric doctors. • An attempt at traction is tried followed by episiotomy to afford room posteriorly. • Apply pressure suprapubically, not fundally, with the palm or fist, directing the pressure on the \nanterior shoulder. • This should be both downward (below the pubic bone) and laterally (toward the baby's face or \nsternum) in conjunction with the McRoberts manoeuvre. These manoeuvres will resolve most cases of shoulder dystocia.

Management options: With gentle traction on the fetal body, the cervix may be manually slipped over the occiput. 255 \nSold by @itachibot If this is not successful, then Dührssen incisions may be necessary. These are a set of three \nincisions in the cervix: • Can be made at the 2 and 10 o'clock position on the cervix. An additional incision at the 6 o’clock \nposition is sometimes needed. • Done for delivery of aftercoming head in breech or delivery of head through an incompletely \ndilated cervix. • There is a significant risk of haemorrhage; the cervical incision may extend upwards within the \nbroad ligament causing broad ligament haematoma. Other alternatives include intravenous nitroglycerin, typically 100 g, to provide cervical \nrelaxation. General anaesthesia with halogenated agents is another option. As a last resort, the following methods are used: • Zavanelli manoeuvre: It involves the replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by \ncesarean delivery. This is performed for the protruding head and intractable shoulder dystocia. • Symphysiotomy: The intervening symphyseal cartilage and ligamentous supports are cut to \nwiden the symphysis pubis.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Occipitoposterior position (OP) is the most common cause of a mobile head at term. It is the most common fetal malposition. It is an abnormal position seen in the vertex \npresentation, not an abnormal presentation. • Occipitoposterior position is commonly seen in android pelvis/deflexed head. • The engaging diameter of this position is sub-occipitofrontal/occipitofrontal. • The most common type in occipitoposterior position is right OP. • A persistent occipitoposterior position results from a failure of internal rotation prior to birth. 258 \nSold by @itachibot Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is a disproportion in the size of the fetus relative to the \nmaternal pelvis. This can result in the failure of progress of labour in the second stage. This \nusually occurs due to fetal malposition e.g., extended or asynclitic fetal head, occipitoposterior or \ntransverse position. It is also seen in malpresentations like mentum posterior, brow. The diagnosis of CPD is subjective. However, true CPD may occur if the fetus has a large anomaly \ne.g., teratoma or conjoined twin, or in cases of a large fetus. It can also occur when the maternal \npelvis is small or deformed like after pelvic trauma.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most appropriate management for pregnant women in labour whose fetus is in \noccipitoposterior position is to wait and watch for progress of labour. In a majority of cases, the \nocciput rotates through 3/8th of the circle and the baby is born as occipitoanterior. Hence, when the diagnosis of occipitoposterior is made, labour is allowed to proceed normally \nwhen there are good uterine contractions and favourable pelvis. Indications of caesarean section in occipitoposterior position: • Arrest of labour • Inadequate uterine contraction • Fetal distress • Other obstetrical indications.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The most common complication seen in face to pubis delivery is complete perineal tears. In face to pubis delivery, the occiput is posterior, and therefore, the largest biparietal diameter \n(Ž.4 cm) distends the perineum rather than the smaller bitemporal diameter (8 cm). A liberal \nepisiotomy helps to avoid perineal tears. 259 \nSold by @itachibot Operative Vaginal Delivery",
