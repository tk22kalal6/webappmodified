      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A recurrent tumor with the largest diameter of &lt;3cm is associated with a good prognosis. The extent of recurrent disease and involvement of pelvic lymph nodes are prognostic factors for \nsurvival. An isolated central pelvic tumour with no involvement of the pelvic sidewall also has a \ngood prognosis. Most recurrences are seen within 3 years and the prognosis is poor with uremia being the most \ncommon terminal event. Recurrences most commonly involve the pelvis than the para-aortic or \npelvic lymph node. All patients with a suspected recurrence should undergo PET/CT for evaluation and biopsy for \nconfirmation. Treatment involves either radical chemoradiation or pelvic exenteration. Concurrent \nchemotherapy with cisplatin and/or 5-fluorouracil may improve the outcome.",

      "explanation": "Clinical examination is the first step in staging carcinoma cervix. Clinical examination was the principal method in staging until the 2018 FIGO guidelines which \nrecommended the use of imaging and histological investigations when available. USG, CT, MRI, \nand PET-CT can be used to assess the extent of the tumor, nodal status, and local or systemic \nspread. MRI is the best method to assess the principal tumor while PET-CT is the best method to assess \nnodal metastasis. FIGO no longer mandates biochemical investigations, such as tumor markers, for diagnosis of \nmetastasis. 847 \nSold by @itachibot",
