The most \ncommon cause for hirsutism in female patients is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen-dependent sexual hair or male distribution \nof hair in female patients. PCOS accounts for 70-80% of the cases of hirsutism, which typically \nbegins in late adolescence or the early 20s. Idiopathic hirsutism is the second most frequent cause. The most common rapid onset of \nhirsutism in young females is a testosterone-producing tumour like granulosa cell or \nSertoli-Leydig cell tumours. Other less common causes of hirsutism include: • Late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia • Tumours of the ovary and adrenal gland • Cushing’s syndrome • Drug-induced Virilisation: Characterized by more extensive androgen-induced changes than hirsutism alone. It \nhas the following features: • Acne • Increased oily skin • Temporal balding • Clitoromegaly • Deepening of the voice • Development of male muscular pattern and body habitus • Atrophy of breasts Hypertrichosis: Excessive growth of non-sexual hair.",

It has poorly defined borders, usually occurs in skin fold areas, such as the back of the neck, \naxilla, and groin, and may include thickening of the skin. The pathogenesis of acanthosis nigricans is linked to growth factor levels and insulin-mediated \nactivation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) on keratinocytes and increased growth factor levels. Acanthosis nigricans is usually seen in people younger than 40 years of age and is associated with \nthe following disorders: • Obesity • Hypothyroidism • Acromegaly • Polycystic ovary disease • Insulin-resistant diabetes • Cushing’s disease • Addison’s disease • Gastrointestinal malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas.

      "explanation": "The lesions shown in the image are acne. The drugs used to treat acne and hirsutism in a patient \nwith PCOS are OCPs with cyproterone acetate. The first step in the management of PCOS is weight reduction. OCPs are the drugs of choice for \nregularisation of cycles. They are also the drugs of choice for hirsutism and acne. OCPs used for \nPCOS should contain a 3rd/4th generation progestagen like cyproterone acetate. OCPs induce \nregular menstrual cycles, lower androgen levels and causes thinning of the endometrium. Insulin sensitizers like metformin have been found to improve metabolic and gynecologic issues. \nIt acts by reducing the insulin level and reducing hepatic production of glucose (liver \nneoglycolysis). Other benefits of metformin include improvement in fertility rate and reduction of \nthe total and free testosterone levels. It also increases levels of sex hormone-binding globulin. \nMetformin is contraindicated in hepatic and renal disease. 666 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment of infertility associated with PCOS is done using ovulation-inducing drugs like letrozole \nand clomiphene citrate. If medical management fails, surgical options like laparoscopic ovarian \ndrilling can be considered.

      "explanation": "The image showing enlarged ovaries with multiple large cysts along with the history of treatment \nfor infertility with human menopausal gonadotropin suggests the diagnosis of ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) is a medication that is composed of FSH and LH. It is \nused to stimulate the release of ova in women who do not ovulate spontaneously. It can lead \nto ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a condition associated with ovarian enlargement \ndue to exogenous gonadotropin therapy. Symptoms include abdominal pain, distention, ascites, \ngastrointestinal problems, respiratory compromise, oliguria, and thromboembolism. It can occur \nduring ovulation induction or in early pregnancies conceived through exogenous ovarian \nstimulation. Predisposing factors for OHSS include multi-follicular ovaries (such as in PCOS), young age, high \nestradiol levels during ovulation induction, and pregnancy. Vasoactive substances produced by the corpus luteum, such as vascular endothelial growth factor \n(VEGF) and angiotensin II, are believed to contribute to enhanced capillary \npermeability, resulting in the loss of fluid, protein, and electrolytes into the peritoneal cavity and \nhemoconcentration. Sonographic examination reveals enlarged ovaries with numerous follicular cysts and ascites. Maintaining fluid balance with isotonic fluids like normal saline is crucial. Strategies to prevent \nOHSS during exogenous ovulation include reducing follicular stimulation (low FSH dose), \ncoasting (withholding FSH administration one or more days prior to the hCG trigger), \nprophylactic volume expanders, and substituting hCG for FSH towards the end of ovarian \nstimulation. Other options: Option B: Theca lutein cysts are a rare form of follicular cysts characterized by luteinization and \nhypertrophy of the theca interna layer. Both ovaries are enlarged and cystic. This condition is \ncommonly associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, multifetal gestation, and \nplacentomegaly.
