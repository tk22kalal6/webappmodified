      "explanation": "Obesity in first-degree relatives is not a high-risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. \nHowever, severe obesity is a risk factor for developing gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity with onset \nor first recognition during the present pregnancy. It usually presents in the second or third trimester. More than 50% of women with GDM \nultimately develop overt diabetes within 20 years. It is recommended to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus in the presence of the following \nhigh-risk factors: • Severe obesity • Strong family history of type-2 diabetes • Previous history of gestational diabetes mellitus • Impaired glucose metabolism or glucosuria.",
