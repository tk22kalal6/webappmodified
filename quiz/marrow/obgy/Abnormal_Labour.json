Routine \nepisiotomy is associated with an increased incidence of disruption of anal sphincters and rectal \ntears. Indications of episiotomy: • Shoulder dystocia • Breech delivery • Fetal macrosomia • Operative vaginal deliveries • Persistent occiput posterior positions Methods of prevention of perineal laceration: • Avoid delivery by early extension • Deliver head in between contractions • Perform timely episiotomy when indicated (not routine).",

The most common cause of true CPD in developing countries is vitamin D deficiency and rickets. \nIn developed countries, it is trauma to the pelvis. It occurs due to pelvic dystocia (larger fetus and \nsmaller pelvis). Relative CPD is the most common type of CPD.

False labor can be differentiated from the latent phase of labor by therapeutic rest i.e., the patient \nis sedated with morphine. Augmentation with oxytocin is done only in those patients who even after therapeutic rest \ncontinue to be in prolonged latent phase.

      "explanation": "The best management in the given clinical scenario is cesarean section. Obstructive labor management involves administering intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, \nproviding antibiotics to prevent infection, and promptly performing a cesarean section to relieve \nthe obstruction. If the fetus is alive, an immediate cesarean section is typically performed. \nManagement of obstructed labor never involves a wait-and-watch approach or augmenting with \noxytocin. Clinical features of obstructed labor include maternal exhaustion, dehydration, tachycardia, \ntachypnea, genital sepsis, postpartum hemorrhage, and shock. 214 \nSold by @itachibot On P/A examination the upper uterine segment is tender and tonically contracted. The lower \nuterine segment is thin and stretched. A groove/depression is felt between the upper uterine \nsegment and the lower uterine segment. This is called a Bandls ring.

Caesarean section is the recommended treatment of choice for cord prolapse. Prior to performing \nthe procedure, several measures can be taken to alleviate cord compression. These measures \ninvolve: • Manually elevating the fetal presenting part using two fingers or the entire hand through the \nvagina 215 \nSold by @itachibot • Positioning the patient in steep Trendelenburg, exaggerated Sim's position, or knee-chest \nposition • Filling the bladder with 500–700 cc or more of saline (known as the Vagos method) After the diagnosis of cord prolapse is made, it is crucial not to attempt cord replacement. Such \nattempts are not only ineffective but also result in the inevitable rupture of the membranes, \nleading to cord prolapse.",

      "explanation": "Bandl's ring refers to pathological retraction ring. It is formed in cases of obstructed labour. The upper segment of the uterus contracts and retracts vigourously in an attempt to overcome the \nobstruction while the lower segment dilates. With each contraction there is myometrial shortening so that the actively contracting upper \nsegment becomes progressively thicker and shorter. The passive lower segment is progressively \nstretched and becomes thinner. The junction between the two segments stands out prominently as a pathological retraction ring. 216 \nSold by @itachibot Schroeder's constriction ring is formed due to incordinate uterine action when there is localized \nspastic contraction of a ring of circular muscle fibres of the uterus.

Asynclitism refers to the position of a baby in the uterus such that the head of the baby is \npresenting first and is tilted to the shoulder. This causes the fetal head to no longer be in line with \nthe birth canal. Moderate degrees of asynclitism are the rule in normal labor. However, if severe, this condition is \na common reason for cephalopelvic disproportion even with an otherwise normal sized pelvis. Asynclitism can be of 2 types: • When the sagittal suture lies anteriorly, the posterior parietal bone becomes the leading \npresenting part and is called posterior asynclitism. • When the sagittal suture lies posteriorly, the anterior parietal bone becomes the leading \npresenting part and is called anterior asynclitism.",
