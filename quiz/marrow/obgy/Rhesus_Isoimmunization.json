      "explanation": "The Lewis antigens do not cause alloimmunization or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Alloimmunization/isoimmunisation is defined as an immune response to foreign antigens after \nexposure to genetically different cells or tissues. The Kell blood group system is complex and contains many antigens that are highly \nimmunogenic. These antigens are the third most potent, after those of the ABO and Rh blood \ngroups, at triggering an immune reaction. Anti-Kell causes severe fetal anemia by suppressing \nfetal RBC synthesis. MNS and Kidd blood types cause alloimmunization. Hemolytic disease of newborn is mild with \nKidd whereas MNS causes potentially severe anemia. 525 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The reagent used for the Kleihauer-Betke test is citric acid. Kleihauer-Betke test is the most commonly used quantitative test used to detect fetomaternal \nhemorrhage i.e., the approximate volume of fetal blood entering the maternal circulation. It is \nalso known as the acid elution test. The principle behind it is that fetal erythrocytes contain hemoglobin F, which is more resistant to \nacid elution than hemoglobin A. After exposure to acid, only fetal hemoglobin remains, such that after staining, the fetal \nerythrocytes appear red and adult cells appear as “ghosts.” Fetal cells are counted and expressed \nas a percentage of adult cells. Flow cytometry is the best test for the quantification of fetomaternal hemorrhage. It is more \nsensitive and accurate as compared to the Kleihauer-Betke test. Flow cytometry can analyze a larger number of cells and is not influenced by maternal levels of \nfetal hemoglobin and fetal levels of maternal hemoglobin. It utilizes monoclonal antibodies to \nHbF or to the D antigen followed by quantification by fluorescence.",

The middle cerebral artery is used as other fetal vessels require a larger insonating angle and \nconfers significant measurement error. MCA PSV is enhanced due to increased cardiac output and decreased viscosity of fetal blood, \nwhich permits the reliable, noninvasive detection of fetal anemia in cases of blood-group \nalloimmunization. If the MCA PSV exceeds 1.5 MoM (multiples of the median) and the gestational age is less than 34 \nor 35 weeks, fetal blood sampling should be considered.

      "explanation": "A severely affected fetus is represented by zone 3. Liley developed a chart of changing amniotic fluid bilirubin levels (delta OD450) and weeks \nof gestation. Amnionic fluid bilirubin is measured by a spectrophotometer and is demonstrable as \na change in optical density absorbance at 450 nm (OD450). However, middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PCV) is non-invasive and more \naccurate than optical density at 450 nm, hence Liley’s chart is no longer used in practice. Liley’s chart has three zones as shown below, delineating the severity of rhesus disease. • Liley’s zone I (low zone) - mild disease. • Liley’s zone II (mid zone) - fetal anemia. • Liley’s zone III (high zone) - severely affected fetus and fetal death is imminent.",

If the MCA peak systolic velocity exceeds 1.5 MoM, further evaluation by fetal blood sampling is \nnecessary to assess the need for fetal transfusion. The anemic fetus shunts blood preferentially to the brain to maintain adequate oxygenation. The \nvelocity increases because of increased cardiac output and decreased blood viscosity. In many centers, serial measurement of the peak systolic velocity of the fetal middle cerebral \nartery has replaced amniocentesis for the detection of fetal anemia.

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of maternal mirror syndrome/Ballantyne syndrome. It may be \nconsidered a form of severe pre-eclampsia. Maternal mirror syndrome is the association between fetal hydrops and the development of \nmaternal edema. The syndrome is named as such because the mother mirrors the fetus. It is \ncharacterized by triple edema i.e., the fetus, mother, and placenta become edematous. The pathogenesis of mirror syndrome, although not well established, mimics trophoblastic \ndamage and maternal vascular endothelial dysfunction, as is also seen in pre-eclampsia. Hence, \nthese two conditions may have a similar clinical presentation, with common features such as: • Edema • Hypertension • Proteinuria • Liver enzyme elevation • Headache and visual disturbances. However, in contrast to preeclampsia, the following features are noted in maternal mirror \nsyndrome: • Low maternal hematocrit i.e., hemodilution rather than hemoconcentration • Polyhydramnios rather than oligohydramnios • The fetus always shows signs of hydrops. 530 \nSold by @itachibot The etiology of fetal hydrops is not related to the development of mirror syndrome. Hydrops could \nbe due to rhesus isoimmunization, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, congenital infections, fetal \ncystic hygroma, Ebstein anomaly, sacrococcygeal teratoma, vein of Galen aneurysms, etc. In most cases with mirror syndrome, prompt delivery is indicated, because women with severe \nfeatures of preeclampsia can deteriorate rapidly. In few cases, identification and treatment of the \ncause of fetal hydrops resulted in the resolution of symptoms for both the mother and baby for the \nremainder of the pregnancy.",
