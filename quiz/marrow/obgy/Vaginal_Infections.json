The risk factors for bacterial vaginosis are: 706 \nSold by @itachibot • Oral sex • Vaginal douching • African race • Cigarette smoking • Sex during menses • Intrauterine device • Early age of sexual intercourse • New or multiple sexual partners • Sexual activity with other women Note: Bacterial vaginosis is not an infection. It most commonly affects young women. Although it \nis not a sexually transmitted disease, the chances of developing bacterial vaginosis seem to \nincrease with the number of sexual partners that a woman has had.",

      "explanation": "Vaginal itching is not seen in bacterial vaginosis. It is a symptom of Trichomonas vaginitis. About half of the women having bacterial vaginosis are asymptomatic. Symptomatic women \nmostly present with a profuse, fishy vaginal discharge. It does not cause pruritus, dysuria, and \ndyspareunia. Option A: Bacterial vaginosis occurs due to the absence of lactobacilli. This causes an increase in \nthe growth of other anaerobic bacteria namely Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, and Myco- \nplasma□ hominis. Option B: Amsel's criteria is used for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. 3 out of 4 criteria are needed \nto make a positive diagnosis. Option D: Oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twice \ndaily for 7 days is given for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

These are vaginal epithelial cells \nstudded with adherent coccobacilli at the edge of the cell. Option A: Boer-Miesel's criteria is used for the prognostic evaluation of pelvic inflammatory \ndisease.
