      "explanation": "The fetal ACTH causes an increase in estrogen acting as the onset of labour in pregnant women. It \nresults in the growth of the fetal adrenal gland which has the capacity for steroid biosynthesis i.e. \nestrogen. Daily steroid production of fetal adrenal glands near term is more than in adults.",

Comparison between two types of placental separation methods: Brandt Andrew's method or controlled cord traction is a manoeuvre of expressing the placenta \nfrom the uterus in the third stage of labour. One hand grasps the umbilical cord while the other is placed on the mother's abdomen with the fi \nngers over the anterior surface of the uterus. While the hand on the abdomen is pressed backwar \nds and slightly upward, the other applies gentle traction on the cord. Type III placenta previa is a type of incomplete or partial central placenta previa. Here, the \nplacenta covers the internal os partially i.e. it covers the internal os when closed but does not \nentirely do so when fully dilated. Schultze method \nDuncan method Separation begins from the p \neriphery to the center. Separation begins from the c \nenter of the placenta to the p \neriphery.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The practice of guarding the perineum during delivery of the fetal head is part of the WHO \nmanagement guidelines for the second stage of labor. The fingers of one hand support the perineum, while the second hand applies pressure to the fetal \nhead to control the speed of crowning. The advantage of this is to prevent perineal tears. The second stage of labor begins with full dilatation of the cervix and ends with the delivery of the \nfetus. The main events include the descent of the fetus (bearing down by the mother, uterine \ncontractions), cardinal movements of labor, and delivery of the fetus. Management of the second stage of labor: • The most common position used is the dorsal position with the hips flexed, knees flexed and \nabduction of the thighs. WHO recommends any position of choice including the upright position. • WHO recommendations for the prevention of perineal tears include warm compresses to the \nperineum, perineal massage, guarding the perineum, and modified Ritgen's maneuver. • Modified Ritgen's maneuver: A sterile towel or pad is held in one hand and placed over the \nperineum; the other hand applies gentle downward pressure on the occiput to promote flexion \nand controlled delivery of the head (ensuring the smallest diameter of the head passes through the \noutlet). Once the occiput is born–with gentle pressure, the head is extended–forehead, nose, and \nmouth are then delivered. • WHO doesn't recommend fundal pressure and routine episiotomy. Other options: Option A: A liberal or routine episiotomy is discouraged. Episiotomy is indicated in cases of: • Shoulder dystocia • Breech delivery • Fetal macrosomia • Operative vaginal deliveries • Persistent occiput posterior positions Option C: Manual techniques, such as massage or application of warm compresses, are \nrecommended for healthy pregnant women requesting pain relief during labor. Option D: The position that is most comfortable to the mother i.e. upright/squatting position is \nencouraged.

      "explanation": "True labor pain is not relieved by enema and sedatives. It is characterized by the following: • Painful uterine contractions at regular intervals • The frequency of contractions increases gradually • The intensity and duration of contractions increase progressively • Associated with 'show'- extrusion of the mucus plug that had previously filled the cervical canal \nduring pregnancy • Progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix • Progressive descent of the presenting part • Formation of the 'bag of forewaters' i.e., bulging fluid-filled amniotic membrane presenting in \nfront of the fetal head • Not relieved by enema or sedatives False labour pain is seen more in primigravidae than in parous women. It usually appears prior to \nthe onset of true labor pain by 1 or 2 weeks in primigravidae and by a few days in multiparae. Such pains are probably due to stretching of the cervix and lower uterine segment with \nconsequent irritation of the neighboring ganglia.

      "explanation": "Postdated pregnancy is not an indication for early cord clamping. Early cord clamping is indicated in: • Birth asphyxia • Rh isoimmunization • Diabetic mother The benefits of delayed cord clamping for up to 60 seconds is an increase in total body iron stores, \nexpand blood volume and a decrease in anemia incidence in the neonate. On the other hand, delayed cord clamping can lead to a higher hemoglobin concentration, which \nincreases risks for hyperbilirubinemia and extended hospitalization for neonatal phototherapy. \nDelayed cord clamping can also hinder timely neonatal resuscitation. According to AIIMS Protocols in Neonatology, in uncomplicated preterm birth, delayed cord \nclamping should be attempted. This is done for a minimum time of 60 seconds after delivery for \npreterm infants not requiring immediate resuscitation after birth. It states that DCC must be done \neven if the mother has an HIV infection. But as per the NACO guidelines, early cord clamping is \nadvised. 201 \nSold by @itachibot",

Immediate complications include an extension of the incision into the rectum, vulval hematoma, \nwound dehiscence and injury to anal sphincter. Remote complications include dyspareunia, chances of perineal lacerations in subsequent labor \nand scar endometriosis (rare). Mayo scissors are long and stout scissors. They can be blunt-tipped/pointed tip/straight or curved. \nStraight mayo scissors are designed for cutting body tissues near the surface of a wound. They are \nalso used to cut sutures and are also known as suture-cutting scissors. Curved mayo scissors allow much deeper penetration into the wound and are used to cut thick \ntissues such as those found in the uterus, muscles, breast, and foot. Mayo scissors used for \ndissection are placed in tissue with the tips closed. The scissors are then opened so that the tips \nopen and spread out the tissue during the dissection process. 202 \nSold by @itachibot",
