      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The causative agent of vulval warts is the human papillomavirus (HPV). Genital warts/venereal warts/condyloma acuminata are verrucous growths that affect the skin of \nthe labia majora, perineum, perianal region and vulva. The lesions may be discrete or coalesce to \nform cauliflower-like growth. The disease is sexually transmitted. The growth of the warts is \nfavoured by vaginal discharge, the use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy. HPV causes structural changes in the epithelial cells of the skin called koilocytes, and their \npresence is characteristic of HPV infection. The koilocytes have large hyperchromatic nuclei and a \nperinuclear halo, as shown below. The diagnosis is made by colposcopic studies. The lesions on the vulva are stained by toluidine \nblue. The abnormal areas of the skin retain the blue dye. These areas are then biopsied for \nhistopathological examination. The given image below shows condyloma acuminata: 721 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given image is suggestive of condyloma acuminata that shows cauliflower-like masses of \ntissue on and around the female anogenital region. Condyloma acuminatum is an epidermal manifestation of the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucosa. The virus invades the cells of \nthe epidermal basal layer through microabrasions. However, anogenital HPV infection is almost \nalways acquired through sexual contact. Warts are not required for transmission but are highly infectious because of their high viral load. Option B: The image given below shows shiny, pearly white, umbilicated papules with a \ncharacteristic dimple at the centre. These are seen in molluscum contagiosum caused by the pox \nvirus. 722 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: The image given below shows firm papules with a rough horny surface. These are seen \nin verruca vulgaris caused by the human papillomavirus type 2. Option D: The image given below shows condyloma lata which is the characteristic feature of \nsecondary syphilis. It is caused by Treponema pallidum.",
