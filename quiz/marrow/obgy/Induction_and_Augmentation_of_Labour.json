      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The technique of stimulating uterine contractions prior to the onset of spontaneous labor \nis known as induction of labor. It can be done irrespective of the rupture of membranes. Augmentation is the enhancement of spontaneous contractions that are considered inadequate \nbecause of failed cervical dilation and fetal descent.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The minimum Bishop Score required before proceeding with induction of labour is 6. A Bishop score &gt;8 conveys a high likelihood of a successful induction. The latest guidelines \nstate that a cut-off score of 6 can be used to choose between pharmacological and mechanical \nmethods of induction. This score is calculated based on the: • station of the fetal head • dilation of cervix • cervical length • position of cervix • consistency of the cervix. This score is an important determinant of a successful induction.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Uterine tachysystole is defined as &gt;5 contractions in a 10 min period and may occur in \nspontaneous or stimulated labor. It should always be qualified by the presence or absence of fetal \nheart rate abnormalities. Tachysystole interrupts maternal blood flow to the placenta during \ncontractions and may lead to a reduction in fetal oxygenation. It is also associated with placental \nabruption. It is caused by pharmacological agents used for cervical ripening and induction such as \nmisoprostol (both oral and vaginal) and dinoprostone.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Competitive blocking of acetylcholine is not a mechanism of action of oxytocin. Mechanism of action of oxytocin is as follows: • Receptor mediation through G protein-coupled receptors • Activation of voltage-gated Ca channel leading to calcium entry • Prostaglandin production by a positive feedback mechanism.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Controlled artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) is performed in a patient with amniotic fluid \nindex (AFI)  25 cm. This points towards a diagnosis of polyhydramnios. This is because if ARM is not done under controlled conditions in these patients, it can cause \nsudden decompression of the fetus. This can lead to abruption of placenta.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Stripping of membranes is being depicted in the image, which elicits the Ferguson reflex. It is also \nknown as the fetal ejection reflex and is seen due to the pressure at the internal os of the cervix. It is associated with an increase in blood levels of a prostaglandin F2 metabolite, also known as \ndinoprost. This is released due to mechanical stretching of the internal os. This enhances the \nuterine activity and causes release of more prostaglandins. It is an example of a positive feedback \nmechanism.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The Bishop's score is rapidly improved by the use of laminaria tents. It is a mechanical cervical dilator and acts by hygroscopic osmotic action, leading to slow \ndilatation of the cervix. The gentle dilatation by laminaria tents induces an endogenous synthesis \nof prostaglandins causing a softening of the cervix. This is useful in cervical ripening before \ninduction of labour. 229 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Abdominal amniocentesis followed by oxytocin drip is a safe method for induction of labor in \npolyhydramnios. Abdominal amniocentesis drains a good amount of liquor (amnioreduction), after which the \noxytocin infusion can be started. This will minimize the sudden decompression and reduce the \nrisk of placental separation, cord prolapse and change in lie of the fetus. Although polyhydramnios does not constitute an absolute contraindication for the application of \nprostaglandins, these substances should be administered with caution. There is a marked increase \nin the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and amniotic fluid embolism with their use. \nHence, amnioreduction is a preferred mode of treatment in polyhydramnios.",
