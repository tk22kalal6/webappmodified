      "explanation": "Congenital prolapse is an uncommon cause of prolapse. The most important etiological factors that lead to prolapse are the atonicity of the uterus and \nasthenia, which occurs due to aging and follows menopause. The other factors which lead to prolapse are as follows: • Pregnancy • Vaginal childbirth • Menopause • Aging • Hypoestrogenism • Peripheral nerve injury to the pudendal nerve • Premature bearing down before full dilatation of the cervix • Chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure • Chronic bronchitis • Constipation • Obesity • Spina bifida occulta • Congenital weakness of pelvic floor muscles • Abdominoperineal excision of rectum • Surgeries such as Stamey and Pereyra operation for stress incontinence",

      "explanation": "The most important support of the pelvic viscera is the levator ani muscle. The levator ani forms a \nlarge portion of the pelvic floor. It is composed of three separate paired muscles: • Pubococcygeus • Puborectalis • Iliococcygeus Supports of the genital organs are given by DeLancey's levels of support. However, the broad \nligament is a fold of the peritoneum, which doesn't provide support to pelvic organs.",

In 2nd and 3rd degree uterine prolapse, the supravaginal portion of the cervix gets stretched and \nelongated as it is well supported by the Mackenrodt’s ligaments, while the vaginal portion of the \ncervix prolapses with the vagina. In prolapse, the cervix can elongate to as much as 10cm in \nlength. However, in procidentia, the entire uterus slides with the vagina, and hence the cervix retains its \nnormal length.",

However, retroversion of the uterus does occur with uterine prolapse. Differential diagnoses of genital prolapse include: • Congenital elongation of the cervix - vaginal part of the cervix is elongated. In genital prolapse, \nsupravaginal part is elongated and vaginal part is prolapsed. • Vulval cyst and Gartner cyst - large cysts may mimic prolapse • Cyst of the anterior vaginal wall - tense with well-defined margins and cannot be reduced on \npressure. • Urethral diverticula - rare, small, and situated low in the anterior vaginal wall. Urethroscopy \nhelps in the diagnosis. • Cervical fibroid polyp - cervix remains high up in its anatomical position. 601 \nSold by @itachibot • Chronic inversion of the uterus - Uterine sound is used to confirm the diagnosis.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the clinal scenario of a 55-year-old woman with third-degree uterine prolapse, the ideal \nmanagement is vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair. Uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due to \nlaxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterine \ndescent is clinically categorized into: • First degree: the external os remains above the vaginal introitus 605 \nSold by @itachibot • Second degree: The external os protrudes below the vaginal introitus but the uterine body \nremains inside the vagina • Third degree (Syn: Complete prolapse): The uterine, cervix, body, and fundus descend to lie \noutside the introitus • Procidentia involves prolapse of the uterus with the entire vagina everted. The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower back \ndiscomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms \n(like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexual \ndiscomfort during intercourse. Symptomatic uterine prolapse is managed surgically with different procedures based on the \nprofile of the patient. Conservative management is done for old asymptomatic women with mild \ndegree prolapse. A vaginal hysterectomy is recommended for patients who satisfy the following criteria: • &gt;40 years of age • Have completed their families • Do not wish to preserve menstrual and child-bearing function Other options: Option A: Fothergill repair or Manchester operation is a procedure done to preserve the \nreproductive function and vaginal prolapse with supravaginal cervix elongation. It initially \ninvolves preliminary curettage with low amputation of the cervix. After Mackenrodt's ligament is \nplicated, anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy are performed. Option B: Sling operation (Purandare's operation) is indicated in congenital or nulliparous \nprolapse without cystocele. The procedure involves the extraperitoneal passage of rectus sheath \nstrips joined to the anterior surface of the cervix by silk sutures. Option D: Shirodkar procedure is a type of abdominal sling surgery done in young women to \nretain menstrual and reproductive function. It involves using a sling to fix the cervix to the \nlumbosacral fascia.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows a ring pessary, which is only a palliative treatment for genital prolapse. A ring pessary is used for patients who cannot be surgically managed, such as pregnant patients \nand very elderly women. In these patients, it is used as an adjunct to pelvic floor physiotherapy. Pessaries provide mechanical support to the pelvic organs. After being placed, they should be \nchanged every 3 months. They may cause vaginitis; dyspareunia; and, rarely, carcinoma if \nretained for a long time. The image below shows the types of pessaries: 609 \nSold by @itachibot",

There is some level of descent of the pessary with these maneuvers is to be expected, but the \npessary should return to its normal position when these efforts are stopped. If the pessary \ndescends to the introitus with these maneuvers, then a larger size pessary should be tried. The pessary is well-fitted if you are able to slide the ring of the pessary up and down along the \nvaginal sidewall. It is well-fitted if you are able to insert one finger between the vaginal sidewall \nand the edge of the pessary. When the labia are separated, a well-supported pessary is not usually \nvisible. 610 \nSold by @itachibot The patient should be comfortable, and able to void urine with the pessary in place before leaving \nthe clinic.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pubococcygeus is the deepest part of the levator ani muscle. Injury to it can cause enterocele, \ncystocele, and urethral descent. Levator ani muscles are the most important muscles in the pelvic floor and maintain a constant \nstate of contraction. They provide a stable floor and support the weight of the abdominopelvic \ncontents against intra-abdominal forces. Weakening of levator ani and pelvic fascia from \nstretching or tearing during childbirth, may decrease support for the vagina, bladder, uterus, or \nrectum or alter the position of the neck of the bladder and urethra. The levator ani muscle is a complex unit, which consists of 3 muscle components namely • Pubococcygeus (anterior fibers) • Pubovaginalis - elevates the urethra and hence contributes to urinary continence • Puboperinealis - draws the perineal body towards the pubic symphysis • Puboanalis - elevates the anus and keeps the urogenital hiatus narrowed • Puborectalis (intermediate fibers) • Iliococcygeus (posterior fibers) Origin: The levator ani muscle has a linear origin from the pelvic surface of the body of the pubis, \na tendinous arch of obturator fascia, and the pelvic surface of the ischial spine. Insertion: • The anterior fibres form a sling around the prostate (levator prostatae) or vagina (sphincter \nvaginae) and are inserted into the perineal body (a mass of fibrous tissue) in front of the anal \ncanal. 611 \nSold by @itachibot • The intermediate fibres (puborectalis) form a sling around the anorectal junction to be inserted \ninto the anococcygeal raphe (a fibrous raphe which extends from the anorectal junction to the tip \nof the coccyx). • The posterior fibres (iliococcygeus) are inserted into the anococcygeal raphe and the coccyx. Nerve supply: • perineal branch of 4th sacral nerve (S4) from its pelvic surface. • perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (S2, S3) from its perineal surface. Actions: • The levator ani muscles of two sides together support the pelvic viscera and resist the \nintra-abdominal pressure during straining and expulsive efforts of the anterior abdominal wall \nmuscles. • They also subserve a sphincteric action on the anorectal junction to maintain the continence of \nfaeces in both sexes and vagina in females.
