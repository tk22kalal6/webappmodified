      "explanation": "The image shows Wrigley's forceps, which is a type of outlet forceps. Rotation of the fetal head \nshould not exceed 45 degrees for the application of outlet forceps. This is because it increases the \nrisk of vaginal wall lacerations.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Forceps can be used for delivery of the aftercoming head of breech. The advantages are as follows: • Delivery can be controlled by giving pull directly on the head and the force is not transmitted \nthrough the neck. • Flexion is better maintained. • Mucus can be sucked out from the mouth more effectively. Prerequisites for instrumental vaginal delivery: • Ruptured membranes vertex presentation • Cephalopelvic disproportion not suspected • No fetal coagulopathy or bone demineralization disorder • Completely dilated cervix • Precisely assessed fetal head position • Engaged head • Experienced operator Note: Ventouse can be used for occipitotranverse or posterior position.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Minor scalp abrasions and subgaleal hematomas in newborns are more frequently seen with \nventouse delivery than with forceps delivery. Maternal morbidity is seen more with forceps deliveries and perinatal morbidity is seen more with \nvacuum deliveries. Maternal morbidity seen in operative vaginal deliveries include: • Increased third and fourth-degree vaginal lacerations • Pelvic floor disorders • Postpartum hemorrhage Perinatal morbidity seen in operative vaginal deliveries include: • Vacuum-assisted perinatal injuries: Cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, retinal \nhemorrhage, neonatal jaundice secondary to these hemorrhages, shoulder dystocia, clavicular \nfracture, intracranial hemorrhage, and scalp lacerations. • Forceps-assisted perinatal injuries: Higher rates of facial nerve injury, brachial plexus injury, \ndepressed skull fracture, and corneal abrasion. In cardiac patients, vaginal delivery is preferred. It is conducted with the laboring woman in an \nupright or left decubitus position. Prophylactic use of vacuum is done to cut short the second \nstage of labor. This is to minimize aortocaval compression. Caesarean section is not preferred \nsince it is associated with more blood loss and higher thromboembolic and infection risk. 267 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Deep transverse arrest is an indication for ventouse delivery. In ventouse delivery technique, suction is created within a cup placed on the fetal scalp such that \ntraction on the cup aids fetal expulsion. The important step in ventouse extraction is proper cup \nplacement over the flexion point. The vacuum is gradually created by increasing the suction in increments of 0.2 kg/cm2 every 2 \nminutes until a total negative pressure of 0.8 kg/cm2 is reached. Progressive descent should \naccompany each traction attempt.",

        "d": "On the coronal suture 6 cm away from anterior fontanelle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "An important step in vacuum extraction is proper cup placement over the flexion point. It is a \npoint on the sagittal suture that lies 3 cm in front of the posterior fontanelle. Advantages of correct positioning of cup in vacuum extraction: • Maximum traction • Minimum cup detachment • Twisting of fetal head is avoided • Smallest head diameter is delivered through the pelvic outlet • Success rate is improved • Fetal scalp injury rates are lowered • Perineal trauma is reduced because the smallest fetal head diameter distends the vulva 268 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The maximum negative pressure used in ventouse is 0.8 kg/cm2 Gradual vacuum creation is recommended. This is generated by increasing the suction in \nincrements of 0.2 kg/cm2 every 2 minutes. This is done until a total negative pressure of 0.8 \nkg/cm2 is reached. This slow incremental approach would allow for a more firm attachment of the vacuum cup to the \nfetal head and thereby a lower failure rate.",
