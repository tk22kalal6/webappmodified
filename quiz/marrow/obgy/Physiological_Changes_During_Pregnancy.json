      "explanation": "There is an increase in the metabolism of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium during normal \npregnancy. The changes in the vagina during pregnancy include: • Increased vascularity and hyperemia resulting in a violet/purplish color characteristic of \nChadwick's sign • Vaginal epithelium undergoes marked proliferation (option D) with the extension of the \nsquamocolumnar junction downwards • Vaginal pH decreases and becomes more acidic (option C) and varies from 3.5-6.0. • Increase in the number of Lactobacillus acidophilus (option A). It metabolizes the glycogen \nstores and causes an increased production of lactic acid. Therefore, the pH becomes acidic. • Increased volume of cervical secretion during pregnancy results in the production of thick white \nvaginal discharge.",

      "explanation": "Relaxin is not synthesised by the fetal adrenal gland in a pregnant woman. It is synthesised \nby corpus luteum, decidua and placenta. Relaxin is a placental protein hormone. Plasma levels peak between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation \nand decline thereafter to lower levels that persist until term. Functions of relaxin are: • Relaxation of myometrium and quiescence of early pregnancy • Enhancement of the glomerular filtration rate • Endometrial vascular remodelling by inducing secretion of VEGF",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Among the given features hypothyroidism is not a major physiological change in pregnancy. The  -subunits of hCG and TSH are identical. An increase in hCG during pregnancy stimulates \nthyroid and leads to a decrease in TSH levels. The thyroid undergoes enlargement and boosts the \nproduction of hormones. This is accompanied by increased production of thyroid-binding \nglobulin(TBG). All these changes increase total T4 and T3 in the first trimester. But the \nphysiologically important free T4 and T3 levels remain unchanged. Hence, physiologically \npregnant women remain euthyroid. Option A: Normal pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Human \nplacental lactogen(hPL) secreted during pregnancy, helps in adaptation to fetal energy \nrequirements. Insulin resistance causes prolonged hyperglycemia and glucose flow to the fetus. It \nalso favours protein synthesis. To counterbalance the increased insulin resistance and prevent \nmaternal hyperglycemia, maternal insulin levels are increased. Option B: By the 3rd trimester, there is an increase in the maternal basal metabolic rate by 10 to \n20% in comparison to a nonpregnant woman. Option D: During normal pregnancy, mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance decrease, \nwhile blood volume and cardiac output rate increase. This helps in meeting metabolic demands of \nthe enlarged uterus, provide nutrients to rapidly growing placenta and fetus, safeguard mother \nagainst the effects of parturition-associated blood loss.",

      "explanation": "hCG is not implicated in insulin resistance during pregnancy. 120 \nSold by @itachibot As the fetus is dependant on maternal glucose for sustenance, the blood glucose levels are \nmaintained at a high level in the mother. In response to this, the insulin level in the mother \nincreases, which reduces the maternal blood glucose. To counteract this, the placenta secretes \ncertain hormones which increase insulin resistance in the mother. This resistance is maximal \nbetween 24 to 28 weeks. Hormones increasing insulin resistance include: • Human placental lactogen - Increases lipolysis and liberation of free fatty acids • Progesterone and estrogen • Placental growth hormone - Major determinant of maternal insulin resistance after \nmid-pregnancy • Cortisol • Prolactin",

      "explanation": "Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) occurs most commonly in the third trimester or early \npostpartum period. Risk factors include Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, male fetus, previous history of AFLP, and \nmultiple gestations. AFLP (acute yellow atrophy or acute fatty metamorphosis) is the most common cause of acute \nliver failure in pregnancy. It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in \nthe third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A \ndehydrogenase (LCHAD) or poor placental mitochondrial function. The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastric \npain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, \nand edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure with \nencephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia, \nhypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer is \nseen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration. The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. A trial of labor by \ninduction or delivery by Cesarean is done. Intensive supportive measures including blood \ntransfusion should be provided. The clinical and laboratory findings of acute liver diseases in pregnancy are as follows: The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. Appropriate \nmanagement is immediate termination of pregnancy irrespective of gestational age by induction \nor delivery by Cesarean (for obstetric reasons) is done. Intensive supportive measures including \nblood transfusion should be provided.

      "explanation": "Spotting on the expected date of menstruation in the early months of pregnancy is known as \nplacental sign. Cyclic bleeding may occur up to 12 weeks of pregnancy until the decidual space is obliterated by \nthe fusion of decidua parietalis with decidua capsularis. The bleeding is usually scanty and lasts \nfor a shorter duration than in a regular menstrual cycle. Option A: Slowing of the fetal heart rate (FHR) on pressing the head down into the pelvis is \nsuggestive of placenta previa (especially of posterior type) and is called Stallworthy’s sign. The \nfetal heart rate recovers as soon as the pressure is released. Options C and D: Permanent lengthening of the cord and slight gush of bleeding in 3rd stage of \nlabor are suggestive of separation of the placenta. 126 \nSold by @itachibot Diagnosis of Pregnancy and Antenatal Care",
