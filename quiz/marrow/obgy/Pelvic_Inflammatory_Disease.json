      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The organism seen in the given image of a Pap smear is the Doderlien’s bacillus, also known as \nLactobacillus. This is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacillus that grows in anaerobic conditions. It is a part of the normal vaginal flora that is responsible for the vaginal defence mechanism. It is an estrogen-dependent bacillus and appears at puberty and disappears after menopause. It converts glycogen into lactic acid and maintains the acidic ph in the vagina. This prevents the \ngrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina. Its absence causes a condition called bacterial \nvaginosis where pathogenic organisms replaces the normal flora of the vagina. In this condition, \nclue cells are visible. Option B: Gardnerella vaginalis is the most common organism involved in bacterial vaginosis. As \nthe patient in the given question is healthy, this is not the correct option. Option C: Trichomonas vaginalis is flagellated protozoa that causes trichomonas vaginitis. The \norganism and the nucleus of epithelial cells appear equal in size on the pap smear. This criterion \nis used for the identification of trichomonas as flagella are not visible on a pap smear. Option D: Frisch bacillus is another name for Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is not seen on Pap \nsmears.",

      "explanation": "The mechanism of the spread of gonococci to the tubes in pelvic inflammatory disease is mucosal. Gonococci ascend to the tubes mainly through mucosal continuity. This is facilitated by sexually \ntransmitted vectors such as sperms and Trichomonas. The mucous membranes of the fallopian tubes are affected first. They become edematous and are \ninfiltrated with leukocytes and plasma cells. Another route of spread is through the reflux of \nmucosal blood. Option A: Hematogenous spread is seen in genital tuberculosis. Option B: Lymphatics are involved in the spread of secondary organisms and in PID following \npost-abortal and puerperal infection. Option C: Parametrium facilitates the spread of Mycoplasma. The gut flora can directly spread to \ntubes.",

Hence, the infection goes \nunnoticed and untreated. Thus, it can lead to more damage and complications. Gonococcal infection is more symptomatic than chlamydial infection. Hence, it is diagnosed early \nand causes less damage to the tubes than chlamydial infection.

Presence of \npyoperitoneum mandates laparotomy. • Intestinal obstruction • Suspected intestinal injury as diagnosed in criminal abortion. • Ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess A tubo-ovarian abscess of 2 cm is not an indication for surgery. Minimally invasive surgery is \ndone in a tubo-ovarian abscess measuring more than 10 cm, that fails to respond to antibiotics in \n48-72 hours. Peritonitis and sepsis are not an indication for surgery. They should be managed medically first. If \nthey do not respond to antibiotic treatment then surgical management should be done.",

A radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus, tissue from the sides of the \nuterus, the cervix, and the upper part of the vagina. It is generally done only in cancer patients. A supracervical hysterectomy involves the removal of only the body of the uterus and is not done \nin chronic PID. It is done for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and uterine \nprolapse.",

Boer-Meisel system is specifically used for predicting pregnancy outcomes in patients treated for \nPID. Gainesville has described the stages of PID depending upon the severity of tubal damage. Westrom has reported that women with one previous attack of PID have a predisposition to \nanother attack.

        "c": "It mostly spreads hematogenously",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Long-standing pelvic inflammation may lead to pyometra. This refers to the collection of pus in \nthe uterine cavity. The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands, \nskene glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. Unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may \nbe caused by the inflammation of the Bartholin glands. Depending on the extent of tissue involved, PID can be classified into five stages • Stage I - Acute salpingitis without peritonitis - No adhesions • Stage II - Acute salpingitis with peritonitis - purulent discharge • Stage III - Acute salpingitis with superimposed tubal occlusion or tubo ovarian complex • Stage IV - Ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess • Stage V - Tubercular salpingitis Long-standing pelvic inflammation may also lead to: • Dyspareunia • Infertility • Ectopic pregnancy • Formation of adhesions like hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess • Chronic pelvic pain Note: Chronic pelvic inflammation leads to dense adhesions between the uterus and the \nappendages. Thus, it becomes difficult to define the uterus from the pelvic masses. They form a \nhard mass which is called the frozen pelvis. The most common cause of the spread of PID: Ascending infection along with sperms The only PID that does not spread with the sexual route is genital TB. It has a hematogenous \nspread. The most common PID in virgin females is genital TB. Investigation of choice in PID: Abdominal USG The surest sign of salpingitis is pus extruding from the fimbrial end of the tube. 750 \nSold by @itachibot Genital Tuberculosis",
