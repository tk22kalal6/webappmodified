      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding all over the world is senile endometrial \natrophy. In a menopausal woman, hypoestrogenism causes atrophy of the endometrium and vagina.The \natrophic endometrial surfaces contain little or no fluid to prevent intracavitary friction. This 855 \nSold by @itachibot results in micro-erosions of the surface epithelium and a subsequent chronic inflammatory \nreaction, making the endometrium prone to light bleeding or spotting. Hormone replacement therapy is the second most common cause of post-menopausal bleeding all \nover the world. Cervical cancer is the most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding in India, while \nendometrial cancer is the most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding in developed \ncountries. Note: Endometrial cancer accounts for only 10 % of cases of post-menopausal bleeding. Still, all \npostmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding should be evaluated for endometrial \ncarcinoma, since this is a potentially lethal disease.",

Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia carries 29% risk of developing into endometrial carcinoma \nand hence, must be treated with total abdominal hysterectomy (simple hysterectomy ). 856 \nSold by @itachibot The presence of any concomitant endometrial cancer must be ruled out by doing fractional \ncurettage (or dilatation and curettage) before doing a hysterectomy. If a premenopausal woman does not desire to undergo hysterectomy, progesterone can be given \nand the patient is followed up every 3-6 months.

In this procedure, a balloon catheter is inserted through the cervix and the endometrial cavity is \ndistended with 20-40ml of sterile saline. The balloon is inflated to block the backflow of the \ninfused sterile saline and transvaginal ultrasound is performed to visualize the cavity. It is used: 859 \nSold by @itachibot • To determine the endometrial thickness • To determine the cause in cases of infertility • To identify Mullerian anomalies • To visualize endometrial polyps and pedunculated fibroids The image given below shows the appearance of the uterus on SIS. Option A: Transvaginal ultrasound is the initial evaluation for postmenopausal bleeding.

In a postmenopausal woman, the normal endometrium should not exceed 4 mm in thickness. If it \nexceeds 4 mm, then histopathological examination (HPE) of the endometrium is mandatory, \nirrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms. In a perimenopausal woman, the cutoff for \nnormal endometrial thickness is 10mm. Hysteroscopy and biopsy is preferred over other blind curettage methods for HPE.
