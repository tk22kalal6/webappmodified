      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In the given case scenario, a trial of labor or vaginal delivery can be allowed if the obstetric \nconjugate is 10cm or more. The obstetric conjugate is the shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis \npubis. Normally, it is 10 cm or more. The diagonal conjugate measures 12cm and the true conjugate measures 11cm. Clinically, only the diagonal conjugate is assessed by measuring the distance between the base of \nthe examiner's fingers and the fingertip touching the sacral promontory. This determines \nthe lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory. The obstetric conjugate is estimated \nindirectly by subtracting 1.5–2 cm from the diagonal conjugate. Note: Overt diabetes can cause fetal macrosomia during pregnancy. Thus, it may lead to \ncephalopelvic disproportion. 57 \nSold by @itachibot Given below is an image of the lateral plane in CT pelvimetry, showing the anteroposterior \ndiameters of the pelvis.
