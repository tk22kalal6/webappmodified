Zygosity refers to the type of conception while chorionicity refers to the type of placentation. 313 \nSold by @itachibot Types of twin pregnancies: • Dizygotic: 2 ova are fertilized by 2 sperms to form 2 separate zygotes. • Monozygotic: Single zygote (1 ovum fertilized by 1 sperm) divides into 2.

The genetic relationship between dizygotic twins is the same as any siblings. Option A: More the number of embryos transferred in IVF, more is the risk of twinning. Hence, \nsingle embryo transfer is being recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine \n(2017) to prevent twin gestation.

Superfecundation is the fertilization of two different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as \nsuggested by the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial \nreproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal \nsuperfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins. \nThis leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of \nadultery and infidelity. Superfetation is the fertilization of two ova released in different menstrual cycles. This is not seen \nin humans. The nidation and development of one fetus over another fetus is theoretically possible \nuntil the decidual space is obliterated by 14-16 weeks of pregnancy.",

It can lead to the following outcomes: Factors affecting the prognosis of the surviving twin: • Gestational age at fetal death: 2nd and 3rd trimester deaths increase the risk of morbidity in the \nsurviving twin • Chorionicity: Monochorionic twins with early fetal death have an increased risk of morbidity in \nthe surviving twin. This is due to neurological abnormality and vascular anastomoses. • Duration between fetal demise and delivery of surviving twin • Surviving twin may be born preterm leading to an increased risk of fetal demise Death in the surviving twin occurs mostly due to vascular anastomoses between the twins.

Twin pregnancies should ideally be dated when the crown–rump length (CRL) measurement is \nbetween 45 and 84 mm (i.e. 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation). Chorionicity should be ideally determined between 11 + 0 and 13 + 6 weeks of gestation (the \nearliest time to identify chorionicity is 7 weeks). This is done using the membrane thickness at the \nsite of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta. The T■sign (in monochorionic \ntwins) or lambda sign (in dichorionic twins) can be seen here. As the determination of chorionicity \nis most accurate when the amnion and chorion have not yet been fused, the first■trimester scan \nin twin pregnancy is highly important. Markers of dichorionicity include 4 layers of membranes between the twins, membrane thickness \n&gt;2mm, different sex of twins, 2 different placentas, and positive twin peak sign. Women with an uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancy should have a first■trimester scan, a \ndetailed second■trimester scan, and scans every 4 weeks thereafter.

      "explanation": "The given specimen depicts a monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy as: • 2 umbilical cords are arising from 1 placenta (monochorionic) • No intervening amniotic membrane is attached to the placenta. This means that both fetuses \nmust have been inside a single amniotic cavity (monoamniotic). Option B: In Monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, on gross examination, there will be 1 placenta \nand intervening 2 layers of amnion attached to the placenta. In this type of pregnancy, each fetus \nwill have its own amniotic cavity (diamniotic) with a shared placenta (monochorionic). This is \nseen if the fertilized zygote divides into 2 between 4-8 days. The below given gross image of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy shows two umbilical cords \narising separately from the placenta with the intervening amniotic membrane held by the forceps. 327 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: In dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy each fetus has it’s own amnion &amp; chorion. \nThe placentas here may be fused or separate. This is seen in dizygotic twins as well as \nmonozygotic twins that divide within 0-4 days. Option A: Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) most commonly complicates \nmonochorionic (single placenta) twin pregnancy. In TTTS blood is transfused from the donor twin \nto the recipient twin through the abnormal vascular connections within the placenta leaving the \ndonor anemic while the recipient becomes polycythemic.

Timing of delivery depends on the type of twin pregnancy: The mode of delivery depends on the 1st twin: After delivery of 1st twin, if the 2nd twin is in breech, assisted breech delivery is done.
