      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The second most common pathological cause of anemia during pregnancy is anemia associated \nwith chronic disease. The most common pathological cause of anemia during pregnancy is iron \ndeficiency anemia. Women with chronic disorders may develop anemia for the first time during pregnancy. Causes \ninclude: • Chronic renal insufficiency - the most common cause. Recombinant erythropoietin is used for \ntreating anemia due to chronic renal failure. • Inflammatory bowel disease • Connective tissue disorders • Granulomatous infections • Malignant neoplasms • Rheumatoid arthritis • Chronic suppurative conditions. Note: The most common cause of anemia in pregnancy is physiological. It is normally seen during \npregnancy. This occurs due to the expansion of plasma volume by 30–40%. This increase is much \nmore than the increase in red cell mass (20-30%) during pregnancy. This leads \nto hemodilution and an apparent decrease in hemoglobin levels.",

      "question": "Question 3: What is the average maternal requirement of iron during a singleton pregnancy?",
      "options": {
        "a": "300 mg",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Maternal requirement of iron during a singleton gestation averages close to 1000 mg. The average iron stores in a non-pregnant female is around 300 mg. This falls short of the \nrequirement of iron during pregnancy which is 1000 mg. Hence iron supplementation is \nnecessary to prevent iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. This also forms the basis for \nprophylactic iron supplementation during pregnancy. Note: The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (FOGSI) states that the iron requirement in \npregnancy is 840 mg, as about 160 mg of iron is saved due to amenorrhea during pregnancy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The amount of folic acid to be given to pregnant women suffering from sickle cell anemia is 5 mg. This is to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and to compensate for the increased demand for \nfolate during pregnancy. Normally in all sickle cell patients (irrespective of age or sex), 1mg of folic acid is given to prevent \nfolate deficiency. Note: William's Obstetrics 26th Edition mentions folic acid 4 mg daily for pregnant women with \nsickle cell disease. However various other sources and RCOG guidelines mention it as 5 mg daily. \nHence this is the best answer.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, history suggestive of restless leg syndrome and Hb of 10.1g/dL points to a \ndiagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive indicator of iron \ndeficiency anemia in pregnant women. This is because its concentrations are not affected by the recent intake of iron-rich foods. Serum \nferritin concentration &lt;15 g/L indicates iron deficiency anemia. However, treatment needs to be initiated when the concentration falls &lt;30 g/L, as this \nindicates early iron depletion. Restless leg syndrome also called Willis-Ekbom Disease, causes unpleasant or uncomfortable \nsensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them. It may be associated with iron \ndeficiency anemia. 461 \nSold by @itachibot",

Since \nthe anemia was diagnosed late in pregnancy, the most appropriate treatment is parenteral iron \ntherapy. Ferrous sucrose is a form of parenteral iron given as an IV infusion. If anemia is diagnosed: • In the first trimester - Oral iron therapy is preferred • In the second trimester - Oral iron therapy should be switched over to parenteral iron if Hb falls \n&lt;8g/dl or if serum ferritin is &lt;15ng/ml • In the third trimester - Parenteral iron therapy is preferred 462 \nSold by @itachibot Ferrous sucrose is the most commonly used preparation for IV infusion.
