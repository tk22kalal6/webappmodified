      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in vaginal delivery is defined as a blood loss of more than 500 \nml after completion of the third stage of labour. In Caesarean section, blood loss of more than 1000 mL from the genital tract is called PPH. Depending upon the amount of blood loss, PPH can be: • Minor (&lt;1L) • Major (&gt;1L) • Severe (&gt;2L) In most cases, the magnitude of haemorrhage cannot be assessed accurately as visual estimates \nare unreliable. Note: as per the latest ACOG guidelines, PPH is defined as cumulative blood loss 1000 mL or \nbleeding associated with hypovolaemia in the first 24 hours after birth, irrespective of the route of \ndelivery. It is added that despite the new definition, blood loss &gt;500 mL in a vaginal delivery \nshould raise suspicion and mandates further evaluation.",

The suture bites are taken over the lower uterine segment anteriorly. Then it is looped over the \nfundus to go posterior. Another bite is taken posteriorly. Then it is looped back over the fundus \nand taken anteriorly. The final bite is taken over the lower uterine segment and the free ends are \ntied in a surgical knot.

      "question": "Question 21: In a patient with hydramnios complicating pregnancy, the third stage of labour was managed \nby applying fundal pressure and controlled traction of the cord. On palpation, the uterus was \nstill soft and boggy. Within a few minutes, there was moderate bleeding per vaginum \nfollowing which a reddish-purple mass was expelled.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis is uterine inversion. Hydramnios is a risk factor for uterine inversion due to uterine over-distension. Fundal pressure \nwhile the uterus is atonic (soft, relaxed, and boggy) causes uterine inversion. It results in \nhaemorrhage followed by complete uterine inversion protruding out of the vulva. Neurogenic type \nof shock develops due to stretching of the infundibulopelvic ligament and the ovaries. Option A: Amniotic fluid embolism causes cardiac arrest, acute hypoxia and severe haemorrhage. Option B: There was only moderate bleeding per vaginum and soft uterus. But since there is \nprotrusion of the uterus per vaginum, the most probable diagnosis is uterine inversion. Option D: Placenta accreta rarely causes uterine inversion. Uterine inversion is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication in the 3rd stage of labor, \nin which the uterus is turned inside out partially or completely. Causes: • Most common cause is mismanagement of 3rd stage of labour 414 \nSold by @itachibot • Spontaneous • Placenta accreta (rarely) Features: • Shock immediately after delivery • The degree of shock is out of proportion to the amount of bleeding • Shock is either neurogenic or hemorrhagic • Per abdomen examination - fundus of the uterus is not palpable.
