As the period of gestation has \nexceeded 32 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated. In case of absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF), the waves just touch the baseline, but don't appear \nbelow it.

Option A: Gestational sac is reliably seen at 5 weeks of gestation on transvaginal \nsonography(TVS). Option C: The first sign of pregnancy seen on sonography is the gestational sac.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Nuchal translucency evaluation, a component of first-trimester aneuploidy screening, is done \nbetween 11-14 weeks. It represents the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and \nsoft tissue, overlying the fetal spine, at the back of the neck. When the nuchal translucency is \nincreased, the risk of fetal aneuploidy and structural anomalies such as heart defects is \nsignificantly elevated. First trimester aneuploidy screening combines two maternal serum analytes and a sonographic \nmeasurement: • Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 168 \nSold by @itachibot • Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) • Nuchal translucency (NT) It is performed between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. In cases of fetal Down syndrome, the \nfirst-trimester serum-free -hCG level is higher and the PAPP-A level is lower. With trisomy 18 \nand trisomy 13, levels of both analytes are lower. Note: Nuchal fold is a normal fold of skin seen at the back of the fetal neck during the second \ntrimester of pregnancy. Increased nuchal fold thickness is associated with fetal aneuploidy.",

Lemon sign: Axial USG image of the fetal head at the level of the biparietal diameter shows \ninward concavity of both frontal bones instead of the normally seen convexity.

      "explanation": "170 \nSold by @itachibot The given ultrasound image shows an open defect in the calvaria and skin leading to the exposure \nof the cranial neural tube. This is consistent with the diagnosis of anencephaly. Anencephaly results from incomplete closure of the neural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable \ncongenital defects that can be detected as early as 10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Screening can also \nbe done by serum estimation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). The following are the \nradiological signs seen in anencephaly. • Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, prominent orbits thereby resembling the face of a \nfrog. • Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganized \nmass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap giving rise to a characteristic triangular facial \nappearance. Neural-tube defects can be prevented with pre-conceptional supplementation of folic acid. A dose \nof 4 mg daily is recommended in subsequent pregnancies. The frog eye and showercap signs are shown below: 171 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid \nabdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a \nsac. Given below is an ultrasound image of the fetus suggestive of an omphalocele (asterix). Cystic hygroma is a congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that is classically found in the left \nposterior triangle of the neck. It occurs as a result of sequestration or obstruction of developing \nlymph vessels. This defect can be picked up in a first-trimester ultrasound. The images below \nshow the MRI and USG appearance of cystic hygroma, respectively: 172 \nSold by @itachibot Encephalocele is caused due to defects in the skull through which the meninges and/or neural \ntissue herniate.
