      "explanation": "Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or into the genital tract after 28 \nweeks of gestation up to the delivery of the baby. The lower limit is the period of viability and the \nupper limit includes the 1st and 2nd stages of labour. Causes of APH: • Placental causes: • Abruptio placenta (most common) • Placenta previa (2nd most common) • Circumvallate placenta • Circummarginate placenta • Fetal causes: • Vasa previa • Extraplacental causes (local cervicovaginal lesions): • Local trauma • Varicose veins • Cervical polyp 379 \nSold by @itachibot • Carcinoma cervix. Note: According to RCOG criteria, the lower limit for APH is 24 weeks. However, in India, the \nperiod of viability is 28 weeks, so it is taken as the lower limit for APH.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of antepartum haemorrhage (APH) due to placenta previa \n(painless bleeding PV). The next step in the management is to confirm the diagnosis with \ntransvaginal ultrasound (TVS) as the patient is stable. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is used to detect the cause of APH. If the placenta is in the lower uterine segment on TAS, confirmation of placenta previa is done by \nTVS. TVS provides a clearer image of the relationship between the edge of the placenta and the \ninternal cervical os than TAS. Approach to placenta previa after confirmation with TVS: • Minor placenta previa - repeat USG at 36 weeks • Major placenta previa or accreta - USG at 32 weeks followed by elective caesarean delivery • Bleeding present - individual management On TAS, if the placenta is in the upper uterine segment with evidence of retroplacental blood clot, \nabruptio placenta is suspected. Per vaginal examination in placenta previa must not be done as it may further separate the \nplacenta and cause excessive bleeding. However, transvaginal ultrasound is safe as long as the \nprobe is 2-3 cm away from the cervix.",

      "explanation": "The antenatal diagnosis of vasa previa can be done by colour doppler. Vasa previa is a condition where fetal vessels travel within the membranes and overlie the cervical \nos. Hence, there can be bleeding during cervical dilatation or membrane rupture. Fetal mortality is high due to fetal exsanguination. Investigations of vasa previa: • Colour flow Doppler (TVS) • Singer's alkali denaturation test - to detect nucleated red blood cells • Apt test - to detect fetal haemoglobin Management of vasa previa: • No bleeding • 28-32 weeks - antenatal corticosteroids • 30-34 weeks - admission for surveillance • 37 weeks - elective caesarean section • Bleeding present • Emergency caesarean section done by category I Options A and B: Colour Doppler is superior to MRI and TAS in the antenatal diagnosis of vasa \nprevia. Option D: Singer's alkali denaturation test to detect fetal RBCs can be used in intrapartum \ndiagnosis of vasa previa (as there might be bleeding).",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of vasa previa since bleeding is associated with fetal \ndistress and sinusoidal pattern in NST. Actively bleeding vasa previa in a term gestation is \nmanaged by immediate LSCS. Sinusoidal pattern in CTG is a regular, smooth, undulating signal resembling a sine wave. It can \nbe seen in conditions associated with severe fetal anemia like: • Anti-D allo-immunisation • Fetal-maternal haemorrhage • Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome • Ruptured vasa previa • Acute fetal hypoxia • Infection 390 \nSold by @itachibot • Cardiac malformations • Hydrocephalus • Gastroschisis Sinusoidal pattern on CTG: Management of vasa previa: • No bleeding • 28-32 weeks - antenatal corticosteroids • 30-34 weeks - admission for surveillance • 37 weeks - elective caesarean section • Bleeding present • Emergency caesarean section Note: Vagos method is used in the management of umbilical cord prolapse.",
