The vulva is posteriorly related to the perineum. The triangular space bounded by clitoris, labia minora and fourchette is the vestibule. It is present \nbetween the labia minora anteriorly and the introitus posteriorly. The posterior part of the \nvestibule between the fourchette and the vaginal introitus is called fossa navicularis.

      "explanation": "The round ligament terminates at the anterior end of the labia majora. The labia majora lie on either side of the vulva and join posteriorly to form the posterior \ncommissure. The inner side is hairless. Labia majora are homologous to the scrotum in males. \nThe labia majora and the mons veneris contain: • Hair follicles • Sebaceous glands • Modified sweat glands, known as apocrine glands The labia minora are two cutaneous folds between the labia major. Anteriorly they enclose the \nclitoris and unite with each other in front and behind the clitoris to form prepuce and frenulum \nrespectively. The labia minora are homologous to the ventral aspect of the penis. The clitoris is a small erectile body lying in the anterior-most part of the vulva. The clitoris is \nhomologous to glans penis. 14 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given image shows a Bartholin's cyst, which involves the Bartholin's glands. These glands are \nhomologous to the male bulbourethral or Cowper glands. The ducts of Bartholin's glands open in the groove between the hymen and the labia minora at \napproximately 5 and 7 o’clock positions. They are stimulated by sexual arousal. The glands \ncontain columnar cells that secrete mucus with lubricant properties. Contraction of the \nbulbospongiosus muscle expresses gland secretions. Bartholin's cyst occurs due to obstruction of the ducts of the Bartholin's glands by proteinaceous \nmaterial, or due to infection. Symptomatic or recurrent cysts may require marsupialization or \ngland excision. An infected Bartholin's cyst can lead to an Bartholin's abscess. This requires \nsurgical drainage. 15 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The pH of the vagina before puberty is 7. In adult females, the pH is acidic. Doderlein's bacilli (Lactobacillus sp.) are part of the normal vaginal flora. They produce lactic \nacid from glycogen in the vaginal epithelium and make the vaginal pH acidic. They are present in \nnewborns and disappear in 10-14 days. They reappear at puberty and disappear after menopause. \nVaginal flora also includes microbes such as Clostridium welchii. Vaginal defence mechanisms are influenced by estrogen. In newborns, maternal estrogens \nmaintain the defence mechanisms for 10-14 days. After that, the levels wane. During puberty, the \ncirculating estrogen maintains the defence mechanism. Note: The pH is higher in the upper part of the vagina due to mixing with alkaline cervical mucus.

Structure of the ovary: • Surface epithelium - a single layer of cuboidal cells is present, which later gives rise to the \nsurface epithelium of the adult ovary. It is morphologically continuous with the mesothelium of \nthe peritoneum. 26 \nSold by @itachibot • The subepithelial connective tissue layer - gives rise to the tunica albuginea of the adult ovary \nand the basement membrane beneath the surface epithelium. • The parenchymatous zone - becomes the cortex and contains the egg nests and ovarian follicles. • Zona vasculosa - becomes the medulla and contains the blood vessels. Hilar cells present here \nare homologous to interstitial cells of testes. They can rarely produce hilar cell tumors of the \novary.",

The ovarian plexus is a network of nerves comprising: • Postganglionic sympathetic fibres • Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the sacral outflow (S2-S4) • Visceral afferent fibres (responsible for transmitting sensory signals) The ovarian plexus has two parts based on its connections: • Upper part: Derived from branches of the renal plexus and aortic plexus • Lower part: Derived from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses.",

Once the retropubic space is dissected, the bladder neck and the vaginal fascia underneath are \nidentified. The bladder is mobilized to the opposite side. At each side of the bladder neck, two to \nfour, preferably non■absorbable sutures are placed in the space of Retzius. Note:The presacral space is a retroperitoneal space that lies between the peritoneum of the \nposterior abdominal wall and the sacrum. It contains the superior and inferior hypogastric \nplexuses. The sacral sympathetic trunk lies against the sacrum’s ventral surface. 31 \nSold by @itachibot The Physiology of Conception",
