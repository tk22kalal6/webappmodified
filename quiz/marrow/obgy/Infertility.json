      "explanation": "The accepted minimum period of sexual cohabitation to establish the diagnosis of infertility in a \ncouple is one year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Infertility is an apparent failure of a couple to conceive while sterility is an absolute inability to \nconceive. Infertility is of two types: • Primary infertility - when there have been no previous pregnancies. • Secondary infertility - when there has been a prior pregnancy (although not necessarily a live \nbirth).",

      "explanation": "Artificial insemination with donor semen is done in cases of infertility where the husband has \nazoospermia. Azoospermia is defined as a complete absence of sperms. Hence artificial insemination with the \nhusband's/partner's semen cannot be performed. Indications for artificial insemination with husband's/partner's semen are: • Chronic medical disorder • Oligospermia after sperm washout • Impotence • Premature and retrograde ejaculation • Hypospadias • Antisperm antibodies in cervical mucus • Unexplained infertility- direct intraperitoneal insemination (DIPI) is done • HIV-positive male or female • X-Y fractionation of sperms for sex selection in cases of genetic and chromosomal abnormalities Indications for artificial insemination with donor semen are: • Azoospermia • Uncorrectable immunological factors • Genetic disease in husband/partner • Chronic ill health Sperms can be frozen and used later for artificial insemination e.g. if the husband requires to \nundergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or if the husband is a frequent traveler and is not \navailable at the time of ovulation. Artificial insemination techniques include: • Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) 772 \nSold by @itachibot • Intrafallopian-tube Insemination • Intracervical Insemination • Direct Intraperitoneal Insemination (DIPI) Steps required to do artificial insemination are: • The semen is washed to remove abnormal sperms, debris, and seminal plasma containing \nantibodies. It is concentrated, and its quality is improved by the 'swim up technique' or by the use \nof the Percoll gradient. • Semen with normal sperms and good motility is obtained. • Around the time of ovulation, semen obtained is inseminated into the female genital tract.

Ovarian reserve is the capacity of the ovary to produce eggs. FSH levels are measured in the early \nfollicular phase on day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle. A high FSH level indicates that the ovarian reserve is getting depleted and fewer oocytes are \npresent in the ovary. FSH is high in ovarian hypofunction and postmenopausal women. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a better marker than FSH for ovarian reserve. Unlike FSH, its \nlevels can be estimated at any time of the cycle. AMH is produced by the granulosa cells in ovarian \nfollicles. Note: Studies show that AMH levels decrease under the current use of oral contraceptive pills and \ntobacco smoking.",

AMH is also used in assessing \novarian reserve. In women, AMH is always absent during embryogenesis and is secreted by the granulosa cells \nafter puberty. It helps in follicular development and oocyte maturation. Estimation of serum AMH \nis used in the study of ovarian reserve in female infertility and secondary amenorrhoea. In men, AMH starts to be secreted by the Sertoli cells in the testes by the 7th week of intrauterine \nlife. It continues until puberty. It inhibits the development of the Müllerian system.

      "explanation": "Fertiloscopy helps in obtaining a good view of the posterior surface (and not the anterior surface) \nof the ovary and genital organs. This is an advantage of fertiloscopy over laparoscopy. The other advantages of fertiloscopy over laparoscopy are: 781 \nSold by @itachibot • The Trendelenburg position is not needed. The procedure can be done in a lithotomy position • Trauma can be avoided as no trocar is needed • No CO2: Hydroperitoneum with saline • Peritoneal spill can be seen Fertiloscopy is a new mini-invasive diagnostic technique that allows the visualization of the \nposterior pelvis. In this technique, an optical device is introduced into the pouch of Douglas, \nthrough the posterior vaginal fornix, under general/local anaesthesia. It can also be used for small interventions, such as adhesiolysis, ovarian drilling, coagulation of \nendometriosis spots and to perform chromosalpingoscopy and salpingoscopy. With fertiloscopy, \nsurgical intervention can be avoided and it is a good alternative to diagnostic laparoscopy. The image given below is of a fertiloscope.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the next step in management will be hysteroscopy and \nlaparoscopy-guided surgery. Tubal contractions, particularly cornual spasms, can give an incorrect impression of proximal \nfallopian tube obstruction (a false-positive result) on hysterosalpingography. Laparoscopy with \nchromotubation is therefore considered to confirm the diagnosis of cornual spasm. Laparoscopy is \nboth diagnostic and therapeutic in this condition. Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure that provides an endoscopic view of the endometrial \ncavity and tubal ostia via the cervix, performed in the preovulatory phase. It can \nbe diagnostic or therapeutic. It is the gold standard investigation for visualizing the uterine cavity \nand tubal ostia. Contraindications to hysteroscopy are as follows: • Acute genital tract infection (Eg: genital herpes infection) 782 \nSold by @itachibot • Viable intrauterine pregnancy • During menstruation, the view is obscured, and the infection rate is high. • Scarred uterus and enlarged uterus of size  12 weeks are relative contraindications. • Cervical stenosis can cause cervical tears and uterine perforation. • Cardiopulmonary disorder due to increased risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. • Known cases of cervical cancer Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the evaluation of tubal factors in infertility, commonly done \nin the proliferative phase. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic. Benefits of laparoscopic evaluation: • Tubes: For detection of tubal patency, block (site and side), motility, hydrosalpinx change, \nperitubal adhesions, fimbrial agglutination • Ovaries: PCOS changes, endometriosis, PID, adhesions • Uterus: Anomalies, fibroids • Peritoneal factors: Adhesions, PID, endometriosis, tuberculosis • Therapy at the same sitting (as appropriate) Diagnosticindications of hyst \neroscopy Therapeuticindications of hys \nteroscopy To study the endocervical mu \ncosal liningCongenital malfor \nmations of the uterusEndom \netrial tuberculosisMisplaced I \nUCDEndometrial lesionsEnd \nometrial polypAsherman syn \ndromeCornual tubal blockage Uterine septumAsherman sy \nndromeRetained IUCDPolyp \nectomySubmucous fibroidAb \nnormal uterine bleedingTuba \nl sterilization using sclerosin \ng agents Diagnostic \nTherapeutic (Operative) Unexplained infertilityRecon \nstructive tubal surgeryAdhesi \nolysisFulguration of endomet \nriotic implantsOvarian drillin \ng in PCOSGIFT and ZIFT pro \ncedures Age >35 yearsHistory of pelvi \nc pain, dyspareunia, pelvic su \nrgery, adhesionsAbnormal H \nSGFailure to conceive after a \nreasonable period (6 months) \nwith normal HSGWomen wi \nth comorbid pelvic pathology \n(PID, endometriosis)",

Exogenous gonadotropins such as hMG are given to such \npatients. Timed administration of hCG is needed to induce ovulation after the follicle has \nmatured. The human menopausal gonadotropin is an extract of urine from postmenopausal women. It \ncontains FSH and LH in the required ratio for follicular growth. Clomiphene, letrozole, and GnRH analogs stimulate the release of gonadotropins from the \npituitary gland. These are not helpful in a patient whose pituitary gland has been removed. 784 \nSold by @itachibot Perimenopause, Menopause and Post-Menopausal Bleeding",
