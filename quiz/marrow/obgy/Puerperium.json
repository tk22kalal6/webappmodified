      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome. Sheehan's syndrome (SS) is postpartum hypopituitarism secondary to the necrosis of the pituitary \ngland. It usually results from severe hypotension or shock caused by massive hemorrhage during \nor after delivery. Patients with SS have varying degrees of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. \nThe hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary, which occurs normally during pregnancy, increases \nthe risk of infarction. Affected women may have persistent hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and lactation \nfailure. The most prominent symptoms are lactation failure (due to a deficiency of \nprolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to a deficiency of gonadotropins). Because \ndeficiencies of some or all pituitary-responsive hormones may develop after the initial insult, \nSheehan syndrome can be heterogeneous and may not be identified for years. It can present acutely as pituitary apoplexy, an endocrine emergency, characterized by a sudden \nonset of headache, nausea, visual deficits, and in severe cases, \nsevere hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, CNS hemorrhage, and death. Also, it can present late with the following features: • Loss of pubic and axillary hair • Hypothyroidism due to decreased TSH secretion • Adrenal insufficiency due to low ACTH Treatment is by hormone replacement - first glucocorticoids, later - thyroid hormone, sex steroids, \nvasopressin and growth hormones are given. If there is evidence of progressive visual loss, cranial \nnerve involvement or loss of consciousness, immediate surgical decompression must be carried \nout. Fertility can be achieved in these women with hMG and hCG. Clomiphene is ineffective. Option B: Rotor syndrome is a type of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia with autosomal recessive \ninheritance. Affected individuals have mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. Option C: Prolactinoma or pituitary adenoids is the condition of hyperprolactinemia diagnosed by \na prolactin level &gt;200 g/L. It usually presents with infertility, amenorrhea, and galactorrhea. Option D: Acromegaly is characterized by the signs and symptoms pertaining to excessive growth \nhormone secretion.",
