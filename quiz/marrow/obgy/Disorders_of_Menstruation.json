      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Primary amenorrhoea is seen in Turner syndrome Amenorrhoea is a symptom and not a disease entity. It refers to the absence of menstruation that \ncan be physiological or pathological. Primary amenorrhea is defined as an absence of menstruation by the age of 15 years. At age 13 \nyears, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexual \ncharacteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should \nbegin. Mullerian agenesis (MRKH syndrome), androgen insensitivity syndrome, and Turner \nsyndrome present with primary amenorrhea. In Turner's syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis causes \nprimary ovarian failure, resulting in hypogonadism and amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for 3 or more months or fewer than 9 \ncycles per year after the establishment of regular menstrual cycles. Polycystic ovarian syndrome \nand hypothyroidism are associated with secondary amenorrhea. Pregnancy is the most common \nphysiological cause of secondary amenorrhea.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The absence of withdrawal bleeding after the estrogen-progesterone challenge test points towards \na local endometrial lesion. Estrogen–progesterone challenge test is indicated as an investigation in case of secondary \namenorrhea. It depends on estrogen-primed endometrium being present in the uterus. Procedure: • Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg or conjugated equine estrogen 1.25 mg is to be taken daily for 25 days. • Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily is added from day 15–25. • Alternately, one course of oral contraceptive pill is given and to observe whether withdrawal \nbleeding occurs or not. Results: • If there is no bleeding, a local endometrial lesion is present such as uterine synechiae. This is to \nbe confirmed by HSG or hysteroscopy. • If withdrawal bleeding occurs, the endometrium is responsive but the endogenous estrogen \nproduction is inadequate. Hence, the defect lies in the ovary, hypothalamus, or pituitary. 560 \nSold by @itachibot",

Pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, \nand molar pregnancies may present with AUB, hence these need to be ruled out by urine \n-hCG levels. This is done for all women in the reproductive age group.
