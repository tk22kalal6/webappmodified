      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The risk of post-partum haemorrhage does not increase in post-term pregnancy. Complications of post-term pregnancy are due to placental insufficiency and placental ageing. It \nmanifests as placental infarcts and calcifications. During post-term pregnancy, diminished \nplacental function can cause oligohydramnios. Complications of post-term pregnancy are: • During labour: • Fetal hypoxia • Labour dysfunction • Macrosomia • Shoulder dystocia • Oligohydramnios • Cord compression • Birth trauma • Meconium aspiration • Following birth: • Chemical pneumonitis, atelectasis, pulmonary hypertension (due to meconium aspiration) • Hypoxia • Hypoglycemia 433 \nSold by @itachibot • Polycythemia • Neonatal convulsions",
