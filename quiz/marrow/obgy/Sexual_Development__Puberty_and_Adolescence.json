      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The sex of the fetus is determined by Yp11, which is a region present on the short arm of the Y \nchromosome. It contains the SRY gene, which produces the protein called the testis determining factor. This \ncauses the gonads to develop into the testes. The target gene for SRY which favours testis \ndifferentiation is SOX9. If SRY gene or Y chromosome are absent, the gonads develop as ovaries. The genes that favor this \nare: • WnT4 • Rspo • DAX1",

However, male and female morphological characteristics begin \ndeveloping after the 7th week. At the end of the 6th week of development, it is impossible to \ndistinguish between the two sexes.",

Hysterosalpingography (HSG) provides excellent information about the interior contour of the \nuterine cavity. However, it doesn't show the external contour, so it cannot distinguish between \nuterine anomalies such as didelphys, bicornuate, septate or arcuate uteruses. Transvaginal 3-D ultrasonography (3D TV-US) is very accurate for the diagnosis and \ndifferentiation of uterine anomalies. It is the first and only mandatory step in the assessment of \nthe uterine cavity in patients with a suspected uterine anomaly. Pelvic MRI without contrast provides excellent delineation of both internal and external uterine \ncontours. It should be reserved for patients in whom 3D TV-US is not possible.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Ultrasonography (USG) is performed to confirm a diagnosis of uterus didelphys. Uterine didelphis is a congenital condition that occurs when the incomplete fusion of Mullerian \nducts that form the uterus during embryonic development leads to the development of two \nseparate uterine cavities and two cervices, each with its own set of endometrial lining. It is commonly associated with renal anomalies such as unilateral renal agenesis, severe renal \nhypoplasia, etc, and is often associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labour, \nmalpresentation, and prematurity. 3D ultrasound, a non-invasive test, visualizes both the external (serosal) and internal \n(endometrial) uterine contours, effectively identifying anomalies. Hysterosalpingography (Option \nC) shows only the internal contour, making it unable to distinguish between conditions like \ndidelphys, bicornuate, septate, or arcuate uterus. 98 \nSold by @itachibot The USG findings in didelphys uterus are two widely separated uterine horns and a deep fundal \nindentation. çaparoscopy and hysteroscopy, being invasive diagnostic procedures, should be reserved for cases \nwhere simultaneous surgical treatment is planned following a comprehensive non-invasive \nassessment of a Mullerian anomaly. (Option A) Intravenous pyelography is used to diagnose congenital renal anomalies. (Option B)",

Hence, it \ndoesn't scar the uterus and avoids the necessity of cesarean sections for future pregnancies \nimproving obstetric outcomes. Metroplasty is the surgical resection of the intrauterine septum.

The order of changes in puberty are: • Thelarche - It refers to breast budding, and is the first visible sign. It indicates the competency of \nthe hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of an imperforate hymen, which has led to \ncryptomenorrhoea. This is a condition where menstruation occurs but is not visible due to an \nobstruction of the outflow tract. The menstrual fluid gets collected in the reproductive tract. When this collection occurs in the \nvagina, it is known as hematocolpos. If the collection extends to the uterus, it is known as \nhematometra. The collection of blood in the fallopian tubes is called hematosalpinx. The most common causes of cryptomenorrhea are: • Intact/imperforate hymen - a bluish convex bulge is seen. • Transverse vaginal septum - a pinkish concave covering is seen Ultrasound pelvis confirms the diagnosis. Management: Imperforate hymen - A simple cruciate incision of the hymen allows the free drainage of the \ncollected menstrual blood, and leads to normal reproductive function. 106 \nSold by @itachibot Transverse vaginal septum - Extensive dissection and vaginoplasty is required. Option A: Bartholin's cyst appears as a swelling on the inner side of the labia majora. çarger cysts \ncan bulge across the introitus. Small cysts can remain asymptomatic. Option D: Endometriomas are endometriotic lesions seen on the ovary. They present as adnexal \nmasses. Endometriosis is a complication in cryptomenorrhea, due to retrograde menstruation.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of gonadal dysgenesis. Hence, the patient will have high \nçH and FSH levels as it is a condition of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Gonadal dysgenesis is the most frequent cause of premature ovarian failure. In this disorder, a \nnormal complement of germ cells is present in the early fetal ovary. However, oocytes undergo \naccelerated atresia, and the ovary is replaced by a fibrous streak. This is called a streak gonad. There are two types of gonadal dysgenesis: 1. Pure gonadal dysgenesis: • ˜aryotypes seen: • 46 XX is seen in pure gonadal dysgenesis due to FSH gene mutation. • 46 XY - Swyer syndrome • Associated with primary amenorrhoea • They are phenotypically female due to: • Absence of testosterone • Absence of Anti-Mullerian hormone secretion by testes • The underdeveloped gonad ultimately fails, which is indicated by elevated gonadotropin (çH, \nFSH) levels • The presence of a Y chromosome can result in a germ cell tumor in the dysgenetic gonad • Treatment: • Hormone replacement therapy - with estrogen and progesterone • Infertility - Pregnancy can occur with a donated ovum è. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis: • ˜aryotypes seen: • 45 X0 - e.g. Turner's syndrome • 46 XX • 46 XY • Mosaicism • Dysgenetic gonad can develop into a germ cell tumor. 107 \nSold by @itachibot",

Serum prolactin is high. • çH and FSH (gonadotropins) levels are high, as sex-steroid feedback is absent.
