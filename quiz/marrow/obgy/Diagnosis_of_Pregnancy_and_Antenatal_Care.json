The concept of fourth trimester was introduced to address common concerns raised by women in \npuerperium such as post-partum pain, breastfeeding related problems, stress and postpartum \ndepression, and lack of awareness of newborn care. The components of postpartum care for the \n4th trimester include: • Dedicated care team • Lactation support • Infant feeding plan • Reproductive life plan 133 \nSold by @itachibot • Contraception • Addressing complications of pregnancy • Assessment of cardiovascular risk • Mental health assessment • Chronic health conditions ACOG recommendation for postpartum visits: • Initial visit: 3 weeks postpartum • Final visit: 12 weeks postpartum Government of India recommendation for postpartum visits. • First visit: 1st day after delivery • Second visit: 3rd day after delivery • Third visit: 7th day after delivery • Fourth visit: 6 weeks after delivery",

      "explanation": "The ideal number of antenatal visits is 12-14. The antenatal visits should ideally be: monthly once up to 28 weeks, once in two weeks between \n28-36 weeks, and once weekly visits from 36 weeks onwards. This translates to a total of 12-15 visits. The WHO increased the minimum number of antenatal visits from 4 to 8 visits to reduce \nperinatal mortality. In the Indian scenario, the earlier minimum of 4 visits were implemented as follows: • 1st visit: within 12 weeks (preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected) • 2nd visit: between 14-26 weeks • 3rd visit: between 28-34 weeks • 4th visit: between 36 weeks and term A booked case is one that has at least 3 antenatal visits with two visits in the third trimester.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "As per Naegele’s rule, the EDD (expected date of delivery) of this woman is October 16, 2017. Naegele’s rule states that EDD is obtained by adding 7 days and subtracting 3 months from the \nLMP (the 1st day of the last menstrual period). Another method is adding 9 months and 7 \ndays to LMP. Less than 5% of births follow Naegele's rule. It is based on a 28-day regular cycle. If the cycle is shorter/longer than 28 days, corrected EDD is \ncalculated as follows: • For a 35-day cycle, add another 7 (35-28=7) days to the calculated EDD to get the corrected \nEDD. • For a 25-day cycle, subtract 3 (28-25=3) days from the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. Naegele’s rule cannot be followed in IVF pregnancies. Considering the human embryo takes 266 \ndays to develop, EDD is calculated in IVF pregnancies by the following method: • Same day as fertilization (day 0): EDD = date of transfer + 266 days • 3 days after fertilization (day 3): EDD = date of transfer + 263 days • 5 days after fertilization (day 5): EDD = date of transfer + 261 days",

      "explanation": "The pregnant lady can continue the same diet since there are no additional calorie requirements \nin the first trimester. Pregnancy requires an additional 80,000 kcal, mostly during the last 20 weeks. To meet this \ndemand, a caloric increase of 100 to 300 kcal/d is recommended during pregnancy. This greater \nintake, however, should not be divided equally during the course of pregnancy. The Institute of \nMedicine (2006) recommends adding 0, 340, and 452 kcal/d to the estimated nonpregnant energy \nrequirements in the first, second, and third trimesters respectively. Whenever caloric intake is inadequate, protein is metabolized rather than being spared for its vital \nrole in fetal growth and development.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical case, the patient should be advised to continue the pregnancy. The radiation dose to the fetus during the declared term of pregnancy should be less than 1 \nmSv. In chest X-ray PA view, the absorbed dose of radiation by the fetus is less than 0.1 mSv. \nHence, pregnancy can be continued. An X-ray has a very limited role in obstetric imaging. There are very few indications where an \nX-ray will be useful: • Fetal: congenital malformation of the fetus and neonates, skeletal malformations, birth injuries \nlike fractures or dislocations. • Maternal: Patients having cardiopulmonary disease may require an X-ray chest during \npregnancy and that should be done beyond 12 weeks. Radiation can cause fetal morbidity (FGR, genetic mutations, neurologic abnormalities, mental \nretardation, childhood leukemia) and mortality. The risks are high with radiation after the first 2 \nweeks postconception and within the first trimester (period of organogenesis). Radiation during pregnancy can damage the early phase of the embryo but the risk can be \nminimized by using the ‘10-day rule’. This rule states that no woman should be exposed to an \nX-ray for a nonurgent indication outside 10 days from her last period during the reproductive \nperiod unless the pregnancy is excluded. The given table below shows the absorbed radiation by the fetus in different diagnostic radiation \nprocedures: 1 cGy = 10 mSv 137 \nSold by @itachibot Procedure \nDose (c \nGy) 0.1-0.3 Abdominal X-ra \ny Pelvic X-ray \n0.5-1.1 Chest X-ray \n<0.001 Abdominal CT \n0.4-0.8 Chest CT \n0.002-0. \n02 2.5-3.5 Abdominopelvic CT Ventilation scan \n0.007-0. \n05 PET scan \n1-1.5",

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is detectable in the plasma of pregnant women as early as \n7-8 days after conception by radioimmunoassay. It doubles every 2 days and reaches a maximum \nlevel at 9 weeks. Thereafter, it declines to reach the lower level at 20 weeks and disappears from \ncirculation 2 weeks postpartum. Increased levels of beta-hCG are found in: • Multiple preganancies • Rh isoimmunization • Down's syndrome • Choriocarcinoma • Hydatidiform mole Decreased levels of beta-hCG are found in: • Ectopic pregnancies • Impending spontaneous abortion 143 \nSold by @itachibot • Missed abortion • Edward syndrome.",
