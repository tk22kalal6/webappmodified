      "explanation": "Obstetric cholestasis is a condition in which cholestasis occurs in pregnancy. Serum bilirubin \nincreases very late in the disease and total plasma concentrations rarely exceed 5 mg/dL. Hyperbilirubinemia results from the retention of conjugated pigment. It is also referred to as recurrent jaundice of pregnancy, cholestatic hepatosis, and icterus \ngravidarum. There is a significant genetic influence. It may be more common in multifetal \npregnancies. Patients present with pruritus that develops usually during the third trimester, typically involving \nthe palms and soles. It is worse at night. Icterus may also be present. 541 \nSold by @itachibot Bilirubin (mg/d \nL) Disorder \nAST (SGOT) \nU/L Cholestasis of pregnancy \nUp to 200 \n1–5 Acute fatty liver of pregnancy \n200–800 \n4–10 Hepatitis \n2000+ \n5–20",

Serum cholic acid is preferred compared to serum chenodeoxycholic acid. Although serum bile acid increases after meals it is still considered an important investigation \namong women with obstetric cholestasis.

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of obstetric cholestasis. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the drug of choice \nin obstetric cholestasis. It relieves pruritus, lowers bile acid and serum enzyme levels (like SGOT, ALP). It may also reduce \ncertain neonatal complications such as preterm birth, fetal distress, and respiratory distress \nsyndrome. Antihistamines and topical emollients may provide some relief. Cholestyramine causes decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, which leads to vitamin K \ndeficiency.

AFLP is a rare, potentially fatal complication also known as acute fatty metamorphosis or acute \nyellow atrophy. It is more common in the third trimester.

It is also associated with: • First pregnancy - uncommon in subsequent pregnancies • Maternal obesity • Multiple pregnancies Investigations: • Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. • Hemolysis with coagulopathy: • Decreased platelets and fibrinogen • Elevated d-dimers and prothrombin time • Biopsy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration. The definitive management of AFLP is rapid delivery of the fetus and supportive care. Hepatic \ndysfunction usually normalizes within a week of delivery. 543 \nSold by @itachibot",

Asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to persistent, actively multiplying bacteria within the urinary \ntract in asymptomatic women. Organisms that cause urinary infections are those from the normal perineal flora. The most \ncommon causative agent is E.coli. Others include Klebsiella, and Proteus. Incidence is similar to that in non-pregnant women. Prevalence depends on parity (more in higher \nparity), race, socioeconomic status (more in low SES). It is more common in patients with sickle cell anemia/trait, diabetes. There is a high risk of \ndeveloping chronic renal lesions in later life. It is also associated with: • Hypertension • Anemia • Premature labor • Intrauterine growth retardation • Urinary tract abnormalities in recurrent cases.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The risk of developing fetal varicella syndrome (congenital varicella syndrome) is highest when \nthe mother develops varicella infection between 13 to 20 weeks. Congenital varicella syndrome occurs in 2% of infants with maternal varicella between 13 and 20 \nweeks of gestation and in 0.4% of infants before 13 weeks of gestation. It is rare after 20 weeks. Congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by cicatricial skin scarring in a zoster-like pattern \n(zig-zag scarring), and limb hypoplasia (shown below). They can also present with neurological \nabnormalities (microcephaly, cortical atrophy, mental retardation), ophthalmic features \n(chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataract), and renal and autonomic system abnormalities \n(hydronephrosis, neurogenic bladder). Low birth weight is also common. Infants born to mothers with varicella in the period from 5 days prior to delivery up to 2 days \nafter delivery are at high risk for severe neonatal varicella. They acquire the infection \ntransplacentally. Since the mother has not developed a strong antibody response, the infant lacks the protective \neffect of maternal anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies. Therefore varicella-zoster immune \nglobulin (VZIG) should be administered as soon as possible after birth to newborns whose \nmothers have varicella 5 days before and up to 2 days after the delivery. Since perinatally acquired varicella can be potentially life-threatening, the infant should typically \nbe treated with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) when lesions appear. For pregnant women with uncomplicated primary varicella or herpes zoster that does not require \nhospitalization, the recommended treatment is oral acyclovir (800 mg five times daily for seven \ndays). 548 \nSold by @itachibot",

The ideal contraceptive in a breastfeeding mother with a seizure disorder is depot \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), as progestins increase the seizure threshold. 553 \nSold by @itachibot Disorders of Menstruation",
