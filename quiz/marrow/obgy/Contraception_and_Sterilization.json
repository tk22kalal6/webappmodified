      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Anencephaly is not seen in the case of accidental conception in a woman using the rhythm \nmethod. It occurs due to deficiency of folic acid in the mother. The calendar method or the rhythm method is one of the natural methods of contraception by \nfertility awareness. The couple is advised avoidance of sexual intercourse around ovulation. Thus, \nit is very cost-effective but it can only be used by educated couples. According to this method, safe period in a normal 28-day cycle is from the 1st day of menstrual \nperiod to the 10th day and from the 18th to the 28th day. An alternate method is by calculating \nthe risk period i.e., 3 days before and 3 days after ovulation. Ovulation can also be estimated by \nchanges in cervical mucus and basal body temperature. Another method of calculating the safe period is the Knaus–Ogino method. The fertile period is \ndetermined by subtracting 18 days from the shortest cycle and 10 days from the longest cycle. \nThis gives the first and the last day of the fertile period, respectively.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Billing’s method of contraception refers to the cervical mucus method. It is also called ovulation \nmethod. The properties of the cervical mucus change during the menstrual cycle. The female partner can \npredict the fertile period by examining her cervical mucus. Under the influence of estrogen, the mucus increases in quantity and becomes more slippery and \nelastic i.e. wet days. This continues till it reaches a peak. After this, under the influence of \nprogesterone, it becomes thicker, scanty i.e. dry days. Abstinence is advised during the wet days till 4 days after the peak day. The safe period includes \nthe dry days after menses till the appearance of mucus and from the 4th day after the peak day. The pattern of cervical mucus secretion during a menstrual cycle is given below. 679 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Minipills or progesterone-only pills (POP) do not kill sperm in the cervical canal. \nProgesterone-only pills act by thickening the cervical mucus (the main mechanism of all POPs 684 \nSold by @itachibot except cerazette) that inhibits penetration of sperms, inhibiting tubal motility, and suppressing \novulation. Other advantages of POPs include a reduction in the incidence of pelvic inflammatory diseases \nand sexually transmitted diseases (due to thickened cervical mucus). Due to the inhibition of tubal motility, the absolute risk of all pregnancies including ectopic \npregnancy decreases, while the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy increases. But a previous history \nof ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication for POP. POPs do not affect clotting, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. So they can safely be \nused by women who are obese, breastfeeding, hypertensive, have SLE or a history of \nthromboembolism, diabetic with vascular disease. Significant adverse effects of POPs are irregular \nbleeding (mostly scanty), and secondary amenorrhea after longtime usage as it causes endometrial \natrophy.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Essure permanent device is a method of hysteroscopic sterilization. Pomeroy, Parkland, and \nIrving procedures are methods for tubal ligation via an abdominal approach. Essure device consists of a micro-inserter with a flexible inner coil made of stainless steel and a \ndynamic outer coil made of nickel titanium alloy (nitinol). This device is inserted into the fallopian tube by hysteroscopy. It acts by benign local fibrous \ntissue growth leading to occlusion of the tube. The failure rate is 3.5%. Its advantages are that there is no abdominal scar and the procedure can be done under local \nanaesthesia. Disadvantages of Essure: • Hysteroscopy required for the procedure and to confirm the blockage • Expensive procedure • Expertise required • Irreversible - tuboplasty for reversal not possible • 3 months waiting time to ensure sterility - HSG must be done after 3 months to confirm tubal \nblockage • Bilateral insertion difficult due to spasm • Can cause perforation of the tube 692 \nSold by @itachibot",

This is \nthe most commonly used technique. Uchida's method - The tubal serosa is stripped off the muscular layer in the midsegment of the \ntube. The muscle layer is excised. The proximal end is ligated and buried in the broad ligament. \nThis minimal excision of the tube preserves the potential for tuboplasty. 694 \nSold by @itachibot Irving's procedure - The mid-portion of the tube is ligated and the intervening portion is excised. \nThe proximal end is buried in the myometrium and the distal end is buried in the broad ligament. \nIt is a reliable method but irreversible and may require a laparotomy incision.

      "explanation": "The failure rate of vasectomy is 0.15% This procedure is done under local anaesthesia. A small incision is made in the scrotum. The vas \ndeferens are divided on both sides which disrupts the passage of sperms. The no-scalpel technique has been now adopted. One single incision is made with special forceps \nand skin stitch is not required. Clips and plugs can be applied over the vas instead of cutting. The sperms can remain in the reproductive tract for up to 3 months. Hence, sterility is not \nimmediate. The couple must abstain from intercourse during this period or use other methods of \ncontraception. Approximately, 20 ejaculates clear the semen of all sperms. Two semen analysis reports must \nconfirm the absence of sperms before the man can be declared sterile. 696 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Levonorgestrel (LNG) 1.5 mg i.e. 2 tablets of LNG 0.75 mg can be used as a single dose emergency \ncontraceptive. This should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, one tablet of LNG 0.75mg can be followed by another tablet 12 hours later. The \ntablets can be offered up to 120 hours but the efficacy decreases with the increase in interval \nbetween coitus and drug intake. LNG prevents ovulation and makes endometrium unsuitable for implantation. The failure rate is \n1.1%.
