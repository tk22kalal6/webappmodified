      "explanation": "A placental cotyledon is comprised of portions of the basal plate divided by clefts. It is the \nfunctional unit of the placenta. A placental cotyledon or placental lobule constitutes one truncal or main stem villi and its \nramifications (rami). Each lobule is supplied by a single truncal branch of the chorionic artery. \nEach lobule also has a single vein. The lobules constitute functional units of placental \narchitecture. The fetal surface is the chorionic plate. The umbilical cord inserts in the center of the chorionic \nplate. Note: The entire placenta is supplied by chorionic villi while each cotyledon is only supplied by a \nsingle main stem villus with its branches. 75 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Maternal leucopenia is not seen in pregnancy, instead leucocytosis is seen. This plays no part in \nthe prevention of rejection of fetus. The fetus is a semiallogenic graft inside the maternal body as half of its genes are from the father. \nUterine transplantation immunity contributes to the survival of the fetus in spite of it being \nsemiallogenic. This occurs due to the following factors: • Decidual natural killer cells are inefficient, and therefore are unable to attack the 'foreign' fetal \ncells. • Decidual stromal cells work with natural killer cells to allow trophoblastic invasion. • Villous trophoblastic cells don't express HLA antigens and therefore, they are non-immunogenic. 76 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) does not cause involution of the corpus luteum, but it \nmaintains corpus luteum function. hCG is produced by the syncitiotrophoblasts of the placenta. It is a glycoprotein hormone with \ntwo subunits. The alpha-subunit is similar to LH, FSH and TSH. The beta-subunit is specific and \nis measured by pregnancy tests. hCG can be detected in maternal blood 8 days after fertilisation. Thus, it can help in diagnosis of \npregnancy even before the period is missed. Its levels nearly doubles every 48 hours in early \npregnancy reaching a maximum of 50000 - 100000 IU/L by 60-70 days of gestation.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of polyhydramnios associated with respiratory distress. In \nsuch cases, therapeutic amniocentesis termed amnioreduction is done. Amnioreduction helps in polyhydramnios by: • Relieving respiratory distress by reducing mechanical pressure on the diaphragm • May improve obstructive uropathy • May lower the preterm delivery risk if the patient has preterm labor or premature rupture of \nmembranes Option A: Diuretics have no role in this condition. Option B: Indomethacin therapy used to be given earlier as it reduced amnionic fluid volume. \nHowever, it is not given anymore due to the risk of premature closure of ductus arteriosus. 85 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) is avoided as: • It cannot be employed in a patient with an unfavourable cervix. • Once ARM is done, delivery needs to be performed. In this case, preterm delivery would occur, \nhence ARM is avoided. • ARM should be used with caution in patients with chronic polyhydramnios. It can lead to \nsudden decompression of the uterus causing placental abruption. Thus, controlled ARM is done in \nthese patients.",

It is associated with congenital \nanomalies such as genitourinary and cardiac anomalies. 86 \nSold by @itachibot The umbilical cord is a tube that connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains umbilical vessels \nand an obliterated allantois duct, all surrounded by Wharton's jelly and contained within an outer \nlayer of amnion. Maternal blood enters the fetus through the umbilical vein, and blood exits the \nfetus via the two umbilical arteries. Wharton's jelly is a gelatinous mucopolysaccharide that \nprotects the umbilical vessels. Local collections of Wharton's jelly produce false knots in the cord. The average length of the umbilical cord is between 40-70 cm at term. A long cord can form a loop \naround the fetus' neck and can cause asphyxia. A short cord can result in cord rupture during \nlabor.",
