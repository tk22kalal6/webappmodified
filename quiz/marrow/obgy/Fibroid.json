      "explanation": "Fibroids are more common in African-American women. Uterine fibroids are benign, smooth muscle tumors present in the uterine musculature. They are \nmost commonly seen during reproductive years. Estrogen and progesterone promote the \ndevelopment of fibroids. Option B: Hypoestrogenism occurs in smokers, therefore smoking is protective for fibroids. Option C: Estrogen exposure is increased in nulliparous women, therefore fibroids are more \ncommon. Increased parity is protective for fibroids. Option D: Most fibroids do not increase in size during pregnancy. Pregnancy can have an \nunpredictable effect on fibroids based on individual genetic and environmental factors.",

The hyperestrogenic environment is created by the following mechanisms: • Compared to normal myometrium, leiomyoma cells contain a greater density of estrogen \nreceptors, which results in greater estradiol binding. • These tumors convert less estradiol to the weaker estrone. • There are higher levels of cytochrome P450 aromatase in leiomyomas compared with normal \nmyocytes.

Leiomyoma is the most common benign and the most common pelvic tumor in females and is \nmore common in obese females(hyper-estrogenism). They are mostly asymptomatic and the most \ncommon symptom is menorrhagia. Leiomyomas can also present with bleeding areas, cystic degeneration, and calcifications.

The image below different types of uterine fibroids classified according to their locations: Sub-mucous fibroids are the most symptomatic type and intra-mural fibroids are the most \ncommon type of uterine fibroids. Other options: Option B: Endometrial cancer presents as a polypoid mass protruding into the uterine cavity or as \na diffuse thickening of the endometrium. The cut surface may appear white to yellow and may \nshow areas of necrosis or hemorrhage. Option C: Endometrial polyps are usually small and may be single or multiple. Grossly, they \nappear as soft, red to pink, often pedunculated (attached by a stalk) masses protruding into the \nuterine cavity.

Metrorrhagia in a woman over 40 years warrants a dilatation and curettage procedure to rule out \nendometrial cancer. This is associated with fibroids in 3% of cases. Polymenorrhoea in a patient with fibroids occurs when she has polycystic ovaries or pelvic \ninflammatory disease (PID). Progressive menorrhagia is seen in intramural and submucous myoma due to increased \nvascularity, endometrial hyperplasia, and an enlarged uterine cavity. Note: Further the distance of the fibroid from the cavity, lesser is the possibility of menorrhagia. \nFor this reason, subserous and pedunculated fibroids do not cause menorrhagia.",

Uterine artery embolization/Uterine fibroid embolization (UAE/UFE) is an angiographic \ninterventional procedure that delivers polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) microspheres or other synthetic \nparticulate emboli into both uterine arteries thus producing ischemia and necrosis. The vessels \nserving leiomyomas have a larger caliber, hence these microspheres are preferentially directed to \nthe tumors, thus sparing the surrounding myometrium. 636 \nSold by @itachibot Nd:YAG myolysis is laparoscopic myolysis performed with an Nd:YAG laser. It causes coagulation \nof a subserous fibroid. The below image shows uterine artery embolization. Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) is also called MR-guided \nhigh-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU). Ultrasound energy is focused to heat and incite coagulative necrosis in selected myomas. \nConcurrent MR imaging enables precise targeting and provides real-time tissue temperature \nfeedback to limit surrounding thermal injury.
