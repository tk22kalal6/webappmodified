It is a period of 3–4 years before menopause and is associated with mild ovarian hormonal \ndeficiency leading to menstrual disorders, especially menorrhagia. The climacteric phase is the phase of waning of ovarian activity. It begins 2 to 3 years before \nmenopause and may continue 2-5 years after menopause. It marks the transition from active to \ninactive ovarian function and involves physical, sexual, and psychological adjustments. 790 \nSold by @itachibot The predictors of approaching menopause include: • A fall in the level of inhibin B and a corresponding rise in FSH level • A fall in the level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) - This is a better marker of ovarian reserve \nand can be tested on any day of the cycle.",

The \nvagina appears pale, dry, and may show petechiae. Treatment of atrophic vaginitis involves topical estrogens in the form of creams, tablets, or rings. \nEstrogen replacement restores vaginal mucosal elasticity, vaginal fluid secretion levels, blood flow, \nand sensorimotor responses.

Endometrial polyps are soft, fleshy growths within the uterus that consist of endometrial glands, \nfibrous stroma, and surface epithelium. Risk factors for endometrial polyps include increasing \nage, obesity, and tamoxifen use. They are usually asymptomatic. When symptomatic, they present with heavy menstrual bleeding, \nprolonged bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, or infertility. The main diagnostic tools for endometrial polyps include transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) with \napplied color Doppler, saline infusion sonography, and hysteroscopy. The risk factors for the malignant transformation include postmenopausal status, age older than \n60, and abnormal bleeding. Other factors such as larger polyp size (&gt;1.5 cm), tamoxifen use, \ndiabetes, and obesity may also contribute to a higher risk.

Normal saline and lactated Ringer solutions are commonly used isotonic, electrolyte-containing \nfluids in operating rooms for diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures. These solutions can cause \nvolume overload and, if rapidly absorbed in large volumes, may lead to pulmonary edema. Isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids are contraindicated for use with monopolar electrosurgical \ndevices because they conduct electrical current, dissipate instrument energy and render the \ninstrument ineffective. Low-viscosity, electrolyte-poor fluids such as 1.5-percent glycine, 3-percent \nsorbitol, and 5-percent mannitol are preferred as they are non-conductive and can be safely used \nwith monopolar electrosurgical energy devices. The primary risk of using hypotonic, hypoosmolar solutions is the intravascular absorption of \nthese fluids, which can lead to acute hyponatremia and hypo osmolality. The criteria for terminating the procedure for electrolyte-deficient fluid is a deficit of 1 L and \nelectrolyte-rich fluid is a deficit of 2.5 L. 796 \nSold by @itachibot Ovarian Tumors",
