Meig’s syndrome is characterized by a triad of: • Benign ovarian tumors • Ascites • Right-sided pleural effusion. The pleural effusions are usually right-sided, even though the left-sided and bilateral effusions are \npossible. Tumors causing Meigs' syndrome include ovarian fibroma, granulosa cell tumor, Brenner tumor, \nor thecoma. However, when the causative factor is ovarian secondaries, leiomyoma, and benign ovarian cysts \n(such as teratoma and mucinous cystadenoma), the condition is called Pseudo Meigs' syndrome. Resolution of ascites and pleural effusion is seen after the removal of the tumor. Management: • Repeated paracentesis for ascites. • Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in young patients for preserving fertility 808 \nSold by @itachibot • Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) in \npostmenopausal women.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical entity characterized by diffuse intra-abdominal \ngelatinous and mucoid material on peritoneal surfaces. Spontaneous perforation of a mucinous 809 \nSold by @itachibot cystadenoma leads to implantation of low-grade malignant tumor cells in the peritoneum.

Dermoid cyst is the most common germ cell tumor. It is also the most common benign tumor of \nthe ovary in the reproductive age group and in pregnancy. It is bilateral in 10-15% of cases. Dermoid cyst is derived from all three germ cell layers, but ectodermal derivatives are most \ncommon. Rokitansky’s protuberance is the most common site for the development of malignancy. \nIt is seen as a projection covered by skin, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, teeth, and bones. \nSometimes thyroid tissue can be seen on histopathological examination, known as struma ovarii.

Grading of ovarian cancer: • Grade 1 - well-differentiated cancers have cells that closely resemble normal cells and are less \nlikely to spread or recur. • Grade 2 - moderately differentiated cancer cells. • Grade 3 - poorly differentiated cancers show increasing abnormality of appearance compared to \nnormal cells. They are also more likely to spread and recur.",
