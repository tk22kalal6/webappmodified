      "explanation": "Condyloma acuminata is the common differential diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma. It refers to anogenital warts and has a verrucous appearance. Verrucous carcinoma is a variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. It is locally invasive \nand rarely metastasizes. Condyloma lata is a benign and painless cutaneous manifestation of secondary syphilis. It is \ncharacterized by gray to white lesions, typically located in the oro-genital region. Chancre is a painless genital ulcer most commonly formed during the primary stage of syphilis.",

      "explanation": "Among the given gynecological malignancies, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is most useful in \nvulval carcinomas. This is because women with earlier stages of vulval cancer can have diseased lymph nodes even \nwithout palpable enlargement of nodes. Hence, sentinel lymph node biopsy helps in early \ndiagnosis lymph node spread which can be managed by lymph node dissection. A sentinel lymph node is a physiologically, the first lymph node to receive tumor lymphatic \ndrainage. Malignancies where sentinel lymph node biopsy is commonly done are : • Vulval carcinoma • Breast carcinoma 826 \nSold by @itachibot • Penile carcinoma • Malignant melanoma Lymphatic mapping is similar technique to SLNB that can also be used in vulval cancers.",
