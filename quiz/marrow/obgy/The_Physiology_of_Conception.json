      "explanation": "Germ cells appear in the yolk sac in the 3rd week. The sequence of events in primordial germ cell formation and migration are: • 2nd week - Germ cells are formed in the epiblast. • 3rd week - Germ cells move through the primitive streak and migrate to the wall of the yolk sac. • 4th week - Germ cells begin to migrate from the yolk sac to gonads. • 5th week - Germ cell migration is complete. Gametes are derived from these primordial germ cells.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The ovary contains the maximum number of oogonia at the 5th month of intrauterine life. The \nnumber of oogonia is estimated to be 7 million. Oogenesis is the process wherein oogonia differentiate into mature oocytes. It begins before birth. \nAt birth, there are approximately 2 million primordial follicles. At the initiation of puberty, the \nfollicle count is less than 400,000, of which less than 500 are destined to ovulate. Every month, \n15–20 follicles are released, out of which one matures to form the ovum.",

      "question": "Question 3: A man with oligospermia has completed his course of hormonal treatment. After how many \ndays will you test his sperm count?",

        "a": "50-60 days",

        "d": "70-80 days"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The sperm count is tested 80-90 days after hormonal treatment, as the average time is taken for \nspermatogenesis is 74 days, and approximately 14 days to reach the ejaculatory ducts. The effect of hormonal therapy on the early phase of spermatogenesis is reflected in the ejaculated \nsperm concentration after three months. Spermatogenesis is the process of the formation of sperms from spermatogonia. Approximately \n100 million sperms are produced daily. In patients diagnosed with oligospermia, hormonal treatment is carried out using FSH, hCG, or \ntestosterone. Improvements in sperm count can take a few months, hence the course is usually for \n3-6 months. Normal spermatogenesis occurs after this time period. Spermiogenesis refers to the series of changes that occur in the formation of spermatozoa from \nspermatids. These are: • Acrosome formation 38 \nSold by @itachibot • Condensation of the nucleus • Formation of the neck, middle piece, and tail • Shedding of cytoplasm as residual bodies Complete motility is obtained in the epididymis.",

      "explanation": "The time taken for the capacitation of sperms is 6-8 hours (approximately 7 hours). Sperms have to undergo two changes in the female reproductive tract to be able to fertilise the \novum: 1) Capacitation • It is the functional maturation of the spermatozoa. • It occurs in the fallopian tube and involves epithelial interactions between the sperm and the \nmucosal surface of the tube. • The glycoprotein coat and seminal plasma proteins are removed. • Only capacitated sperms can pass through the corona cells and undergo the acrosomal reaction. 2) Acrosomal reaction • It occurs after binding to zona pellucida, induced by zona proteins. • Enzymes such as acrosin and trypsin-like protein are released to penetrate the zona pellucida • Ca2+ plays an important role. 39 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Meiosis I or reductional division occurs in the transition from primary spermatocyte to secondary \nspermatocyte. Meiosis takes place in germ cells to generate male and female gametes. Meiosis involves two \nstages of cell division, namely, meiosis I and II. 40 \nSold by @itachibot Meiosis I produces two haploid cells. Because the ploidy is reduced from diploid to haploid, \nmeiosis I is referred to as a reductional division. Meiosis II is an equational division analogous to \nmitosis, resulting in the creation of four haploid daughter cells.",

      "explanation": "The secondary oocyte is formed after meiosis I. Primordial germ cells divide by mitosis to form oogonia. The majority of the oogonia divide by \nmitosis, however, some enter meiosis I and are arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase and are \nnow called primary oocytes. Primary oocytes have not yet completed meiosis, hence they are \ndiploid. The primary oocyte along with surrounding epithelial cells forms the primordial follicle. Meiosis I is completed after LH surge during puberty. Hence at the completetion of meiosis I, \nsecondary oocyte is produced. 41 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Zona hatching occurs at around 5 days after fertilization. Fertilization is divided into the following phases: • Penetration of the corona radiata • Penetration of the zona pellucida • Fusion of the oocyte and sperm cell membranes After fertilisation, the zygote differentiates to form the morula and then the blastocyst. The zona \npellucida disappears at this stage, which is called zona hatching. The trophoblasts (outer cell \nmass) are now able to associate with the endometrium during implantation.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the given image, the decidua basalis is marked as A. This part of the decidua forms the \nplacenta. Implantation occurs 6 to 7 days after fertilization. After implantation, the endometrium is called \nthe decidua. It is of the following types: • Decidua basalis - present over chorion frondosum. Decidua basalis and chorion frondosum form \nthe placenta. • Decidua capsularis - present over abembryonic pole. • Decidua parietalis - present on the opposite side of the uterus. The villi cover the entire surface of the chorion during the early weeks. As the fetus grows, the villi \non the embryonic pole continue to grow, giving rise to the chorion frondosum. At \nthe abembryonic pole, the villi degenerate. By the third month, this side of the chorion becomes \nsmooth, and is called the chorion laeve. 43 \nSold by @itachibot As the fetus grows, the chorion laeve comes into contact with the decidua parietalis on the \nopposite side of the uterus, and fusion occurs. Thus, the uterine lumen is obliterated. The amnion \nand chorion fuse, to form the amniochorionic membrane. Rupture of the amniochorionic \nmembrane during labor is called 'breaking of waters'. Note: Superfetation can theoretically occur till the time the uterine lumen is not obliterated.",
