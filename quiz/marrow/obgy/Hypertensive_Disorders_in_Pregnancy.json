Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as BP of &gt;140/90 mmHg measured 2 times with at least a \n4-hour interval. Proteinuria is not an essential criterion to define pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is hypertension with any of the following features: • Proteinuria • Thrombocytopenia 476 \nSold by @itachibot • Renal insufficiency • Liver involvement • Cerebral symptoms • Pulmonary edema. Note: A normotensive pregnant woman may have an acute increase in BP from baseline levels and \ndevelop eclamptic seizures/HELLP syndrome, despite being normotensive.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In a normal pregnancy, the remodeling of spiral arteries begins at 12 weeks. Remodeling of arteries includes invasion of arteries by trophoblasts that convert them from \nlow-flow, high-resistance to high-flow, low-resistance vessels. These modified vessels are more \ncapable of meeting the demands of the developing fetus. ’teroplacental vessel development takes place in two stages: The first stage occurs before 12 weeks post-fertilization. During this stage, invasion of spiral \narteries up to myometrium occurs. 477 \nSold by @itachibot The second stage occurs between 12-16 weeks. It involves invasion of the endovascular \ntrophoblasts into the intra-myometrial segments of spiral arteries. Interstitial \ntrophoblasts surround the arteries. Incomplete trophoblastic invasion leads to pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) where the \nvessels remain in a state of high resistance leading to placental ischemia and release of \ninflammatory mediators and vasoactive substances leading to endothelial injury. As the second stage of invasion occurs by 18 weeks, PIH develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "Calcium supplementation above the RDA does not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. However, women who have a calcium-deficient state may benefit from calcium supplementation \nto reduce their risk of preeclampsia. Prophylactic measures for the prevention of pre-eclampsia include low-dose aspirin \nadministration (50–150 mg/day). It is started after the 1st trimester, continued throughout \npregnancy, and is to be stopped 7 days before labor. Magnesium administration may be beneficial as it lowers endothelin-1 concentrates.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In pre-eclampsia, there is an increase in the level of soluble endoglin. Excessive amounts of antiangiogenic factors, increased sensitivity to angiotensin, and lowered \nangiotensinase levels worsen hypoxia at the uteroplacental interface. Trophoblast of women who develop preeclampsia overproduces at least two antiangiogenic \npeptides that enter the maternal circulation. They increase months before clinical preeclampsia \ndevelops. • Soluble endoglin (sEng) is derived from the placenta and blocks endothelial nitric \noxide-dependent vasodilatation. It also inhibits various TGF isoforms from binding to \nendothelial receptors. • Soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is a variant of the Flt-1 receptor for placental growth \nfactor (PlGF) and for VEGF. Increased maternal sFlt-1 levels inactivate and decrease circulating \nfree PlGF and VEGF concentrations, leading to endothelial dysfunction.",

      "explanation": "Decreased GFR is seen in pre-eclampsia. During normal pregnancy, renal blood flow and GFR are increased. However, in pre-eclampsia, \nrenal blood flow and GFR decrease due to increased renal afferent arteriolar resistance. The \nhallmark renal lesion is glomerular endotheliosis. Diminished filtration causes serum creatinine \nlevels and plasma uric acid concentration levels to rise. The elevation is also due to enhanced \ntubular reabsorption. The most common system involved in pre-eclampsia is the renal system. Several studies have demonstrated that pre-eclampsia is associated with low urinary calcium. This \nis often used as a predictive test.",

This differs \nfrom DIC where PT and PTT are elevated while the plasma fibrinogen level is decreased.

It is used in the prevention of cerebral palsy in very \nlow birth weight neonates. • Reduction of motor endplate sensitivity to acetylcholine, and thus is used as an adjunct in the \nmanagement of acute severe asthma in children and adults • Blocking of neuronal calcium influx, and is thus used in the conservative management of \npre-term labor (tocolytic, option D) • Inducing cerebral vasodilatation, dilating the uterine arteries, increasing the production of \nendothelial prostacyclin, and inhibiting platelet activation.

The image shows \ncompression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus which can sometimes lead to supine \nhypotension. During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the great vessels against the hard spine, \nwhen the patient is in the supine position. Of the two vessels, the vena cava is compressed, but the \naorta, owing to its structure is relatively resistant. Normally, the vena cava compression results in opening up collateral circulation by means of \nparavertebral and azygous veins but in some cases, when the collateral circulation fails to open \nup, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed resulting in hypotension, \ntachycardia, and syncope and is called supine vena cava syndrome. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to the lateral position. 489 \nSold by @itachibot Diabetes in Pregnancy",
