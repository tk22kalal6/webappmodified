      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is used for the screening of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and \nTurner's syndrome. It is not a diagnostic test. It is a novel genetic test that uses cell-free circulating fetal DNA in the maternal serum for \nscreening of chromosomal anomalies. DNA from the fetus is found circulating in the maternal blood in two forms - either inside the \nintact fetal cells or as cell-free DNA from the breakdown of placental fetal cells. In NIPT, the \ncell-free chromosome fragments are measured and the quantitative differences from normal \nfetuses are noted. NIPT can be performed after 10 weeks of gestation and is recommended after the routine \nfirst-trimester ultrasound assessment in high-risk pregnancies or if either 1st or 2nd-trimester \nscreening becomes positive. Its disadvantage is that it is very expensive and it can be used for \nscreening of only a few chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21 and it doesn't \nanalyse the entire karyotype.",

Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test for amniotic fluid AFP measurement. It was once considered \nthe standard for the diagnosis of open neural tube disorders but has been replaced in most centers \nby targeted sonography. Defects in fetal integuments, such as ventral wall and neural tube defects, permit fetal AFP to leak \ninto the amnionic fluid. This results in increased MSAFP levels. This is detected on screening \nperformed from 15 to 20 weeks of gestation. 153 \nSold by @itachibot Conditions with elevated MSAFP: • Wrong gestational age • Neural tube defects • Multiple pregnancies • Renal anomalies Conditions with decreased MSAFP: • Trisomies (Down's syndrome) • Gestational trophoblastic disease.",

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the major serum protein in the embryo and fetus. It is produced by the \nyolk sac and fetal liver. Option B: Diabetic patients have low levels of AFP. Option C: Gestational age influences the MSAFP levels. The maternal serum concentration \nincreases by approximately 15% per week during the second trimester. Option D: At about 13 weeks of gestation, the AFP concentration in the fetal serum and amniotic \nfluid are highest, after which it declines.
