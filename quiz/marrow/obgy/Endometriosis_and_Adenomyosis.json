By definition, endometriosis is the occurrence of benign endometrial tissue (glands and \nstroma) outside the cavity of the uterus. Endometriosis can occur anywhere in the body (except \nspleen) including the abdominal wall, lung, pleura, brain, etc. It is a proliferative, hormone-dependent disease of the childbearing period. Women between the \nage groups of 30-40 years are most commonly affected. Risk factors for endometriosis are as \nfollows: • Family history (7-10x risk with a 1st-degree relative) • Nulliparity 646 \nSold by @itachibot • In utero exposure to Diethylstilbestrol (DES) • Estrogen dependent conditions/Estrogen therapy • Immunological factor - Impaired T cell and NK cell activity and altered immunology in a woman \nmay increase the susceptibility to proliferation and growth.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history and the image showing characteristic powder burn spots seen over the \npelvic peritoneum on laparoscopy point toward a diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. On laparoscopy, the typical endometriotic lesions appear like small black, dark brown or bluish \ndots. These are called powder burns or gunshot appearance of the serosal surfaces of the \nperitoneum. They are nodules or small cysts containing old haemorrhages surrounded by a \nvariable degree of fibrosis. Subtle appearances of endometriosis seen on laparoscopy are: • Red flame-shaped areas • Red polypoid areas • Yellow-brown patches • White peritoneal plaques or scarring • Peritoneal defects - known as Allen Masters Syndrome • Subovarian adhesions. The lesions mentioned above are thought to be more active than the powder burn areas. Endometriotic lesions in the peritoneal cavity contain yellowish-brown fluid. This fluid contains \nprostaglandins that are responsible for the pain associated with this condition. Endometriosis of \nthe ovary leads to formation of the chocolate cyst which is a true cyst with columnar epithelium \nlining. The image below shows the laparoscopic appearance of endometriotic lesions in the pouch of \nDouglas and on the right, the sacrouterine ligament.

Endometriosis is defined by the presence of “ectopic” endometrial tissue at a site outside of the \nuterus. Endometriosis is a proliferative hormone-dependent disease of the childbearing period. It \nis extremely rare before menarche and disappears after menopause. The endometriotic implants show certain differences when compared to normal endometrium. \nThere is increased production of estrogen by endometriotic stromal cells due to high levels of the \nenzyme aromatase.
