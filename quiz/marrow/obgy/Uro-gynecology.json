      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the best time to perform fistula repair is 6 weeks after the inciting surgery. In uncomplicated fistulas, early surgical intervention is preferred within the first 24 to 48 hours \nfollowing the inciting surgery. This avoids the brisk postoperative inflammatory response. However, if extensive and severe inflammation is present, repair of fistula can be delayed to 6 \nweeks after the surgery. This is usually done in a patient who has undergone major surgery, During this delay it is ensured that all the tissue inflammation has subsided, tissue vascularisation \nhas improved and local infection has cleared. Estrogen therapy should be instituted in \npostmenopausal women in this time period. In case the fistula repair fails, a second attempt is made only after 3 months.",

Youssef syndrome is seen in \ncases of vesicouterine fistulas, and it is associated with a classic triad: • Amenorrhea • Cyclical hematuria - also called menouria: Menstrual blood trickles into the bladder through the \nfistula, causing hematuria • Urinary continence (there is no vaginal leakage of urine) Hysteroscopy and cystoscopy are gold-standard investigations.

      "explanation": "Latzko procedure is not beneficial for a patient with genuine stress incontinence as it is done for \nvesicovaginal fistula. The various surgeries done for genuine stress incontinence (GSI) are as follows: • Vaginal approach • Kelly repair • Pacey repair • Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz operation - abdominal approach. It is not done anymore as it causes \nosteitis of the pubis. • Burch colposuspension • Combined vaginal and abdominal suspension - Pereyra operation • Slings • Tension-free vaginal taping • Transobturator taping • Laparoscopic suspension of the bladder neck • Periurethral collagen injection",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of urge incontinence. It occurs due to detrusor instability. During normal micturition, the detrusor muscle contracts after being stimulated by the \nparasympathetic nerves. In detrusor instability, detrusor muscle contracts spontaneously or on \nprovocation during filling of the bladder. It is often caused by overactivity of parasympathetic \nnerves. It is usually seen in older women and is caused by: • Decreased bladder capacity - due to fibrosis • Decreased sensation • Central nervous system (CNS) inhibition - due to stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord \ninvolvement etc. It is associated with the following symptoms: • Incontinence • Urge to urinate • Increased frequency • Nocturia • Urination during sexual intercourse and with the sound of water, hand-washing. 588 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "In patient 3, detrusor instability is not seen, as this is a case of functional incontinence. During normal micturition, the detrusor muscle contracts after being stimulated by the \nparasympathetic nerves. In detrusor instability, detrusor muscle contracts spontaneously or on \nprovocation during filling of the bladder. It is often caused by the overactivity of parasympathetic \nnerves.

Treatment is initially conservative and include decreasing caffeine intake, smoking cessation, fluid \nrestriction and weight reduction. Anticholinergic drugs and bladder training may also be tried. Note: Functional incontinence occurs in patients with disabilities, whose bladder movements are \nnormal. However, due to environmental or physical barriers, involuntary leakage of urine occurs.",
