      "explanation": "Theca lutein cysts are rare in partial molar pregnancy, but may be seen in 25-30% of patients with \ncomplete molar pregnancy. Serum -hCG levels are elevated more than expected for gestational age in a complete mole. The sensitivity of most hCG tests is set to the pregnancy hCG range. An excessive -hCG hormone \ncauses an oversaturation of the test assay giving a false negative UPT. This is called the hook \neffect. The thyrotropin-like effects of hCG frequently cause serum free-T4 levels to be elevated which \nnormalize after uterine evacuation.",

Laparoscopic oophorectomy is done only when there is associated extensive necrosis or \nhemorrhage.

During the \nfollow-up period, pregnancy must be avoided as it might interfere with the  hCG levels. The initial -hCG level is obtained within 48 hours after evacuation and used as a baseline.

As \nsyncytiotrophoblastic cells are generally absent in this site, it is composed mainly \nof cytotrophoblastic cells. Patients with placental site trophoblastic tumors present with vaginal bleeding and modestly \nelevated serum -hCG levels. Local invasion into the myometrium and lymphatics occurs. \nHysterectomy is the preferred treatment.",

Her \nserum beta hCG levels were persistently low and USG revealed a single solid mass in the \nuterine fundus. Histopathological examination of the biopsy showed abundant intermediate \ntrophoblastic cells. What is the next step of management?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of placental-site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). \nHysterectomy is the treatment of choice because they are locally invasive tumors and resistant to \nchemotherapy. PSTT is a rare tumor arising from intermediate trophoblastic of the placental bed. Patients with \nplacental site trophoblastic tumors present with vaginal bleeding and modestly elevated serum \n-hCG levels. They produce variant forms of hCG. 453 \nSold by @itachibot Anemia in Pregnancy",
