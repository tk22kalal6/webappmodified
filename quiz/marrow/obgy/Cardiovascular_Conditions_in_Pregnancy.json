      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The best technique for managing the second stage of labor in a patient with heart disease is using \nventouse. For most cardiac patients, vaginal delivery is preferred and cesarean section is reserved for \nobstetric indications since the cesarean section is associated with more blood loss and higher \nthromboembolic and infection risk. If vaginal delivery is selected as the mode of choice, it will be \nconducted with the laboring woman in an upright position, or in the left decubitus position. This \nminimizes aortocaval compression. Active pushing during the second stage may also be limited, depending on the degree of cardiac \ncompromise. In moderate to severe cardiac disease, it may be prudent to completely avoid an \nactive second stage. Regional anesthesia can be used to allow the fetal head to descend to the \nperineum without active pushing. Delivery can be further facilitated by forceps or vacuum \nextraction. The benefit of avoiding hemodynamic fluctuations resulting from pushing must be weighed \nagainst an increased risk of perineal trauma, hemorrhage, and fetal head injury with forceps or \nvacuum delivery. Some journals report that ventouse is preferable to forceps, as it can be applied without putting \nthe patient in lithotomy position (raising the legs increases the cardiac load) however it is \ncontroversial.",

They do not induce an anticoagulant effect in the infant. The choice of anticoagulants is the main problem in pregnancy due to the following reasons: • Warfarin: Although safe for the mother, can lead to warfarin embryopathy, miscarriage, IUGR, \nand stillbirths. • Heparin: It is safe for the fetus as it does not cross the placenta but less effective than warfarin. • LMWH: Inadequate and ACOG does not recommend its use in pregnant women with prosthetic \nheart valves.

      "explanation": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a feature of peripartum cardiomyopathy (also known as \npostpartum cardiomyopathy) and not diastolic dysfunction. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. It develops during \nthe last month of pregnancy or within the first 5 months following delivery. The predisposing factors include Cardiac gene mutations involving several genes like TTNC1, \nTTN, and STAT3, Twin pregnancy/ multifetal gestation, Smoking, and Preeclampsia. Other \nproposed causes include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, \nmalnutrition, inflammation, etc. PPCM is associated with increased secretion of prolactin by the pituitary and antiangiogenic \nmolecule sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase) by the placenta at term gestation. Pearson’s diagnostic criteria for PPCM: • Development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery • Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure • Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy, and • Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by echocardiographic criteria, such as \nejection fraction &lt;45% or fractional shortening &lt;30% along with a dilated left ventricle.

      "options": {
        "a": "Coarctation of aorta",
        "b": "Mitral stenosis",
        "c": "Eisenmenger syndrome",
        "d": "Aortic stenosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Eisenmenger syndrome is the heart disease with the worst prognosis, having a maternal mortality \nrate of 50%. The most common cause of death in Eisenmenger’s syndrome is right ventricular failure with \ncardiogenic shock. If antenatal diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome is made in the first trimester, \ntermination of pregnancy is advised. Eisenmenger syndrome has the highest risk of maternal \nmortality. However, since mitral stenosis is the most common cardiac condition in pregnancy, it is \nthe most common cause of maternal mortality overall. Mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse and pulmonary stenosis are well tolerated during \npregnancy. Severe aortic stenosis can be life-threatening. However, women with mild to moderate \naortic valve stenosis may have a relatively low-risk pregnancy.",

After the delivery of the placenta, she \nstarted to bleed profusely. Which among the following should not be used to control \nbleeding?",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario indicates postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in a primigravida with rheumatic \nmitral stenosis. Methyl ergometrine is contraindicated in patients with organic heart disease. Contraindications of methyl ergometrine are: • Twin pregnancy - Second baby gets compromised by tetanic contractions of uterus if given after \ndelivery of first baby • Organic cardiac disease - Causes overloading of right heart by squeezing blood from uterine \ncirculation. • Severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia • Rh negative mother - Increases chance of fetomaternal transfusion. 519 \nSold by @itachibot Rhesus Isoimmunization",
