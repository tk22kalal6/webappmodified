      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Endometrial tuberculosis is most commonly acquired by direct spread from the fallopian \ntubes. Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacilli implant \ninto the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by direct \nextension. Female genital tuberculosis is an important cause of significant morbidity, short and long-term \nsequelae especially infertility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary \n(commonest) or extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and miliary TB. However, \nprimary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male partners have active genitourinary TB 754 \nSold by @itachibot (e.g., tuberculosis epididymitis) by transmission through infected semen Most common site involved in secondary genital TB is fallopian tube (90-100%) &gt;endometrium \n(50-80%) &gt;ovaries (20-30%) &gt;cervix 5-15%) &gt;vulva. The most common symptom of \ngenital TB is infertility. Causes of infertility in genital TB: • Tubal blockage • If tubes are patent, then also infertility occurs due to loss of tubal function. • Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium. • Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volume A laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnose \ngenital TB, especially for tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined with \nhysteroscopy. Multiple drug therapy ( ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficient \nduration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.",

        "d": "It commonly presents as a unilateral condition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Genital tuberculosis is a bilateral condition. It can be caused by both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (95% cases) and Mycobacterium bovis (5% \ncases). It almost always occurs secondary to a primary focus elsewhere in the body. The most \ncommon primary focus is lungs &gt; lymph nodes &gt; abdomen &gt; generalised miliary \ninfection. It mostly spreads hematogenously. Lymphatic spread is also seen sometimes. It can rarely spread \nby direct contact with the affected intraabdominal organs or peritoneum. The fallopian tubes are the first to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital \norgans and the peritoneum. This is followed by the involvement of bilateral pelvic lymph nodes. \nVulvovaginal involvement is usually secondary to uterine involvement. The most common presentation of genital tuberculosis in the reproductive age group is infertility.",

Genital tuberculosis mostly presents in young women in the reproductive age group. It can \npresent as: • Infertility is the only complaint in 35-60 % of cases. Of these, 75% of women present with \nprimary infertility. • Menstrual abnormalities are seen in 10-40% of cases. • Asymptomatic in 10% of cases. 755 \nSold by @itachibot • Other symptoms like fever and malaise can be seen. The treatment of infertility in women with genital TB depends on the condition of the \nendometrium. If the endometrium is receptive and the uterus is normal, then assisted \nreproductive techniques such as in-vitro fertilisation can be tried. If the endometrium is \nunfavourable then surrogacy may be considered.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The fimbriae are often spared even in advanced forms of tubercular salpingitis. The involvement of fallopian tubes is 100% and bilateral, secondary to hematogenous spread. The \nampullary part of the tube appears dilated with the fimbrial end open and pouting. This gives the \ncharacteristic tobacco-pouch appearance as seen in the image below. The external surface of the tubes are enlarged, roughened, and may show the presence of greyish \ntubercles. The cut section shows yellowish-grey caseous matter in the lumen. Sometimes, \nserosanguinous fluid can also be seen in the lumen of the fallopian tube. This is called tuberculous \nhematosalpinx. On histopathological examination of the tubes, granulomas and chronic inflammatory infiltrate \nwith hyperplasia is seen. This could be mistaken for malignancy as it also produces a similar \nhistological image.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with abdominal pain, amenorrhoea, pelvic mass and ascites is \nsuggestive of genital tuberculosis. Genital tuberculosis: 756 \nSold by @itachibot It is caused by M. tuberculosis and almost always occurs secondary to primary infection elsewhere \nin the extragenital states. The sites and frequency of involvement are as follows: • Fallopian tubes (90-100%) • Endometrium (50-60%) • Ovaries (20-30%) • Cervix (5-15%) • Vulva and vagina (&lt; 1%) Presentation is variable and it can be asymptomatic in 10-20% of cases, infertility, menstrual \nirregularities, abdominal pain and mass, vaginal discharge, fistula formation, ectopic pregnancy \nand ascites. The mass is made up of rolled-up omentum that is adherent to the uterus and adnexa. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weakness, anorexia or night sweats may be present. Investigations: • CBC, ESR and Mantoux test • Hysterosalpingography shows a lead-pipe appearance of the fallopian tube, calcification of the \ntube, beading and variation in the filling, cornual block, jagged fluffiness of tubal outline and \ntobacco pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx. • Laparoscopy establishes the diagnosis of genital TB. It shows tuberculous lesions and \nperihepatic adhesions (if present). Differential diagnosis: • Ovarian cyst, broad ligament cyst or encysted fluid • Pelvic inflammatory disease • Ectopic pregnancy • Carcinoma cervix • Elephantiasis of the vulva • Pregnancy • Puberty menorrhagia and postmenopausal bleeding • Fungal infection and sarcoidosis Management: It is treated with anti-tubercular therapy for 6 months (DOT strategy): Indications and contraindications for surgery: Types of surgery include vulvectomy (if vulval hypertrophy is present), removal of the adnexal \nmass, drainage of pyometra and fistula repair. TAH+BSO is rarely required nowadays. Tuboplasty is contraindicated. Option B: Ovarian tumors usually don't affect menstrual cycles. Though virilizing tumors can \ncause amenorrhoea, other features of virilization such as hirsutism, flattening of breasts, and \nenlargement of the clitoris are generally present. 757 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Though ectopic pregnancy may be suspected here, the tube is likely to rupture with \nexacerbation of pain, bleeding, and peritonitis before six months of gestation. Additionally, the \nabsence of vaginal bleeding/spotting, and the presence of weight loss makes the diagnosis \nunlikely. Option D: Submucous fibroid is associated with menorrhagia.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The Quantiferon test will be positive in patients having genital TB. It is an indicator of latent \ntuberculosis. The Quantiferon test measures the release of interferon-gamma by T cells following \nstimulation by antigens unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A differential WBC count shows lymphocytosis at all stages of genital tuberculosis. The ESR is \nfrequently raised and is a non-specific investigation at any stage of the disease. None of these tests \ncan be used for confirmation as these markers are raised in many infections. The Mantoux test is positive in 90% of cases of genital TB. It is indicative of past exposure to the \ntubercle bacilli. It is not a confirmatory investigation but a negative result indicates tuberculosis \nto be unlikely.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A wedge-shaped defect is not suggestive of tubercular salpingitis. It is seen at the uterine isthmus \nin patients with a history of Cesarean section with a uterine scar. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) features of genital tuberculosis are: • Lead pipe appearance due to rigid nonperistaltic pipe-like tube 758 \nSold by @itachibot • Beading and variation in filling defect • Calcification of the tube • Jagged fluffiness of the tubal outline • Tobacco-pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx • Golf club appearance with slight or moderate dilatation of the ampullary portion of the fallopian \ntube. • Rosette type appearance secondary to multiple small diverticular like outpouching surrounding \nthe ampulla produced by caseous ulceration. HSG is contraindicated in genital tuberculosis as it causes dissemination of the infection. This \nfurther increases the damage to the fallopian tubes. The investigation of choice in genital tuberculosis is an endometrial biopsy. The tubercle bacilli \nare present in the deeper layers of the endometrium. They come to the surface just before \nmenstruation. Hence, an endometrial biopsy is done 1 or 2 days before menstruation. Menstrual blood can also be used for detecting mycobacteria. An HSG showing the features of tuberculous salpingitis is given below.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows bilateral hydrosalpinx. It appears as a thin-walled structure. A hydrosalpinx is a chronic cystic swelling of the fallopian tube that forms after a distal tubal \nobstruction. The tubes are enormously distended due to filling with clear serous fluid and \nbecome retort-shaped. On histology, the tubal plicae appear flattened. The interstitial end of the \ntube is open whereas the fimbrial end is indrawn and closed. This permits the dye to enter but not \nexit the tube during HSG. It is caused due to: 759 \nSold by @itachibot • Pelvic inflammatory disease • Endometriosis • Tuberculosis - tubercular salpingitis may also cause tobacco-pouch appearance, lead pipe \nappearance and pyosalpinx • Fallopian tube neoplasms (rare) It can be an incidental finding during a pelvic exam or ultrasound. The patient may \nbe asymptomatic, or present with infertility or chronic pelvic pain. On HSG, it appears as terminal sacculation and occlusion of both fallopian tubes with a normal \nuterine cavity. Usually, a thin-walled, hypoechoic, cystic structure is seen. However, it may appear \nas multiple hyperechoic mural nodules around the inner circumference of the tube creating a \n'beads on a string' appearance.
