      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "An elective caesarean section should ideally be performed after 39 weeks. It is not done before 39 weeks of gestation as there is an increased risk of: • Complications related to prematurity including respiratory problems • Neonatal adaptation problems such as hypothermia and hypoglycemia",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "According to ACOG guidelines, the ideal time to administer antibiotics is within a time period of \n60 mins prior to the planned caesarean section. Antimicrobial administration before surgical incision has been shown to lower postoperative \ninfection rates without adverse neonatal effects, as compared with drug administration after \numbilical cord clamping. A 1 g dose of cefazolin is an efficacious and cost-effective choice. For emergency delivery, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above partogram is suggestive of obstructed labour and the definitive management in this \ncase is caesarean section. Cefazolin is an efficacious and cost-effective choice for antibiotic \nprophylaxis before caesarean section. According to the partogram, there is a secondary arrest of dilatation for &gt;2 hours and arrest of \ndescent for &gt;1 hour. The amniotic fluid is stained with meconium and there is fall in fetal heart \nrate indicating fetal distress. Hence, the management plan is to perform a caesarean section. The recommended prophylactic drug is a single intravenous dose of a -lactam antimicrobial. This \ncould either be a cephalosporin or an extended-spectrum penicillin derivative. A 1 g dose of \ncefazolin is usually given. For obese women, a 2 g dose is better to provide an adequate coverage.",

      "explanation": "Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis before surgical procedures is recommended \nin patients with prosthetic valves, prior history of endocarditis, and unrepaired cyanotic heart \ndiseases. Pregnant women at the highest risk for endocarditis are those with cyanotic cardiac disease, \nprosthetic valves, or both. However, endocarditis prophylaxis is not required if the patient is \nalready receiving intrapartum prophylaxis with broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent \nendometritis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for atrial septal defect (ASD). The risk of endocarditis \nwith ASD is negligible. Bacterial endocarditis is associated with unrepaired ventricular septal 279 \nSold by @itachibot defects where antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Similarly, prophylaxis for bacterial \nendocarditis is indicated at delivery for unrepaired patent ductus arteriosus.",

General anaesthesia may be indicated for emergency cesarean delivery in patients with a \nreassuring airway examination. It is also recommended for patients with severe coagulopathy \nwhere neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated. Spinal anesthesia is not preferred when the operation is expected to result in blood loss or in a \npreviously haemorrhaging patient. It is because in such cases the development of severe \nhypovolemia is likely which is a contraindication for this type of anaesthesia.",

      "explanation": "The recti muscles are transected in the Maylard incision for caesarean delivery which is marked as \n'2' in the given image. It is a variation of the Pfannenstiel incision in which the rectus abdominis muscles are sectioned \ntransversely to permit wider access to the pelvis. It is also known as the Mackenrodt incision. The various incisions mentioned in the image are: Incision '1' - Midline vertical incision is made in the middle extending from just below the \numbilicus to just above the symphysis pubis. This is used less commonly compared to the \ntransverse abdominal incision. Incision '3' - Joel Cohen is a straight incision higher than the Pfannenstiel incision. The fascia was \nincised transversely in the midline then extended laterally with blunt finger dissection; finger \ndissection was used to separate the rectus muscles vertically and laterally. Incision '4' - Pfannenstiel incision is the most common incision made in caesarean delivery. It \nfollows Langer lines of skin tension. A transverse and slightly curvilinear incision is made in the \nskin and subcutaneous tissue 3 cm above the superior border of the pubic symphysis. 280 \nSold by @itachibot This is stretched laterally for 12-15 cm to accommodate the delivery of the fetus. Following this, \nthe rectus sheath is incised transversely and rectus muscles are separated in the middle to gain \nentry to the peritoneum.",

      "explanation": "In a C-section, the incision on the uterus can be extended by using lateral and slightly upward \npressure applied with each index finger. If the lower uterine segment is thick, then cutting laterally and then slightly upward with bandage \nscissors will extend the incision. Note: When scissors are used, the index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand should be \ninsinuated between the myometrium and the fetal parts to prevent fetal laceration.",

Benefits of exteriorization: • Relaxed, atonic uterus can be recognized quickly and massage applied. • The incision and bleeding points are more easily visualized and repaired. • Adnexal exposure is superior, and thus, tubal sterilization is easier.
