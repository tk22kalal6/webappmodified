      "explanation": "In Tay–Sachs disease, an electron microscope shows whorled configurations within lysosomes \ncomposed of onion-skin layers of membranes. Affected infants appear normal at birth but begin to manifest signs and symptoms at about 6 \nmonths of age. The involvement of neurons in the central and autonomic nervous systems and \nretina dominates the clinical picture. There is a severe motor and mental deterioration, beginning with motor incoordination and \nmental obtundation. This leads to muscular flaccidity, blindness, and increasing dementia. Over \nthe span of 1 or 2 years, a completely vegetative state is reached, followed by death at age 2 to 3 \nyears On histologic examination, the neurons are ballooned with cytoplasmic vacuoles, each \nrepresenting a markedly distended lysosome filled with gangliosides. A cherry-red spot appears in the macula, representing the accentuation of the normal color of the \nmacular choroid. This is in contrast with the pallor produced by the swollen ganglion cells in the \nremainder of the retina. This finding is characteristic of Tay-Sachs disease and other storage \ndisorders affecting the neurons. The image given below shows a cherry-red spot on retina. 171 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Niemann–Pick disease types A and B are two related disorders that are characterized by lysosomal \naccumulation of sphingomyelin due to an inherited deficiency of sphingomyelinase. The disease is typically inherited as an autosomal recessive condition on chromosome 11.
