      "explanation": "Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is the most common type of ASD. 746 \nSold by @itachibot ASDs are abnormal, fixed openings in the atrial septum caused by incomplete tissue formation \nthat allows communication of blood between the left and right atria. It results in a left-to-right shunt. Excess blood flow through the ASD and/or the pulmonary valve \nresults in a murmur. They are generally well-tolerated and usually do not become symptomatic \nbefore the age of 30 years. ASDs are classified according to their location: • Secundum ASD (90%) - usually isolated defects, can be of any size, multiple or fenestrated • Primum anomalies (5%) - occur adjacent to the AV valves, often associated with AV valve defects \nand/or VSD • Sinus venosus defects (5%) - located near SVC entrance and can be associated with anomalous \npulmonary venous return to the right atrium",

In rheumatic mitral stenosis, calcification and fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures \ncreate fish mouth or buttonhole stenosis. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is associated with loud S1. The most common causes of various valvular diseases are: • Aortic stenosis (AS) - calcification due to normal aging or congenitally bicuspid aortic valves • Aortic regurgitation (AR) - dilatation of the ascending aorta, often secondary to hypertension \nand/or aging • Mitral regurgitation (MR) - myxomatous degeneration (mitral valve prolapse)",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and echo findings are suggestive of calcific aortic stenosis secondary \nto bicuspid aortic valve (2 functional cusps). It is due to incomplete separation of valve \ncommissures during development, not abnormal fusion. 749 \nSold by @itachibot In a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve, the 2 functional cusps are usually of unequal size. The \nlarger cusp has a midline raphe that results from incomplete commissural separation during \ndevelopment. The raphe is frequently a major site of calcific deposits. This condition is associated with mutations in the following areas: • Chromosomes 18q, 5q, and 13q • Chromosome 9q - loss-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 gene Late complications include: • Aortic stenosis or regurgitation • Infective endocarditis • Aortic dilation and/or dissection. • Predisposed to progressive calcification - Approximately 50% of cases of aortic stenosis in \nadults. Note: Acquired bicuspid valves result from abnormal fusion of valve commissures because of an \nacquired deformity (rheumatic valve disease). It produces a conjoined cusp that is generally twice \nthe size of the nonconjoined cusp.",

      "explanation": "The clinical features and echocardiography findings are suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) \nor Barlow syndrome. It is not associated with degenerative calcified deposits (seen in calcific \nvalvular degeneration, not MVP). Barlow syndrome is more common in females. It may be an isolated condition or less commonly \ncan be associated with connective tissue disorders like Marfan's syndrome. In this condition, there is mitral annular dilatation with floppy mitral valve leaflets. They prolapse \nor balloon back into the left atrium during systole. The following pathological changes are seen: • Interchordal ballooning (hooding) of the mitral leaflets • Thick, rubbery, redundant leaflets • Thickened mural endocardium The main histologic change is marked thickening of the spongiosa layer with deposition of mucoid \ncalled myxomatous degeneration. Most individuals diagnosed with MVP are asymptomatic. On auscultation, a mid-systolic click, \nsometimes followed by a mid to late systolic murmur is heard. Chest pain mimicking angina and \ndyspnea occur rarely.

Carcinoid heart disease refers to the cardiac manifestations caused by the bioactive compounds \nreleased by carcinoid tumors. Classically, the endocardium and valves of the right heart are \nprimarily affected. Findings in carcinoid heart syndrome: • Endocardial plaque-like thickening and fibrosis • Tricuspid insufficiency • Pulmonary stenosis • No valve destruction • Myocardium not involved The left side of the heart is less commonly affected because the pulmonary vascular bed degrades \nthe mediators.
