      "explanation": "Serotonin and histamine are among the first mediators to be released during inflammation. \nThey are stored as preformed molecules in cells. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a preformed vasoactive mediator that is present in platelets \nand certain neuroendocrine cells, such as in the gastrointestinal tract. Its functions include \nvasoconstriction and neurotransmitter action in the gastrointestinal tract.",

      "explanation": "The sources of histamine include platelets, basophils, and mast cells (major source). Preformed histamine is stored in the granules of mast cells and other cells. It is released by \ndegranulation in response to a variety of stimuli, including: • Physical injuries - trauma, cold, or heat • Binding of antibodies to mast cells • Products of complement called anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) Its vasoactive effects are mediated mainly via binding to H1 receptors on microvascular \nendothelial cells. The functions of histamine include: • Vasodilation • Increased vascular permeability • Endothelial activation",

      "explanation": "The given histopathological findings in a patient with tuberculosis are suggestive \nof granulomatous inflammation, with epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells. These cells are \nderived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage. 106 \nSold by @itachibot Macrophages activated by IFN- develop into cells with abundant cytoplasm. They resemble \nepithelial cells and are thus called epithelioid cells. Some activated macrophages may fuse, \nforming multinucleated giant cells. Collections of activated macrophages, often with T \nlymphocytes are seen in granulomatous inflammation. Sometimes it is associated with central \ncaseating necrosis. Granulomas may be formed in response to various stimuli: • Immune granulomas - due to T-cell mediated response; macrophages activate T cells to produce \ncytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN- • Foreign body granulomas - due to inert foreign bodies in the absence of a T-cell mediated \nresponse",
