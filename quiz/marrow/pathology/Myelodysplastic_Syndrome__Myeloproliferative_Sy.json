The bone marrow biopsy stained with Perl's Prussian blue shows ringed sideroblasts. They \nare erythroblasts with iron-laden mitochondria visible as perinuclear granules as shown in the \nimage below. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by maturation \ndefects, associated with ineffective hematopoiesis. It is of two types: • Primary MDS - develops slowly, usually after 50 years of age. • Secondary or therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) - develops 2 to 8 years after toxic drug or radiation \nexposure with poor prognosis Patients usually present with weakness, infections and hemorrhages due to pancytopenia. Both \ntypes of MDS have a high risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, most \nfrequent and rapid transformation occurs in therapy-related MDS (t-MDS).",

Blasts constitute &lt;20% of the cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. 598 \nSold by @itachibot • 3. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of chronic myeloid leukemia or other myeloproliferative \nneoplasms (MPN).b • 4. Not meeting diagnostic criteria of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions.c Supporting criteria: • 1. Dysplasia involving 1 myeloid lineage.d • 2. Acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality. • 3. Abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets.e Pre-requisite criteria must be present in all cases: • If monocytosis is  1 × 109/ L: one or more supporting criteria must be met. • If monocytosis is 0.5 and &lt;1 × 109/ L: supporting criteria 1 and 2 must be met. Subtype criteria: • Myelodysplastic CMML (MD-CMML): WBC &lt; 13 × 109/L • Myeloproliferative CMML (MP-CMML): WBC  13 × 109/L a. Blasts and blast equivalents include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and promonocytes. b. MPN with monocytosis can mimic CMML. In these instances, a documented history of MPN \nexcludes CMML. The presence of MPN features in the bone marrow and/or a high burden of \nMPN-associated mutations (JAK2, CALR, or MPL) tends to support MPN with monocytosis rather \nthan CMML. c. Criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions should be specifically \nexcluded in cases with eosinophilia. d. Morphologic dysplasia should be present in 10% of cells of a hematopoietic lineage in the bone \nmarrow. e. Based on the detection of increased classical monocytes (&gt;94%) in the absence of known \nactive autoimmune diseases and/or systemic inflammatory syndromes.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Polycythemia vera is strongly associated with activating point mutations in the tyrosine kinase \nJAK2. A mutation in JAK2, a key member of the cytokine intracellular signaling pathway, can be found \nin 90–95% of patients with polycythemia vera. It is characterized by : • Increased marrow production of red cells, granulocytes, and platelets (panmyelosis) • Low erythropoietin levels and elevated hematocrit • Blood viscosity and sludging lead to both thrombosis and bleeding. • Headache, dizziness, hypertension, dizziness, venous thrombosis (Budd Chiari syndrome due to \nhepatic vein thrombosis), bowel infarction, and stroke. • Intense pruritus especially aquagenic pruritus • Peptic ulceration, hyperuricemia • 15% to 20% of patients after an average period of 10 years -&gt;Myelofibrosis and extensive \nextramedullary hematopoiesis, • PCV transforms into AML in 2% of patients. Primary myelofibrosis • Marrow fibrosis associated with extramedullary hemopoiesis in the spleen. • Activating mutation in JAK2 (more commonly) or MPL. • Presence of neoplastic megakaryocytes, which are responsible for the release of fibrogenic \nfactors like PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF- . • Bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap due to fibrosis of the bone marrow. • So, bone marrow biopsy is the investigation of choice, which shows the presence of \nhypocellularity with increased deposition of reticulin inside the marrow, abnormal \nmegakaryocytes and the characteristic finding of dilated marrow sinusoids. • Blood shows mild leukocytosis, decreased Hb and hematocrit levels, and elevated LAP scores. • Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 5% to 20% of cases. 600 \nSold by @itachibot Essential thrombocytosis (ET) may also be associated with JAK2, MPL, or CALR mutations. • Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is often associated with activating point mutations in JAK2 (50% \nof cases) or MPL (5% to 10% of cases), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally activated by \nthrombopoietin. • In addition, recent DNA sequencing studies have revealed that most of the remaining cases have \nmutations in calreticulin (CALR), a protein with several functions in the endoplasmic reticulum \nand the cytoplasm. Since JAK2 and calreticulin mutations are mutually exclusive, it is \nhypothesized that the calreticulin mutations also increase JAK-STAT signaling through \nmechanisms that are currently unknown. CML is the consequence of the balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]). PV, PMF, and ET are characterized by driver mutations that directly or indirectly constitutively \nactivate JAK2, a tyrosine kinase essential for the function of the erythropoietin \nandthrombopoietin receptors and also utilized by granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor.",
