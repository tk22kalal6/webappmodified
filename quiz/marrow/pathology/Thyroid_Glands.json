      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Graves' disease is the most common cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disorder due to the production of TSH-receptor stimulating \nimmunoglobulins (TSI) which cause hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the triad of: • Thyrotoxicosis • Infiltrative ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos) • Dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) Glycosaminoglycan deposition, lymphoid infiltrates, and fatty infiltrates are responsible for \nophthalmopathy and dermopathy. Grossly, there is a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland and a beefy deep red parenchyma. \nHistology shows tall crowded follicular cells with scalloped margins and lymphoid infiltrates. \nLaboratory features include elevations in free T3 and T4 and decreased TSH.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and histological appearance showing amyloid stroma are suggestive of \nmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid. This condition can occur in the setting of MEN2A (Sipple \nsyndrome) or MEN2B. 1162 \nSold by @itachibot Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the \nparafollicular cells or C cells of the thyroid. They may be: • Sporadic (70%) • Familial or associated with MEN2 syndromes (30%) - • More aggressive and metastasize more frequently than sporadic • Usually bilateral and multicentric Both forms can be associated with RET mutations. These tumors may present with: • Mass in the neck • Dysphagia • Hoarseness • Diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP • Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH secretion Histopathology shows polygonal to spindle-shaped cells, which may form nests, trabeculae, and \neven follicles. Acellular amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in the \nstroma. These lesions secrete calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen. 1163 \nSold by @itachibot The Adrenals",
