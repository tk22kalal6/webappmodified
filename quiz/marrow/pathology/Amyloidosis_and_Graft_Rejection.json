      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Amyloid can be best described as a proteoglycan. Amyloidosis refers to the extracellular deposition of fibrillar proteins. Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. The fibrillar deposits \nbind a wide variety of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate and dermatan \nsulfate), and plasma proteins (serum amyloid P component). The abundant charged sugar groups in these adsorbed proteins give the deposits staining \ncharacteristics that resemble starch (amylose). Therefore, these deposits are called amyloid. Amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance.",

      "explanation": "There is the deposition of AA proteins in reactive systemic amyloidosis (secondary amyloidosis). In inflammatory states, there is a release of IL-1 and IL-6, which act on the liver cells. The liver \nincreases the production of SAA (serum amyloid-associated) proteins which circulate bound to \nhigh-density lipoproteins. This gives rise to AA proteins, which get deposited in tissues causing \nreactive systemic amyloidosis or secondary amyloidosis. The most common sites are the kidney and heart.

      "explanation": "Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is associated with the deposition of mutant \ntransthyretin protein (TTR). FAP is an autosomal dominant condition. The deposition occurs as amyloid fibrils in peripheral \nand autonomic nerves. Mutated TTR is prone to misfolding and aggregation, and shows resistance \nto proteolysis. Systemic senile amyloidosis (amyloid of aging) refers to the systemic deposition of normal \nTTR amyloid in elderly patients.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal-recessive condition seen in individuals of \nMediterranean descent (Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic). The affected gene encodes a \nprotein called pyrin, which is involved in cytokine production. The amyloid fibril proteins in this \ncondition are made up of AA proteins.
