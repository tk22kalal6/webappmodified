      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans and is made up of \n3.2 billion base pairs. It is encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosomes (haploid). In 2007, a multinational project called Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) concluded that \nabout 80% of the human genome does not code for the proteins. However, they allow for the \nbinding of proteins or are involved in the regulation of gene expression, in a cell type-specific \nfashion. They are known as functional non-protein-coding genes.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Epigenetics is the branch of molecular biology that deals with the study of heritable changes in \ngene function not involving changes in the DNA sequence. These heritable changes involve factors that mediate processes such as: • Histone organization • DNA methylation • Chromatin organization These in turn regulate the genomic organization and gene expression in a cell-type-specific \nfashion. The dysregulation of these epigenomic factors plays a major role in the development of \nmalignancy. Green tea catechins have been reported to modulate epigenetic processes. They can reverse DNA \nmethylation of tumor suppressor genes and increase the transcription of these genes. 13 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Micro-RNAs (miRNA) act during the post-transcriptional stage. It is a type of non-coding RNA. The primary function of miRNA is to modulate the translation of \ntarget mRNAs into their corresponding proteins. After the target RNA is transcribed from its gene \n(post-transcriptional), the miRNA may either induce mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. \nThis is referred to as gene silencing. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are short RNA sequences that can be introduced experimentally \ninto cells. They have functions similar to endogenous miRNA (serve as substrates for the Dicer \nenzyme and interact with the RNA-induced silencing complex). They may have a therapeutic role \nin silencing certain oncogenes.",

      "explanation": "Anaplasia refers to a lack of differentiation. The term anaplasia means to form backward implying a reversal of differentiation to a more \nprimitive level. The extent to which neoplastic cells resemble normal cells, both morphologically \nand functionally, is called differentiation. Anaplasia is an important morphological feature of malignant transformation. The morphological features of malignancy include: • Anaplasia • Pleomorphism - variation in the size and shape of cells • Increased N: C ratio (nucleus: cytoplasmic ratio) - around 1:4 in normal cells, increases to 1:1 in \nmalignant cells • Hyperchromasia - coarsely clumped and darkly stained chromatin within irregular nuclei • Increased mitosis - atypical, bizarre mitotic figures • Loss of polarity - sheets or large masses of tumor cells grow in an anarchic, disorganized fashion 23 \nSold by @itachibot Cell Death",
