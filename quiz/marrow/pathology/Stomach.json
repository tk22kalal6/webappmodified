Risk factors for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: • Turner syndrome • Trisomy 18 • Erythromycin or azithromycin exposure in the first 2 weeks of life either orally or via mother's \nmilk. Hyperplasia of the pyloric muscularis propria obstructs the gastric outflow tract. It is three to five times more common in males. Generally presents between 3rd and 6th weeks of \nlife as new-onset regurgitation, projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeding. Physical \nexamination reveals a firm, ovoid, 1 to 2 cm abdominal mass. In some cases, abnormal left to \nright hyperperistalsis is seen. Treatment is the surgical splitting of the muscularis (Ramstedt pyloromyotomy).",

Ileal carcinoid with metastasis to the liver cause carcinoid syndrome because the vasoactive \nsubstances escape the filtering actions of the liver. This is characterized by cutaneous flushing, \nsweating, bronchospasm, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac valvular \nfibrosis. The behavior of the carcinoid tumors differs according to their location: • Foregut carcinoid tumor • Stomach; duodenum, proximal to the ligament of Treitz; and esophagus • Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells • Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors • Variable behavior • Rarely metastasize and are generally cured by resection • Gastric carcinoid tumors without predisposing factors are often more aggressive • Midgut carcinoid tumor • Arise in the jejunum and ileum • Often multiple • Tend to be aggressive 1017 \nSold by @itachibot • Hindgut carcinoid • Arise in the appendix and colorectum • Appendiceal tumors are usually &lt; 2 cm in diameter and are almost always benign • Metastasis of rectal carcinoid tumors is uncommon Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic \natrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). It arises from \nthe interstitial cells of Cajal, or pacemaker cells, of the gastrointestinal muscularis propria. It is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen. The peak age of incidence is 60 \nyears. In sporadic GIST, the most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT \n(75-80%) and PDGFRA mutation (8%). Inherited/germline GIST is seen in Carney–Stratakis \nsyndrome. It is due to loss-of-function mutation of SDH which has increased risk for GIST and \nparaganglioma. GIST at a younger age is associated with the following: • Carney triad: • Gastric GIST • Paraganglioma • Pulmonary chondroma • Neurofibromatosis type 1 Grossly, it usually forms a solitary, well-circumscribed, fleshy mass covered by ulcerated or intact \nmucosa. Histologically, the tumor is composed of spindle cells (most common), epithelioid cells, or mixed \ncell types. 1018 \nSold by @itachibot The below image shows microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped \ntumor cells Complete surgical resection is the primary treatment for localized gastric GIST.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "1019 \nSold by @itachibot The eosinophilic appearing cells marked as A are the parietal cells, the absence of which is not \nassociated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. The cells marked as B are Chief cells. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, which leads to \nparital cell hyperplasia. Gastrinomas are almost always found in the small intestine or pancreas. \nThe most remarkable feature found in the stomach is an increase in oxyntic mucosal thickness \ndue to massive parietal cell hyperplasia. Other options: Option A and C: Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence \nof autoantibodies that impairs the production or activity of the intrinsic factor (IF) that is released \nfrom the parietal cells, which is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. There are three types of \nautoantibodies namely, type I, II, and III. The action of each of these include: • Autoantibody type I prevents the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor (IF). • Autoantibody type II prevents the binding of vitamin B12-IF complex to the ileal receptors. • Autoantibody type III acts against the  and  subunits of the gastric proton pump, which \nimpairs the production of intrinsic factor. These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells, \ninfiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells. Option B: Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. They \nare referred to as well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. The peak incidence of carcinoid \ntumors is in the 6th decade. These tumors occur throughout the GI tract, most commonly in the \nappendix, ileum, and rectum, in decreasing order of frequency. Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic \natrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Ileal carcinoid may cause carcinoid \nsyndrome which is characterized by cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm, colicky \nabdominal pain, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis. 1020 \nSold by @itachibot Small Intestine",
