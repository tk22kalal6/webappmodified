In this condition, the \nnormal basophilic cytoplasm of the corticotrophs of anterior pituitary becomes homogeneous and \npale. This is termed the Crooke hyaline change and is due to the accumulation of intermediate \nkeratin filaments in the cytoplasm. This change occurs due to high levels of circulating glucocorticoids in Cushing's syndrome. 1170 \nSold by @itachibot Based on the cause of Cushing's syndrome, the following pathological changes are seen in the \nadrenals: • Iatrogenic - atrophy of zona fasciculata and zona reticularis (as zona glomerulosa functions \nindependently of ACTH) • ACTH-dependent - diffuse hyperplasia (due to high ACTH levels) • ACTH-independent - nodular hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma Note: Eosinophilic inclusion bodies in adrenal cells are called spironolactone bodies.

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the image showing hyperpigmentation of palmar creases and oral \nmucosa are suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency. It presents with low aldosterone, high \nrenin, and high ACTH levels. In primary adrenal insufficiency, lack of aldosterone production results in compensatory rise in \nACTH and renin levels. The high ACTH results in hyperpigmentation. The most common causes \nare autoimmune in developed countries and tuberculosis in developing countries. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, there is pituitary dysfunction leading to low ACTH levels. \nRenin and aldosterone levels are normal, as they function independently of ACTH.",

It is caused by highly virulent organisms such as: • Neisseria meningitidis or meningococci (classically) • Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococci • Pseudomonas aeruginosa • Haemophilus influenzae • Staphylococcus species This condition is more common in children. Overwhelming bacterial infection leads to bilateral \nadrenal hemorrhage, thereby causing acute adrenal insufficiency.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The underlying pathology in patients with Conn's syndrome is adrenal adenoma. Hyperaldosteronism may be primary or secondary. Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to autonomous overproduction of aldosterone with resultant \nsuppression of RAAS. It can occur due to adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma. It presents \nwith the following features: • Hypertension (most common) • Hypokalemia • Metabolic alkalosis • Polyuria (due to ANP) • Polydipsia (due to polyuria) • Muscle weakness It is confirmed by elevated ratios of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity \n(PAC / PRA). When primary hyperaldosteronism is due to an aldosterone-secreting adenoma, it is called Conn \nsyndrome. Patients are usually treated with spironolactone followed by surgical removal of \nadenoma. In patients treated with spironolactone, the adenomas contain eosinophilic cytoplasmic \ninclusions called spironolactone bodies. 1173 \nSold by @itachibot In secondary hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone release occurs in response to the activation of the \nrenin-angiotensin system (RAAS).",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APS) type 1. It is also \ncalled APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy). It is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. This gene usually increases \ntolerance of central T-cells to peripheral tissue antigens. When this function is lost, the T-cells \nbecome more prone to mount immune reactions against tissue antigens, promoting \nautoimmunity. These patients develop autoantibodies against IL-17 and IL-22, which are crucial \nfor defense against fungal infections. It presents in childhood with the following features: • Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis • Ectodermal dystrophy (abnormalities of the skin, dental enamel, and nails) • Organ-specific autoimmune disorders such as - • Autoimmune adrenalitis • Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism • Idiopathic hypogonadism • Pernicious anemia Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) type 2 usually presents in early adulthood as a \ncombination of the following: • Adrenal insufficiency • Autoimmune thyroiditis or type 1 diabetes",
