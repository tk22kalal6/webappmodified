Reticulocytosis (increased reticulocytes) indicates effective erythropoiesis i.e. good bone marrow \nresponse to anaemia.

        "c": "3",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, the corrected reticulocyte count is 3. It is given by the following formula: Corrected reticulocyte count = Reticulocyte count × (patient's hemoglobin or hematocrit  standard \nhemoglobin or hematocrit) So, in this case, the corrected reticulocyte count = 9×5/15 = 9/3 = 3 This formula corrects for hemoglobin. It will show you if the patient is making enough \nreticulocytes for the degree of anemia present. As the hemoglobin drops, reticulocytes increase \nfrom the normal range of 0.5–2.0%. The standard reference range of hemoglobin concentration in females is 12-15 g/dl. Accordingly, in \nthis scenario, corrected reticulocyte count would range between 3-3.75%. So, the best answer to \nthis question remains option C. Absolute reticulocyte count is the percentage of red cells that are reticulocytes (normal is about \n0.5 – 2.0%). However, it does not reflect the fact that as the hemoglobin drops, there should be \nmore reticulocytes, percentage-wise (for example, at a hemoglobin of 5, you should have a much \nhigher percentage of reticulocytes than you should at a hemoglobin of 10). To take this into \naccount, we use corrected reticulocyte count. Reticulocyte Index = Corrected reticulocyte count / maturation factor This corrects for the longer life span of prematurely released reticulocytes in the blood which is a \nphenomenon of increased red blood cell production. 367 \nSold by @itachibot Hematocrit \nMaturation fact \nor  35% \n1.0 35% > Hct \n25% 1.5 25% > Hct \n20% 2.0 < 20% \n2.5",
