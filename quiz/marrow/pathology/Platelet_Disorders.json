      "explanation": "Rees and Ecker's solution is used as a diluting fluid in the RBC pipette for performing platelet \ncounts. Its composition is: The steps involved in platelet count are: I - Filling the pipette • Diluting fluid is drawn to mark 1 of the RBC pipette and expelled 419 \nSold by @itachibot • Blood is aspirated to 0.5 mark of the RBCs diluting pipette • Diluting fluid is aspirated to 101 mark • Blood and diluting fluid are mixed mechanically for 5 min II - Filling the counting chamber • Allow the counting chamber to stand for 20-30 minutes to allow the platelets to settle. • To prevent drying out of the preparation, it should be kept in a moist atmosphere, this is most \neasily arranged by placing the filled counting chamber in the bottom of a clean Petri dish, \nalongside which arrange a small piece of cotton wool which has been soaked in water and \nsqueezed out. Petri dish lid is additionally put over the dish. • After 20-30minutes, the counting chamber can be removed and carefully transferred to the \nmicroscope stage. III - Counting the number of platelets • Focus on the surface of the hemocytometer chamber with a high power dry objective. Dim the \nlight to make the thrombocytes visible, and count all of the thrombocytes in the entire center 1 \nmm² (erythrocyte counting area) of both sides of the hemocytometer.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is not synthesized by hepatocytes. They are produced by endothelial \ncells of liver and megakaryocytes. It is also found in: • Platelet granules - lesser compared to endothelial cells • Endothelial cells within cytoplasmic vesicles called Weibel-Palade bodies • Subendothelium - binds to collagen It mediates the adhesion of platelets to sites of vascular injury (subendothelium). It links the \nexposed collagen to platelets. It facilitates platelet to platelet interaction and also stabilizes the \nhemostatic plug against shear forces. It is a carrier protein for factor VIII and also protects it from proteolytic degradation \nand stabilizes it. The half-life of factor VIII is about 2.4 hours when free and 12 hours when bound \nto vWF in the circulation. Since vWF stabilizes factor VIII, a deficiency of vWF gives rise to a secondary decrease in factor \nVIII levels. This may be reflected by a prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) in \nvon Willebrand disease types 1 and 3. 421 \nSold by @itachibot",

The characteristics of different subtypes of vWD are: Type 1 is the most common subtype of vWD. In Type 2, vWF is expressed in normal amounts, but \nmissense mutations are present that lead to defective multimer assembly. This type has several \nsubtypes, of which type 2A is the most common. Laboratory findings in vWD: • Prolonged bleeding time • Normal platelet count • Hess test - positive tourniquet test due to defective platelet adhesion • Ristocetin-induced aggregation - defective and diagnostic of this disease • Platelet aggregation with ADP, collagen, and thrombin - normal • Increased aPTT Though the synthesis of factor VIII remains normal, the half-life of VIII in plasma decreases due \nto reduced vWF (carrier) levels. This leads to secondary VIIIC deficiency in plasma. So, the \nintrinsic pathway of coagulation is affected. Hence, aPTT is increased in these patients.

TTP is a part of a spectrum of clinical syndromes called thrombotic microangiopathy. They are \ncaused by insults that lead to excessive activation of platelets, which deposit as thrombi in small \nblood vessels. Features of TTP include: • Fever • Thrombocytopenia • Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia • Transient neurologic deficits • Renal failure 429 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and peripheral smear showing helmet cells or schistocytes are \nsuggestive of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition is most commonly associated \nwith enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain O157: H7 worldwide. This strain releases Shiga-like toxin. This toxin is absorbed from the inflamed gastrointestinal \nmucosa into the circulation and causes endothelial dysfunction. It leads to platelet activation and \naggregation. Children and older adults are at the highest risk. The image given below shows schistocytes or helmet cells seen in HUS.",

      "explanation": "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is not associated with deficiency of CD59. It is associated with deficiency of the following components: • Complement factor H • Membrane cofactor protein (CD46) • Complement factor I These three proteins prevent excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. Deficiencies of these proteins can be caused by inherited defects or acquired inhibitory \nautoantibodies. The disease may be associated with a remitting, relapsing course.",

      "explanation": "Weber–Osler–Rendu syndrome is a disorder of the blood vessels. It is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations that modulate TGF- signalling. It is \nalso known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This condition is characterized by dilated, tortuous blood vessels with thin walls that bleed \nreadily. Bleeding is most common in the mucous membranes of the nose (epistaxis), tongue, \nmouth, and eyes, and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are \nnormal. Clinical conditions in which abnormalities of vessel wall cause bleeding include: • Infections - meningococcemia, infective endocarditis, rickettsioses • Collagen defects - Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, scurvy, and Cushing's syndrome • Perivascular amyloidosis - most common with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis • Henoch–Schönlein purpura • Drug reactions 431 \nSold by @itachibot Coagulation Pathway Disorders",
