It is part of a larger family of structurally \nunique serine protease inhibitors, referred to as serpins. The most common clinically significant \nmutation in 1-antitrypsin deficiency is PiZZ. 1-antitrypsin, normally present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages is a major inhibitor of \nproteases (particularly elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. The absence of 1- \nantitrypsin activity results in excessive digestion of elastic tissue by elastase. Patients with 1-antitrypsin deficiency have a markedly increased tendency to develop panacinar \nemphysema.",

Asthma is characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction caused by airway hyperresponsiveness \nto a variety of stimuli. Atopic asthma is caused by a TH2 and IgE-mediated immunologic reaction \nto environmental allergens (type-1 hypersensitivity reaction). Triggers for non-atopic asthma are \nless clear but include viral infections and inhaled air pollutants. Genetic susceptibility for developing asthma: • Chromosome 5q - site of the susceptibility locus for asthma • IL-13 gene polymorphisms (on 5q chromosome) - most consistent associations with asthma or \nallergic disease • IL-4 receptor gene variants - associated with atopy, elevated total serum IgE, and asthma The sputum of patients with bronchial asthma shows: • Charcot–Leyden crystals - made of an eosinophilic membrane protein called galectin 10 • Curschmann spirals - spirals of mucus plugs from subepithelial mucous gland ducts or \nbronchioles 1099 \nSold by @itachibot • Creola bodies - desquamated epithelial cells • Numerous eosinophils Note: The hygiene hypothesis was previously used to explain the development of asthma and \nother hypersensitivity disorders.",

Bronchiectasis is a suppurative lung disease with abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the \nbronchi. It is an end-stage condition of various diseases that result in destruction of the bronchial \nwall and its surrounding supporting tissues. The normal clearing mechanisms are impaired, either due to congenital causes or due to bronchial \nobstruction. This results in pooling of secretions, secondary infection, and inflammation, often \nwith necrosis, fibrosis, and eventually cystic dilation of airways up to four times the normal size.

The resected specimen had a hilar \nlymph node that was 1cm in size and showed a black pigment. What is the black pigment \nlikely to be?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "1109 \nSold by @itachibot The black-colored pigment in the hilar lymph node of the resected bronchoscopic specimen is \nlikely to be an anthracotic pigment. The black color is due to the deposition of carbon particles. The inhaled carbon particles are \nengulfed by the lung macrophages and then transported to the hilar lymph nodes. \nThis accumulates and causes the blackening of the lung tissues or anthracosis. It is commonly seen in people who work in environments where there is high air pollution with \ncarbon particles, such as coal mines. It is also the most common exogenous pigment found in the \nhuman body as a result of air pollution in urban areas. The aggregates of the carbon dust may \ninduce fibroblastic reaction or emphysema that may lead to a condition called coal worker's \npneumoconiosis. The following image shows anthracosis with deposition of black carbon particles, within the \ncytoplasm of macrophages. 1110 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Melanin is brown-black in color which occurs as a result of oxidation of tyrosine in \nmelanocytes, as shown in the following histopathology of a lymph node. Option C: Lipochrome or lipofuscin (brown lipid) is seen as a yellow-brown pigment in \nhistopathological sections of the liver and heart of normal aging patients, patients with severe \nmalnutrition, and cancer cachexia. It is derived through lipid peroxidation and indicates free \nradical injury and lipid peroxidation. The following image shows a cardiac myocyte with fine \nyellow-brown lipofuscin granules in the perinuclear region. 1111 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Hemosiderin is a hemoglobin-derived golden-yellow colored pigment seen in conditions \nassociated with iron overload such as hemochromatosis. The following image shows extensive \nintra-alveolar hemosiderin deposition following pulmonary hemorrhage. 1112 \nSold by @itachibot Lung tumors",
