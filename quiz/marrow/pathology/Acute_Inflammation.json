      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are not involved in phagocytosis. This is because the nuclei \nof the neutrophils are lost during NET formation, leading to their death. Hence, they cannot \nphagocytose pathogens. NETs are networks of extracellular fibers that consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear \nchromatin. They trap microbes at sites of infection, preventing their further spread. They \nalso contain a high concentration of antimicrobial proteins like neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, \nand histones that have a high affinity for DNA. They are produced by neutrophils in response to the following triggers: • Pathogens - Mainly bacteria and fungi • Inflammatory mediators - • Chemokines • Cytokines (mainly interferons) • Complement proteins • Reactive oxygen species NETs have also been detected in the blood during sepsis. In this condition, platelet activation is \ninvolved in NET formation 86 \nSold by @itachibot The nuclear chromatin in the NETs is a source of nuclear antigens (histones and associated DNA) \nin systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This triggers \nautoantibody production and further clinical manifestations. 87 \nSold by @itachibot Inflammatory Mediators and Granulomatous Inflammation",
