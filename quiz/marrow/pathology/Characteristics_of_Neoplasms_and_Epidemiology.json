      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Cancer cells are insensitive to growth-inhibitory signals. All cancer cells are known to show around 8 fundamental physiological changes in the cell, which \nare considered as the hallmarks of cancer. These changes include the following: • Self-sufficiency in growth signals - once activated, tumors can proliferate without external \nstimuli • Insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals - tumors do not respond to inhibitors of cell growth. \nThis is attributed to the inactivation of the tumor-suppressor genes in cancer cells • Altered cellular metabolism - tumor cells switch to aerobic glycolysis, called the Warburg effect • Evasion of apoptosis • Limitless replicative potential • Sustained angiogenesis • Ability to invade and metastasis • Ability to evade the host immune response",

      "explanation": "Increased conversion of glucose to lactic acid is done via the glycolytic pathway (not HMP). Even in the presence of ample oxygen, cancer cells demonstrate a distinctive form of cellular \nmetabolism. This is characterized by high levels of glucose uptake and increased conversion of \nglucose to lactic acid via the glycolytic pathway. This phenomenon is called the Warburg effect. Aerobic glycolysis provides rapidly dividing tumor cells with metabolic intermediates that are \nrequired for the synthesis of cellular components, whereas mitochondrial oxidative phosphor- \nylation□ does not.",
