      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Cyclophosphamide is a directly-acting carcinogen that does not require metabolic activation. Carcinogens can be direct-acting or indirect-acting based on their activation. Direct-acting carcinogens require no metabolic conversion to become carcinogenic. Most are weak \ncarcinogens, but some are important because they are cancer chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., 245 \nSold by @itachibot alkylating agents). The direct-acting carcinogens include: • Alkylating Agents: •  -Propiolactone • Dimethyl sulfate • Diepoxybutane • Anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, nitrosoureas, and others) • Acylating Agents: • 1-Acetyl-imidazole • Dimethylcarbamyl chloride Indirect-acting carcinogens (procarcinogens) are chemicals that require metabolic conversion to \nbecome active carcinogens. The carcinogenic product of metabolism is called an ultimate \ncarcinogen. The indirect-acting carcinogens include: • Polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: • Benz[a]anthracene • Benzo[a]pyrene • Dibenz[a,h]anthracene • 3-Methylcholanthrene • 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene • Aromatic amines, amides, azo dyes: • 2-Naphthylamine ( -naphthylamine) • Benzidine • 2-Acetylaminofluorene • Dimethylaminoazobenzene (butter yellow) • Natural plant and microbial products: • Aflatoxin B1 • Griseofulvin • Cycasin • Safrole • Betel nuts • Others • Nitrosamine and amides • Vinyl chloride, nickel, chromium • Insecticides, fungicides • Polychlorinated biphenyls 246 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "UVB (ultraviolet B) causes cutaneous cancers due to the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA. When DNA absorbs energy from UVB, there is a covalent crosslinking of pyrimidine bases and \ndistortion of the DNA helix. This prevents proper pairing of the dimer with bases in the opposite \nDNA strand. Normally, these defects are repaired by nucleotide excision repair pathway. Defects in nucleotide \nexcision repair pathway result in xeroderma pigmentosum.

EBV genome \ntriggers B-cell signaling pathways inducing B-cell growth and transformation. The infection of B cells is latent as there is no viral replication and the cells are not \nkilled. However, B cells latently infected with EBV express viral proteins that result in the ability \nto propagate indefinitely in vitro. In the absence of T-cell immunity, EBV-infected B cells can \nrapidly grow out as aggressive B-cell tumors. 249 \nSold by @itachibot",

Polycythemia, as a paraneoplastic syndrome, is mediated by erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is a \nglycoprotein that induces differentiation of erythrocyte colony-forming units in the bone marrow 253 \nSold by @itachibot to promote red blood cell production. Under normal physiological conditions, EPO is produced by peritubular renal interstitial cells in \nresponse to local tissue hypoxia. However, in tumors, EPO production occurs in the neoplastic \ncells themselves.",

      "explanation": "The serum levels of catecholamines are elevated in malignant pheochromocytoma. Extra-adrenal \nlocation is the only criteria for malignancy in pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor that may precipitate life-threatening \nhypertension. It is classically associated with three syndromes: • von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome • Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) • Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Catecholamines produced by pheochromocytomas are metabolized within chromaffin cells. \nNorepinephrine is metabolized to normetanephrine, and epinephrine is metabolized to \nmetanephrine. Because this process occurs within the tumor, independent of catecholamine \nrelease, pheochromocytomas are best diagnosed by the measurement of these metabolites, rather \nthan by measurement of the parent catecholamines. 254 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "NRG-1 (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). GIST are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen, the stomach being the most \ncommon site. They arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST is \nseen in the 5th to 6th decade of life and has an equal preponderance among males and females. \nMost patients present with haematemesis, melena, or vague abdominal pain. The most common \nindications for surgery include bleeding and obstruction. The GIST may occur in a sporadic form or as part of familial syndromes. In sporadic GIST, the \nmost common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRA \nmutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has elongated spindle cells or plumper epithelioid cells, or a \nmixed pattern. The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of \nspindle-shaped tumor cells. 256 \nSold by @itachibot Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with Carney \ntriad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Imatinib can be used to treat GIST with mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Succinate dehydrogenase \n(SDH) - deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be used \ninstead. During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causes \nseeding of nearby tissues leading to relapse in 100% of the cases. If capsule rupture occurs, \nadjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent. Other options: Option A: KIT (CD117): This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs show \nmutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT is \na receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs. Option B: SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs, \nparticularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic of \nthis subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry. Option C: PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRA \ngene account for approximately 5-10% of GISTs. Similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosine \nkinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GISTs. 257 \nSold by @itachibot Components of Immune System",
