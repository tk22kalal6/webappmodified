      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The x-ray image of the hip shows narrowing of the joint space and subchondral sclerosis which is \ndiagnostic of osteoarthritis (OA), also called degenerative joint disease. OA is the most common type of joint disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of joint \ncartilage. This results in structural and functional failure of synovial joints. Osteoarthritis can be \nclassified into 2 types: • Primary OA: Insidious onset, without apparent initiating cause, as an aging phenomenon • Secondary OA: Predisposing conditions such as joint deformity, a previous joint injury, or an \nunderlying systemic disease such as diabetes, ochronosis, hemochromatosis, or marked obesity. The knees and hands are more commonly affected in women and the hips in men. OA lesions \noccur due to the degeneration of the articular cartilage and its disordered repair. Inflammatory \ncells are sparse, but cytokines and diffusible factors, particularly TGF- (which induces matrix \nmetalloproteinases), TNF, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide, have been implicated in OA.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's serum will test \npositive for rheumatoid factor. Microscopy of the excised nodule shows a necrotizing granuloma with a central zone of fibrinoid \nnecrosis surrounded by a prominent rim of activated macrophages and numerous lymphocytes \nand plasma cells. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of autoimmune origin that \nprincipally attacks the joints, producing nonsuppurative, proliferative, and inflammatory \nsynovitis. The inflammation progresses to the destruction of the articular cartilage and ankylosis \nof the joints. In RA, the synovium contains germinal centers with secondary follicles and abundant plasma \ncells, which produce antibodies, some are autoantibodies. Many of the autoantibodies produced in \nthe lymphoid organs are specific for citrullinated peptides (CCPs). 80% of patients have serum \nIgM or IgA autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portions of their own IgG. These autoantibodies are \ncalled rheumatoid factor and may also deposit in joints as immune complexes The characteristic histologic features of RA include: • Synovial cell hyperplasia and proliferation • Dense inflammatory infiltrates • Increased vascularity due to angiogenesis • Fibrinopurulent exudate on the synovial and joint surfaces • Osteoclastic activity in underlying bone • Subcutaneous nodule: necrotizing granulomas with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis \nsurrounded activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells 1247 \nSold by @itachibot This altogether leads to a mass of edematous synovium called pannus, which grows over the \narticular cartilage and causes its erosion.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is gout. Aspirate from the joint shows dense neutrophilic infiltrate and \ncrystals that are long, slender, needle-shaped, and negatively birefringent. Gout is marked by transient attacks of acute arthritis initiated by crystallization of monosodium \nurate (MSU) within and around joints. This results in the production of cytokines that recruit \nleukocytes. Macrophages phagocytose the MSU and the inflammasome activates caspase-1, which \nis involved in the production of some biologically active cytokines. The distinctive morphologic changes in gout are acute arthritis, chronic tophaceous arthritis, \ntophi in various sites, and gouty nephropathy. Tophi are the pathognomonic hallmark of gout. \nThese are large aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction of \nforeign body giant cells which may appear in the articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bursae, \nearlobes, fingertips, or kidneys. Gouty nephropathy refers to the renal complications caused by MSU crystals or tophi in the renal \nmedullary interstitium or tubules. Complications include uric acid nephrolithiasis and \npyelonephritis.",
