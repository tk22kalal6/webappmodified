It is an indicator of free radical injury to the cells. It is an insoluble, brownish yellow, granular intracellular material that is seen in the liver, \nbrain, and heart due to normal aging. The brown pigment in large amounts can give a \ncharacteristic appearance to the tissue called brown atrophy. It can also be seen in patients with severe malnutrition and cancer cachexia.",

It \nmay also occur in the heart, muscles, and kidneys. The most common form of lipid accumulation is triglycerides.

Metastatic calcification can occur throughout the body, but it mainly affects: • Interstitial tissues of the vasculature • Kidneys • Lungs • Gastric mucosa The calcium deposits morphologically resemble those described in dystrophic calcification. \nAlthough they generally do not cause clinical dysfunction, extensive calcifications in the lungs may \nbe evident on radiographs and may produce respiratory distress.

Normally, with every cell division, there is some shortening of telomeres at the ends of \nchromosomes.

Telomerase is the enzyme that prevents the shortening of telomeres. This enzyme is usually \npresent in germ cells but is absent in most somatic cells.

      "explanation": "A frozen section is done for the fixation of fats. This ensures that the tissue need not go through \nroutine processing, which can remove lipids. When the tissue sample goes through rapid freezing, it becomes firmer. The ice acts as an \nembedding media allowing the tissue to be sectioned. The temperature range in the cryostat machine usually ranges from 0■C to -35■C. The majority \nof the tissue can be appropriately sectioned between -15■C to -25■C. Tissue samples that contain \nwater can be sectioned at a higher temperature. The tissues that contain more fat will need to be \ncut at a lower temperature. The stain used for fat is the oil red O stain. It can identify neutral lipids and fatty acids in smears \nand tissues. It is used in the following conditions: • Fat emboli in lung tissue • Renal cell carcinoma • Sebaceous gland tumors of the skin • Lipid-rich carcinomas Fixatives containing alcohols, or routine processing with clearing, will remove lipids.
