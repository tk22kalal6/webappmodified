      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of anaphylaxis following a bee sting. This is an example of \nIgE-mediated reaction or type 1 hypersensitivity. Injurious immune reactions are called hypersensitivity reactions. There are four types of \nhypersensitivity reactions. Immediate (Type 1) hypersensitivity is also called allergic reactions. They are induced by \nenvironmental antigens (allergens) that stimulate strong TH2 responses and IgE production in \ngenetically susceptible individuals. IgE coats mast cells by binding to Fcg receptors. Reexposure to the allergen leads to cross-linking \nof the IgE and FcRI, activation of mast cells, and release of mediators. The principal mediators \nare histamine, proteases, and other granule contents like prostaglandins and leukotrienes \nand cytokines. It occurs in two phases: immediate phase and late phase. The mediators are responsible for the \nimmediate vascular and smooth muscle reactions and the late-phase reaction (inflammation). The \nclinical manifestations may be local or systemic and range from mildly annoying rhinitis to fatal \nanaphylaxis. The image given below shows the sequence of events in immediate hypersensitivity. 280 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Arthus reaction is characterized by a localized area of tissue necrosis due to \nimmune-complex-mediated (type III hypersensitivity reaction) vasculitis in the skin. This reaction can be produced experimentally by intracutaneous injection of antigen in a \npreviously immunised animal that contains circulating antibodies against the antigen. As the \nantigen diffuses into the vessel wall, it binds with the preformed antibody, and immune \ncomplexes are formed locally. These complexes precipitate in the vessel walls and cause fibrinoid \nnecrosis.",

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that is usually associated with autoantibodies \ndirected against acetylcholine receptors. In Type II hypersensitivity, antibodies react with \nantigens present on cell surfaces or in the extracellular matrix cause.

In a previously sensitized \nindividual, reddening and induration of the site appear in 8 to 12 hours, reach a peak in 24 to 72 \nhours, and thereafter slowly subside. Morphologically, delayed-type hypersensitivity is characterized by the accumulation of \nmononuclear cells, mainly CD4+ T cells and macrophages, around venules.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Anaphylactoid reactions are those reactions that are similar to the anaphylactic reactions but are \nnot IgE mediated. These reactions are caused by direct degranulation of the mast cells or \nbasophils, which causes the release of mediators. Unlike the classic anaphylaxis which occurs on re-exposure to the allergen, the anaphylactoid \nreaction can occur even on the first exposure. The most common agents that can cause an \nanaphylactoid reaction include NSAIDs and radiocontrast media. In 2014, World Allergy Organisation has introduced two new terms: • Immunologic anaphylaxis - It includes anaphylactic reactions mediated by IgE, IgG (in animals), \nand immune complex/ complement-mediated reactions. • Non-immunologic anaphylaxis (previously called anaphylactoid reaction) - It includes reactions \ncaused by agents which cause massive degranulation of mast cells or basophils in the absence of \nimmunoglobulin.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The above process is called central tolerance and the AIRE (AutoImmune REgulator) protein is \nnecessary for this process. Immature self-reactive T and B lymphocyte clones recognize self-antigens during their maturation \nin the central lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells). They are killed or \nrendered harmless. The removal of self reacting T lymphocytes in the thymus is called negative selection/ deletion. For \nthis process, AIRE protein is needed. Mutations in the AIRE gene results in autoimmune \ndisorders (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy). B cells undergo a process called receptor editing. When developing B cells encounter an antigen, it \nformulates a change in the receptor that makes the antigen unrecognizable. Self-reacting B cells \ncan also undergo apoptosis.",

      "explanation": "Autoimmunity in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is the result of polyclonal B cell activation. Microbes may induce other abnormalities that promote autoimmune reactions. Some viruses, \nsuch as EBV and HIV, cause polyclonal B-cell activation, which may result in the production of \nautoantibodies. The role of infections in autoimmunity is exemplified by the following: • Molecular mimicry of antigenic cross-reactivity: The structural similarity of the microbial \nantigens and self-antigens. Rheumatic heart disease is an example in which streptococcal proteins \ncross-react with myocardial proteins causing myocarditis. • Upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules by infectious organisms. • Polyclonal B cell activation: Caused by EBV and HIV, resulting in the production of \nautoantibodies. • Alteration of tissue antigens: Infections may alter tissue self-antigens so that they activate T cells \nand lose the property of self-tolerance.",
