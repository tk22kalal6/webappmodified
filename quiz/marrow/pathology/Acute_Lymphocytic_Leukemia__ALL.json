      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is not a preleukemic condition. It is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to IgG autoantibodies that bind to the P blood group \nantigen and cause intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Most cases are seen in children \nand show recovery within a month. Option A: Few patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) develop acute \nnon-lymphocytic leukemia. This is thought to arise from the injured marrow as a secondary \nhematopoietic disorder. Option B: Bone marrow aplasia preceding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare condition \nthat usually affects children. It generally follows the recovery of normal blood counts and most \ncommonly occurs within 6 months of the onset of aplasia. Option C: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 10% to 40% of individuals with \nmyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It is usually accompanied by the appearance of additional \ncytogenetic abnormalities.",
