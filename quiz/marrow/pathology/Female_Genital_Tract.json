      "explanation": "Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors (MMMTs) are carcinosarcomas whose genetic profile \nclosely resembles endometrial carcinomas. They involve mutations in the same genes - PTEN, TP53, and PIK3CA. The usual genetic \nalterations found in sarcomas are absent in MMMTs. MMMTs are endometrial adenocarcinomas with malignant mesenchymal components. The \nmesenchymal component may resemble uterine mesenchymal elements (stromal sarcoma, \nleiomyosarcoma) or contain heterologous malignant cell types (striated muscle, cartilage, adipose \ntissue, and bone). It occurs in postmenopausal women and presents with bleeding. It is associated with a poor \noutcome.",

      "explanation": "The given histopathological image shows large cells with clear cytoplasm (fried egg appearance), \ntumor cells arranged in sheets, and cords of fibrous stroma infiltrated by lymphocytes. These \nfindings are suggestive of dysgerminoma. It is highly responsive to radiotherapy. Dysgerminomas are the ovarian counterparts of testicular seminoma. They may occur in \nchildhood, but most commonly occur in the 2-3rd decades. It may occur in patients with gonadal \ndysgenesis, including pseudohermaphroditism. The majority of these tumors are unilateral. They \nexpress OCT-3, OCT4, and NANOG. All dysgerminomas are malignant, but the degree of histologic atypia is variable. Only about \none-third of these lesions are aggressive. These neoplasms are responsive to chemoradiation, and \noverall survival exceeds 80%. 877 \nSold by @itachibot 878 \nSold by @itachibot Male Genital Tract",
