It is the most common type of hereditary neuropathy. The most common variant of this \ncondition is CMT1A. It is caused by a duplication of a region on chromosome 17 that includes the \nperipheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. It usually presents in the first to third decade of life with distal leg weakness, e.g., foot drop with \nno numbness or tingling. There is reduced sensation to all modalities with reduced muscle stretch \nreflexes. Atrophy of the muscles below the knee leads to inverted champagne bottle legs. 1339 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of myasthenia gravis. It is most commonly associated \nwith thymic hyperplasia (65% of cases). Thymoma is seen in around 10% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by weakness and \nthe fatigability of skeletal muscles. It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of \nthe acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. This consequentially leads to \na decreased transmission at the neuromuscular (myoneural) junction. There is a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement. Lid and extraocular muscles (diplopia and \nptosis) are involved early in the disease course. The facial muscles weakness can produce a \nsnarling expression, weakness in chewing, and nasal timbre to the voice. Weakness increases with \nrepeated use of the muscles and improves with rest.

It is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine release by inhibiting a \npresynaptic calcium channel. In contrast to myasthenia gravis, rapid, repetitive \nstimulation (muscle activity) results in an increase in muscle response and strength. Patients typically present with weakness of their extremities. In about half the cases, there is an \nunderlying malignancy; most often, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (Small cell lung \ncarcinoma). The stimulus for autoantibody formation in paraneoplastic cases may be the \nexpression of the same calcium channel in the neoplastic cells. 1340 \nSold by @itachibot Patients without cancer often have other autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo or thyroid \ndisease. Treatment consists of drugs that increase acetylcholine release by depolarizing synaptic \nmembranes (pyridostigmine), plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive agents, similar to \nmyasthenia gravis.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical history and the image showing pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles are highly \nsuggestive of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. It is an X-linked recessive condition. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the \ndystrophin gene on the X chromosome. It is one of the largest human genes. Dystrophin \nprovides mechanical stability to the myofiber during muscle contraction. Defects in the complex \nmay lead to small membrane tears that permit the influx of calcium, triggering events that result \nin myofiber degeneration. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is associated with deletions or frame-shift mutations that result \nin the total absence of dystrophin. Immunohistochemical studies for dystrophin show the absence \nof the normal sarcolemmal staining pattern. In contrast, the mutations in Becker's muscular dystrophy typically permit the synthesis of a \ntruncated version of dystrophin, which retains some function. Immunohistochemical studies for \ndystrophin show reduced staining.",
