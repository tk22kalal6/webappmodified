Zone 3 \n(centrilobular zone) of the liver is most susceptible for ischemia because this zone is the farthest \nfrom the blood supply. On the basis of blood flow, liver parenchyma can be divided into three zones. Zone 1 is closest to \nthe blood supply and zone 3 is the farthest. They are: • Zone 1 - Periportal (around portal triad) • Zone 2 - Midzonal parenchyma • Zone 3 - Centrilobular (around hepatic vein) A schematic diagram showing the hepatic lobule indicating the direction of blood flow and the \nzones of decreasing oxygenation is given below.
