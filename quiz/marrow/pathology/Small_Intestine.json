      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children &lt; 2 years of age is \nintussusception. Intussusception occurs when a segment of the intestine, constricted by a wave of peristalsis, \ntelescopes into the immediately distal segment. It is usually idiopathic at younger ages. However, \nit can be associated with viral infections and rotavirus vaccines, perhaps due to reactive \nhyperplasia of Peyer patches. Untreated intussusception may progress to intestinal obstruction, compression of mesenteric \nvessels, and infarction. Note: The most common form of congenital intestinal atresia is imperforate anus. It occurs due to \nfailure of the cloacal diaphragm to involute. 1026 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. It is associated \nwith HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles. It is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods such \nas barley, rye, oats, and wheat (mnemonic: BROW) in genetically predisposed individuals. In these individuals, digestion of the gluten-containing diet leads to the formation of gliadin \npeptides. These peptides result in the following immune reactions: • They can activate the epithelial cells to express certain cytokines (IL-15), which result in CD8+ T \ncell proliferation • They undergo deamidation and interact with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on the antigen-presenting \ncells. This leads to CD4+ T cell stimulation and further cytokine production These mechanisms result in epithelial tissue damage. Antibodies associated with celiac disease are: • Anti-gliadin antibodies • Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-ttG) • Anti-endomysial antibodies Microscopic findings include: • Villi atrophy and flattening • Crypt hyperplasia • Increased intraepithelial T cells",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In cystic fibrosis, malabsorption occurs due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, not intestinal \nmucosal defects. Cystic fibrosis is caused by pathogenic mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7 that \nencodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The absence of CFTR protein interferes with Na+, HCO3-, and water secretion resulting in \ndefective luminal hydration. This causes the formation of pancreatic intraductal concretions and \ncauses exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.",

The diagnosis can be confirmed by acid-fast staining. Distended foamy macrophages inside the lamina propria of the duodenum can be seen in: • Whipple's disease • Intestinal tuberculosis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts As both organisms are PAS-positive, PAS staining cannot differentiate between the two diseases. \nOn the other hand, acid-fast staining can be used to confirm the diagnosis, as only mycobacteria \nare acid fast, whereas Tropheryma whipplei is not.",

Rotavirus is a common cause of severe childhood diarrhea and diarrheal mortality worldwide. \nRotavirus selectively infects and destroys mature enterocytes in the small intestine.
