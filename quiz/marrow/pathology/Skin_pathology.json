These cells are located in epithelial basal cell layer and have neuroendocrine and \nmechanoreceptor functions. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin, most commonly \nfound in white men and diagnosed at a mean age of 70 years. A rapidly growing, flesh-colored 1268 \nSold by @itachibot papule or plaque characterizes the disease. About 80% of the cases are seen associated with \nMerkel cell polyomavirus. Regional lymph nodes are involved in 30% of the patients and 50% will develop systemic \ndisease. CK-20 is a specific marker for Merkel cell carcinoma. Wide local excision is usually \nnecessary.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Nevus cells often become non-pigmented and resemble neural tissue as they grow deep into the \ndermis. This change is called neurotization and suggests the benign nature of the nevus. This morphological change in nevus cells occurs due to progressive loss of tyrosinase activity and \nacquisition of cholinesterase activity in deeper “nervelike” nevus cells. Melanocytic nevi (moles) are common benign neoplasms caused by acquired activating mutations \nin components of the RAS signaling pathway. Based on the location, it may be junctional nevi, intradermal nevi, or compound nevi. Melanocytic nevi are thought to progress through a series of morphologic changes over time. \nSuperficial nevus cells are larger, tend to produce melanin, and grow in nests. Deeper nevus cells \nare smaller, produce little or no pigment, and appear as cords and single cells. At the deepest \nextent of the lesions, these cells often acquire fusiform contours and grow in fascicles resembling \nneural tissue (neurotization). Melanocytic nevi with neurotization indicate normal maturation change and help in \ndifferentiating benign nevi from melanomas (which lacks such features). 1269 \nSold by @itachibot",

Immunohistochemistry markers for melanoma are: • S-100 • HMB (Human Melanoma Black)-45 • LDH • MELAN-A Regression is defined as partial or complete disappearance of a previously documented tumor in \nthe absence of therapeutic interventions or physical trauma. Microscopically, it is characterized by \nthe replacement of melanoma cells by dense inflammtory cell infiltrate or dermal fibrosis. This phenomenon explains some apparent discrepancies between expected and observed \nprognosis based on tumor thickness and also the cases of metastatic melanoma with occult \nprimary. Determinants of a more favorable prognosis in melanoma include: • Thinner tumor depth • No or very few mitoses (&lt; 1 per mm2) • A brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocyte response • The absence of regression • Lack of ulceration • Absence of metastases in the sentinel lymph node",
