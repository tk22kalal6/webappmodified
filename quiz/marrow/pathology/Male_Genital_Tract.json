      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given histopathological features are strongly suggestive of cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism is histopathologically characterized by the following: • Testicular atrophy: thickening of the basement membrane, arrested germ cell development, \nmarked hyalinization • Tubules showing Sertoli cells but no spermatogenesis • Increase in the interstitial Leydig cells. Cryptorchidism is the failure of the descent of the intra-abdominal testes into the scrotal sac. It is \nthe most common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract. The testes can arrest \nanywhere during descent, and the most common site is the inguinal region. Phases of testicular descent: • Transabdominal phase: Testes come to lie in the lower abdomen or pelvis. This phase of descent \nis regulated by Mullerian-inhibiting substances. • Inguinoscrotal phase: Testes descend along the inguinal canal and reach the scrotal sac. This \nphase of the descent is regulated by androgen-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide from the 890 \nSold by @itachibot genitofemoral nerve. The exact pathogenesis remains unknown, however, deficiency in gonadotropins and \nMullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta are \nthought to play a role. It is associated with testicular atrophy and dysfunction, which result in \nsterility. Cryptorchid testes carry a 3–5-fold higher risk for testicular cancer (usually seminoma).",

The below image shows normal histology of testis: 892 \nSold by @itachibot In normal males, as spermatogenesis and testosterone production increase, the Sertoli cells \nproduce inhibin, which inhibits the release of FSH. The Sertoli cells are supporting cells that are \nunder the action of FSH. Leydig cells, which are present in the interstitial spaces, are under the \naction of luteinizing hormone(LH) and produce testosterone. Testosterone has a feedback \ninhibition on LH. In Sertoli cell-only syndrome, within the seminiferous tubules, only Sertoli cells are seen and no \ngerm cells. Hence, there are no spermatozoa and there is no feedback inhibition, which results in \nincreased FSH levels. So, testosterone levels, and LH levels remain unaffected since Leydig cells \nare not affected. Hence, the patient will have male secondary sexual characters.

In advanced stages, the testis is \nmarkedly enlarged and consists entirely of soft, necrotic, hemorrhagic tissue. 893 \nSold by @itachibot Adult torsion is typically seen in adolescence and presents with the sudden onset of testicular \npain. Neonatal torsion can occur either in utero or shortly after birth and the cause is unknown. It results from a bilateral anatomic defect that leads to increased mobility of the testes (bell- \nclapper□ abnormality). Twisting of the spermatic cord typically cuts off the venous drainage of the \ntestis. But, thick-walled arteries remain patent, producing intense vascular engorgement, followed \nby hemorrhagic infarction. If the testis is manually untwisted within approximately 6 hours of the \nonset of torsion, there is a good chance that the testis will remain viable.",

The exceptions to this rule are: • Prepubertal yolk-sac tumors • Teratomas • Adult spermatocyte tumors The lesion consists of atypical primordial germ cells, which have large nuclei and a clear \ncytoplasm and fail to develop into spermatogonia.

It is characterized by benign, hyperplastic proliferation of prostatic stroma and \nepithelial elements, which is driven by dihydrotestosterone. This growth progressively compresses \nthe urethra resulting in urinary obstructive symptoms. The normal prostate contains several distinct regions, including a central zone (CZ), peripheral \nzone (PZ), transitional zone (TZ), and periurethral zone, as shown in the image below.
