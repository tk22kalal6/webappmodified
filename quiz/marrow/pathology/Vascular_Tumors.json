      "explanation": "The most common form of vascular ectasia is nevus flammeus. Vascular ectasias are the conditions involving the dilatation of blood vessels. They can be \ncongenital or acquired malformations or hamartomas. Telangiectasia is the permanent dilation of \nsmall blood vessels. They lead to red lesions in the skin or mucous membranes. Various types of vascular ectasias are as follows: • Nevus flammeus (birthmark): Pink/purple flat lesions on the head or neck. They regress \nspontaneously. Image showing nevus flammeus in a newborn: • Port-wine stain: A special form of nevus flammeus. It thickens the skin surface. It grows during \nchildhood and does not fade with time. Image showing port-wine stain in a child: 681 \nSold by @itachibot • Spider telangiectasias: They are pulsatile and blanch with pressure. These commonly occur on \nthe face, neck, or upper chest. They are associated with hyperestrogenic states, such as pregnancy \nor liver cirrhosis. • Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu disease) is caused by mutations in \ngenes related to the TGF- signaling pathway. It is characterized by dilated blood vessels with thin \nwalls that bleed easily. There can be bleeding from the mucous membranes of the nose (epistaxis), \ntongue, mouth, eyes, and the gastrointestinal tract.
