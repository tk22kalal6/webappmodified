      "explanation": "Vascular injury results in intimal thickening due to smooth muscle proliferation. Vascular injury stimulates the migration of smooth muscle cells of the tunica media to the tunica \nintima. These smooth muscle cells proliferate and also synthesize extracellular matrix leading to \nintimal thickening. This is the stereotypical response of the vessel wall to an injury regardless of \nthe cause of injury.

It progresses in the following sequence: • Endothelial injury and dysfunction • Accumulation of lipoproteins in the vessel wall • Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium • Platelet adhesion • Factor release from activated platelets, macrophages, and vascular wall cells • Smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and recruitment of T cells • Lipid accumulation both extracellularly and within cells • Calcification of ECM and necrotic debris late in the pathogenesis Hence, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and healing response of the arterial wall to \nendothelial injury. The two most important causes of endothelial injury leading to atherosclerosis \nare hemodynamic disturbances and hypercholesterolemia.

It is related to the familial \nclustering of other established risk factors, such as hypertension or diabetes. It may also be due to \ninherited variations in pathophysiologic processes such as inflammation. Hyperlipidemia (specifically hypercholesterolemia) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Even \nin the absence of other risk factors, hypercholesterolemia is sufficient to initiate lesion \ndevelopment. 638 \nSold by @itachibot",
