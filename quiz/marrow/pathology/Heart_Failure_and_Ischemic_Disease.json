It \ncontains connective tissue, a few cells, macrophages, mast cells, fibroblasts, and the nerves and \nvessels that supply the vascular wall. Cardiac valves are lined by endothelium and share a tri-layered architecture: • Fibrosa is a dense collagenous core at the outflow surface. It is connected to the valvular \nsupporting structures. • Spongiosa is a central core of loose connective tissue • Ventricularis or atrialis is a layer rich in elastin on the inflow surface. 701 \nSold by @itachibot",

Causes of diastolic heart failure: • Hypertension: most common • Diabetes mellitus • Obesity • Bilateral renal artery stenosis 703 \nSold by @itachibot Systolic failure is due to insufficient ejection fraction, i.e., pump failure.

      "explanation": "Isolated right-sided heart failure is not caused by left-sided heart failure. Isolated right-sided heart failure is not common and usually occurs in patients with disorders \naffecting the lungs. Therefore, it is often referred to as cor pulmonale. It is caused by disorders of \nthe lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. It is also caused by conditions causing \npulmonary vasoconstriction like obstructive sleep apnea and altitude sickness. Pulmonary hypertension is the common feature of these disorders, which leads to hypertrophy \nand dilation of the right side of the heart. Right-sided heart failure is most commonly caused by left-sided heart failure.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the image, the liver specimen shows a nutmeg liver appearance, which occurs in congestive \nhepatomegaly. This is secondary to passive congestion due to right heart failure. In right heart failure, there is congestion of hepatic and portal vessels, greatest around the central \nveins. This leads to increased liver size and weight. The pericentral zones become congested and \nred-brown. The periportal regions are normal coloured and tan. This leads to a nutmeg liver \nappearance. With longstanding failure, the central areas can become fibrotic, eventually \nculminating in cardiac cirrhosis. Pathological changes are also seen in the spleen and the gastrointestinal tract. Portal venous \nhypertension also causes the enlargement of the spleen, with platelet sequestration. This is known \nas congestive splenomegaly.

      "explanation": "Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution imparts a brick red colour to the viable non-infarcted \nmyocardium. The infarct appears unstained and pale. Myocardial infarcts &lt; 12 hours old are usually not apparent on gross examination. However, if \nthe infarct preceded death by 2 to 3 hours, it is possible to identify the area of necrosis. This is \ndone by immersing the tissue slices in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution. The histochemical stain imparts a brick-red colour to intact, noninfarcted myocardium. \nHere, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, activity is preserved. LDH leaks out through the damaged \nmembranes of dead cells, so an infarct appears as an unstained pale zone. The image given below shows an ischemic brain after immersion in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride \nsolution. The pale unstained region is the infarcted zone.",

      "explanation": "The earliest light microscopic change that can be observed in the heart of this patient is \nthe waviness of myocardial fibres. This is seen within ½-4 hours at the border of the infarct. These changes are a result of the forceful contractions of viable fibres. The contractions cause \nstretching and buckling of immediately adjacent, noncontractile dead fibres. Myocyte vacuolization or myocytolysis may also be seen in the infarct margins.

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, on post-MI day 7, troponin and LDH will be raised. Troponins are highly \nspecific for MI and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days. 710 \nSold by @itachibot Troponins are proteins that regulate calcium-mediated contraction of the cardiac and skeletal \nmuscles. It is the single biomarker preferred for diagnosing MI, late diagnosis of MI, and \ndiagnosis of reinfarction. Troponin I is more important than troponin T. Cardiac troponin increases rapidly in patients with reinfarction. Sometimes, the cardiac troponin \nconcentration is elevated, but stable or decreasing at the time of suspected reinfarction. Then \nthe diagnosis of reinfarction requires a 20% or greater increase in the cTn measurement. Myoglobin is the earliest enzyme to increase after MI. It is a protein that is found in the skeletal \nand cardiac muscles, which binds oxygen. It is a very sensitive indicator of muscle injury. But it is \nnot specific to cardiac muscle and can be elevated to any form of injury to skeletal muscle. \nMyoglobin and SGOT levels come to baseline before day 1.",

Long QT syndrome manifests as arrhythmias associated with excessive prolongation of cardiac \nrepolarization. Stress-induced syncope or sudden cardiac death (SCD), are common presentations. Short QT syndrome presents with arrhythmias associated with abbreviated repolarization \nintervals. They also present with palpitations, syncope, and SCD. 711 \nSold by @itachibot Brugada syndrome manifests as ECG abnormalities like ST-segment elevations and right \nbundle-branch block. This occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. Here, patients \nclassically present with syncope or SCD during rest or sleep or after large meals. Familial atrial fibrillation is caused by a gain of function mutation in genes coding potassium \nchannels.",

On microscopic examination, the irreversibly injured myocytes exhibit contraction bands that are \nintensely eosinophilic intracellular stripes.
