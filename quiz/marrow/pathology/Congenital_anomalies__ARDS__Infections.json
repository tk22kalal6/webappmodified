      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Neuroendocrine cells in the bronchial mucosa of the lungs are called Kulchitsky cells. Bronchial mucosa contains a population of neuroendocrine cells that have neurosecretory-type \ngranules and can release a variety of factors including serotonin, calcitonin, and gastrin-releasing \npeptide (bombesin). The main cell types of the bronchial mucosa are: • Clara cells - non-ciliated cuboidal epithelial cells that secrete important defence markers and \nserve as progenitor cells after injury • Type I pneumocytes - seen in the alveolar epithelium and are responsible for gas exchange • Type II pneumocytes - seen in the alveolar epithelium and produce surfactants • Basal cells • Neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky-type) cells • Ciliated cells • Serous cells • Goblet cells 1069 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Pores of Kohn (alveolar pores) are seen in the alveolar wall. They are the interalveolar connections that permit the passage of bacteria and exudate between \nadjacent alveoli. This plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lobar pneumonia. During \nthe gray hepatization phase, fibrin also spreads through these pores. When the lung is partially deflated, collateral ventilation can also occur to some extent through \nthese pores.",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is characteristic of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline \nmembrane disease.

      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of surfactant dysfunction disorder. It is most commonly caused \nby mutations of ABCA3 gene. In this disorder, lack of production of surfactant leads to severe respiratory failure in neonates. \nThere is transient improvement with administration of exogenous surfactant, but it worsens once \nsurfactant therapy is stopped.

      "options": {
        "a": "The cause of death likely a malignant pleural effusion",
        "b": "The spread is mostly due to lymphatic dissemination",
        "c": "Pancytopenia may be seen due to infiltration of the bone marrow",
        "d": "It is a form of disseminated extrapulmonary tuberculosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given history, clinical features, and chest X-Ray point towards a diagnosis of miliary \ntuberculosis. Pancytopenia may be seen due to infiltration of the bone marrow in such cases. The second X-ray shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Chest x-ray appearance of \nARDS varies depending on the severity and typically appears as bilateral diffuse alveolar \nopacities with dependent atelectasis in some cases. The opacities may have a patchy ground-glass \nappearance. The cause of death here is likely ARDS. (option A) In immunodeficient individuals (eg.- patient having HIV), there may occur widespread \ndissemination of M. tuberculosis, via the hematogenous route (option B) that leads to the seeding \nof bacteria in various organs (hepatosplenomegaly). This is known as miliary TB. It is a form of disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis, and not extrapulmonary (option D) 1082 \nSold by @itachibot The risk factors of miliary TB include- • Extremes of age • Alcohol use • Malignancy • HIV • Corticosteroids • Connective tissue disease • Renal failure • Diabetes, and pregnancy",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Diffuse alveolar damage may be seen in patients suffering from COVID-19, on histological \nanalysis. It is the most common lung finding in COVID-19 pneumonia. Other COVID-19 related histopathological changes in the lungs include: • Hyaline membrane formation • Desquamation of pneumocytes • Fibrin deposits in lungs • Inflammation with mononuclear cells However, diffuse alveolar damage is not specific to COVID-19. It may be seen in all cases of acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) including pneumonia, burns, near drowning, etc. 1083 \nSold by @itachibot Obstructive and Restrictive lung diseases",
