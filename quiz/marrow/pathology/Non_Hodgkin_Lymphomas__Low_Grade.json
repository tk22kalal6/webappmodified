Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are usually seen. • Total blood count: • Total leukocyte count is highly variable; leukopenia is seen when the marrow is involved. • Hypogammaglobulinemia is common and contributes to increased susceptibility to infections. • 10% to 15% of patients develop hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia due \nto autoantibodies made by nonneoplastic B cells. • Peripheral smear: • Predominantly shows small lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm • Smudge cells or basket cells or parachute cells - artifacts of the lymphocytes which are disrupted \nduring the process of making smears. • Contains a large number of monotonous, uniform-looking, mature lymphocytes, which is often \ndescribed as a convent-girl appearance. • Spherocytes (due to coexisting autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and nucleated RBCs (due to \npremature release of progenitors in face of severe anemia, marrow infiltration by the tumor, or \nboth) • Lymph node biopsy: • Diffuse effacement composed of small lymphocytes admixed with variable numbers of larger \nactivated lymphocytes that often gather in loose aggregates • Referred to as proliferation centers, which contain mitotically active cells.

Signals from the \nantigen-stimulated T helper cells, drive the growth and survival of the clonal B-cells. At this stage, \nit is reversible, as in gastric MALToma after antibiotics against Helicobacter pylori. With time tumour cells may acquire mutations that render their growth and survival \nantigen-independent. Translocations such as t(11;18), t(14;18), or t(1;14) up-regulate the expression \nand function of BCL10 or MALT1 and promote the growth and survival of B cells. These translocations are relatively specific for extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas.",
