It is more \ncommon in the Asian population. It usually manifests in the 1st year of life. It causes acute \nepisodes of hemolysis when triggered by infections or oxidant drugs. The decreased  chain production leads to a relative excess of  chains. This leads to the \nformation of HbH which has a high affinity for oxygen.

      "explanation": "394 \nSold by @itachibot Among the given options, the heterozygous combination of HbS and HbC causes a more severe \nform of the disease. Overall severity is more in homozygous HbS. Severity sequence is HbSS &gt; HbSC &gt; HbSA &gt; HbSF. In HbC, lysine is substituted for glutamate in the sixth amino acid residue of  -globin. The \npercentage of HbS is 50% in HbSC red cells and 40% in HbAS cells. Moreover, HbSC cells tend to \nlose salt and water and become dehydrated, which increases the intracellular concentration of \nHbS. Both of these factors increase the tendency for HbS to polymerize. As a result, individuals \nwho are compound heterozygotes for HbS and HbC, have symptomatic sickling disorder (termed \nHbSC disease). However, it is milder than sickle cell disease (HbSS). HbF inhibits the polymerization of HbS even more than HbA. Hence, infants do not become \nsymptomatic until they reach 5 or 6 months of age when the level of HbF normally falls.",

This decreases the adherence of infected red cells to the endothelium. Individuals with sickle cell trait are significantly less likely to have severe disease or to die from \nmalaria.

      "explanation": "The concurrence of sickle cell anaemia and -thalassemia results in less severe hemolytic \nanaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is caused by point mutations in  globin synthesis leading to defective HbS \nsynthesis. When these RBCs release oxygen, the HbS polymerises leading to membrane distortion Thalassemia is due to germline mutations causing decreased globin chain synthesis ( or  ). Since \nthese diseases have a different pathogenesis, they can occur concurrently. In alpha-thalassemia, the concentration of hemoglobin is decreased. Therefore the concentration \nof HbS in sickle cell anaemia is also decreased. Since HbS molecules should be close to each other \nfor polymerization to occur. Since there is a decreased concentration of HbS in alpha-thalassemia, \nthe HbS molecules are far apart. So there is a decreased polymerization of HbS and therefore less \nseverity of the disease.",

The most commonly involved sites are the bones, lungs, liver, brain, \nspleen, and penis. Acute chest syndrome is a type of vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs. It \ntypically presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonary \ninflammation may cause blood flow to become sluggish and “spleenlike,” leading to sickling and \nvaso-occlusion. Sequestration crises occur in children with intact spleens.
