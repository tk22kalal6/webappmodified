      "explanation": "This clinical scenario and brain MRI showing a pituitary adenoma are suggestive of a lactotroph \nadenoma (prolactinoma). 1130 \nSold by @itachibot Pituitary adenomas are usually found in adults. The most common genetic alterations in this \ncondition are mutations in G proteins (particularly GNAS). Depending on their size, they are classified as: • Microadenomas - diameter &lt; 1 cm • Macroadenomas - diameter &gt; 1 cm They may be functioning or non-functioning. The most common type of functioning \npituitary adenomas are prolactinomas. The clinical features of prolactinoma include: • Due to mass effect - • Features of raised intracranial tension • Visual field disturbances (bitemporal hemianopia) - due to compression of optic chiasm • Hypopituitarism - due to compressed hypophyseal stalk • Due to hyperprolactinemia - • Galactorrhoea • Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea • Infertility • Loss of libido • Gynecomastia Serum prolactin concentrations tend to correlate with the size of the adenoma. The normal range \nof serum prolactin is 5-20 g/L. The diagnosis of prolactinoma is most likely to be associated with \na prolactin level &gt;200 g/L.",

They are associated with activating \nmutations of the HRAS oncogene. The diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma cannot be made based on histologic appearance alone. \nThough pituitary adenomas normally show cellular monomorphism and the absence of a reticulin \nnetwork, they can have some overlapping features with malignant tumors such as: • Atypical adenomas - show pleomorphism and atypical mitosis • Invasive adenomas - • Non-encapsulated 1131 \nSold by @itachibot • Show local invasion into cavernous and sphenoid sinuses, dura, brain • However, they remain confined to the primary tumor site",

      "explanation": "The most common cause of asymptomatic hypercalcemia (isolated hypercalcemia without signs or \nsymptoms) is primary hyperparathyroidism. It is also the most common cause of hypercalcemia \noverall. Primary hyperparathyroidism results in autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone \n(PTH), resulting in elevated levels. It usually results from an adenoma or hyperplasia of \nparathyroid tissue. The most common cause of symptomatic hypercalcemia is malignancy. The most common \nmechanism through which osteolytic tumors induce hypercalcemia is the secretion of the \nPTH-related peptide (PTHrP).",

Parathyroid tumors may be associated with cyclin D1 gene inversions and MEN1 \nmutations. Hyperparathyroidism refers to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). It is classified \ninto: • Primary - autonomous overproduction of PTH • Secondary - compensatory hypersecretion of PTH in response to prolonged hypocalcemia • Tertiary - persistent hypersecretion of PTH even after correction of prolonged hypocalcemia. \n(e.g. after renal transplant) 1133 \nSold by @itachibot The classical symptoms and signs of primary hyperparathyroidism are due to hypercalcemia as \nwell as increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

This condition is also called brown tumor or von Recklinghausen disease of bone. 1134 \nSold by @itachibot In hyperparathyroidism, high levels of PTH result in increased osteoclast activity. This results in \nbone loss which predisposes to microfractures and secondary hemorrhages. This results in the \nfollowing changes: • An influx of macrophages that form giant cells • Mass of reparative fibrous tissue • Increased vascularity, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin deposition - results in brown color The image given below is showing a brown tumor with numerous giant cells with interstitial \nhemorrhage, hemosiderin. Option A: Osteoporosis circumscripta is a large, well-defined lytic lesion seen in the skull of \npatients with Paget's disease.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia. As C-peptide is a \nmarker of endogenous insulin secretion, its levels would help in identifying the source of insulin: • High C-peptide - excess insulin production (insulinoma) • Normal/ low C-peptide - exogenous insulin administration (factitious disorder) The precursor molecule of insulin is pre-proinsulin, which gets cleaved to form proinsulin. This \nproinsulin gets cleaved to form insulin and C-peptide (by-product). Hence, both are secreted in \nequimolar quantities during insulin secretion. Hence, the level of C-peptide corresponds to the \nlevel of endogenous insulin. The levels of C-peptide decrease with the loss of  -cell mass in type 1 diabetes. 1135 \nSold by @itachibot",
