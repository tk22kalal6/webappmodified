Periductal mastitis is also called recurrent subareolar abscess or squamous metaplasia of \nlactiferous ducts or Zuska disease. In this condition, a relative deficiency of vitamin A associated \nwith smoking or toxic substances in tobacco smoke alters the differentiation of the ductal \nepithelium. Histologically, there is keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the nipple ducts. Keratin shed from \nthese cells is trapped and plugs (keratin plug) the ductal system, causing dilation and eventually \nrupture of the duct. This results in keratin spillage into the surrounding periductal tissue forming \na chronic granulomatous inflammatory response.

Hence the \nmyoepithelial cell markers like p63, basal cytokeratin (CK 5/6), calponin will be positive in DCIS \nwhereas it will be absent in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. However, myoepithelial markers may be \ndiminished in high-grade DCIS compared to surrounding normal ducts or lobules. Once the tumor cells penetrate through the basement membrane and grow within the stroma, \nthey are considered to be invasive carcinoma.

      "explanation": "Lobular carcinoma is the most common type of breast carcinoma to present as an occult primary \ncarcinoma. Lobular carcinoma of the breast is seen bilaterally and with multicentricity. Loss of E-cadherin is \nthe hallmark of lobular carcinoma. They also have characteristic patterns of metastatic spread, \noften involving the peritoneum and retroperitoneum, leptomeninges (carcinomatous meningitis), \ngastrointestinal tract, ovaries, and uterus. The histological hallmark of lobular carcinoma is the presence of discohesive infiltrating tumor \ncells, often arranged in a single Indian file pattern or in loose clusters or sheets. 1201 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "There is no or very slight desmoplastic response seen in lobular carcinomas. Desmoplasia refers to collagenous stromal proliferation induced by tumor cells which is essential \nfor tumor growth and spread. It results in hard and stony tumors. However, this is not seen in \nlobular carcinoma. This is likely due to the loss of expression of CDH1, the gene that \nencodes e-cadherin (normally maintains intercellular adhesiveness). This also results \nin disaggregation of cells. Lobular carcinomas are often bilateral and multicentric. It shows characteristic metastatic spread, \noften involving: • Peritoneum and retro peritoneum • Leptomeninges (carcinomatous meningitis) • Gastrointestinal tract • Ovaries • Uterus Histopathological image of invasive lobular carcinoma of breast showing discohesive cells with \nfew signet ring cells. 1202 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Individuals with heterozygous germline mutations in CDH1 (loss of E-cadherin) also have a \ngreatly increased risk of gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "T4d in the TNM staging of carcinoma breast points toward a diagnosis of inflammatory breast \ncarcinoma. It shows extensive invasion and proliferation of tumor cells within the dermal \nlymphatics leading to obstruction. Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. The hallmark of this \ncondition is the overexpression of e-cadherin. This results in increased tumor cohesion and the \nformation of tumoral clumps which can result in emboli. It has a particularly poor prognosis. 1203 \nSold by @itachibot These tumors are usually of high grade but do not belong to any particular molecular \nsubtype. More than half (60%) are ER-negative and 40% to 50% overexpress HER2. There is no \nassociation with trauma. Due to lymphatic obstruction, it results in brawny induration, erythema with a raised edge, and \nedema called peau d’orange appearance. This may mimic non-neoplastic inflammatory lesions \nlike mastitis. A breast lump may or may not be present. The following image shows a peau d’orange appearance of the right breast.",

This feature helps to differentiate it from intracanalicular fibroadenoma. The prognosis of phyllodes tumors depends on their histological grade. Most phyllodes tumors are \nlow grade, with limited stromal cellularity. They recur only occasionally and do not metastasize. The features of malignant (intermediate and high grade) phyllodes tumors are: • Markedly increased stromal cellularity • Stromal overgrowth - absence of epithelial elements 1208 \nSold by @itachibot • Nuclear atypia • Increased mitosis (&gt;10/ 10 hpf) • Highly recurrent Regardless of the grade, lymphatic spread is rare in phyllodes tumors.
