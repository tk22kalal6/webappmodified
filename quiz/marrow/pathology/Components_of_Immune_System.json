They are a group of clinical conditions characterised by recurrent inflammatory episodes. This \ndisorder is marked by abnormally increased inflammation, mediated predominantly by cells and \nmolecules of the innate immune system, with a significant host predisposition. NOD-like receptors are cytosolic receptors that signal via a cytosolic multiprotein complex called \nthe inflammasome. This activates caspase-1 that generates biologically active form of interleukin-1 \n(IL-1). IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation that recruits leukocytes and induces fever. The \nautoinflammatory syndromes respond very well to treatment with IL-1 antagonists. Note: Autoimmune diseases result from T and B-lymphocyte reactions against self-antigens.",

      "explanation": "Normal CD4+: CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio is 2:1. Approximately 60% of mature T cells are CD4+ \nand about 30% are CD8+. T-lymphocytes (thymus-derived cells) constitute 60–70% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. T-cell \nprogenitors are derived from the bone marrow, but travel to the thymus, where they mature.

      "explanation": "Dendritic cells or interdigitating dendritic cells are the most important antigen-presenting \ncells. They initiate T-cell responses against protein antigens. They are located in the epithelium and interstitium. They express many receptors for capturing \nand responding to microbes (and other antigens), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and lectins. \nThey also express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for presenting antigens \nto and activating T cells. In response to microbes, dendritic cells are recruited to the T-cell zones of lymphoid organs. Here, \nthey present antigens to T cells with help of MHC. Similar cells with dendritic morphology in the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles in the spleen \nand lymph nodes are follicular dendritic cells. They bear Fc receptors for IgG and receptors for \nC3b. Immature dendritic cells within the epidermis are called Langerhans cells.

They also participate in the effector phase of humoral immunity. Macrophages efficiently \nphagocytose and destroy microbes that are opsonized (coated) with IgG or C3b.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "IL-2 and IL-15 stimulate the proliferation of NK cells. On the other hand, IL-12 activates the \nkilling of target cells and secretion of IFN-. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes, which constitutes 5% to 10% of peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. CD16 and CD56 are the surface molecules. Functions of NK cells: • Killing of a variety of virus-infected cells and tumor cells, without prior exposure to or activation \nby these microbes or tumors • Secretion of interferon- (IFN-), which activates macrophages to destroy ingested microbes • Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) - NK cells express CD16 which is a \nreceptor for IgG Fc tails. Hence, these cells have the ability to lyse IgG-coated target cells. ADCC is also seen in immune responses involving neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, etc. The image given below shows activating and inhibitory receptors of natural killer (NK) cells. 268 \nSold by @itachibot Note: A new group of T cells has been discovered called NK-T cells.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Both cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells are effective against virus-infected cells. The NK cells have different mechanisms of action while killing target cells. NK cells can lyse IgG-coated target cells by binding to the Fc tail of IgG, through the CD16 \nreceptor expressed on NK cells. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cellular \ncytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cells secrete various cytokines such as interferon- (IFN-), which activate macrophages to \ndestroy ingested microbes. Target cell destruction by NK cells is also mediated through two others receptors - activating \nreceptors and inhibitory receptors. The activating receptors enable NK cells to recognize infected and stressed cells. The inhibitory \nreceptors recognize self class-I MHC molecules, that are expressed on all healthy cells thereby \npreventing NK cells from killing normal cells. Virus infection / neoplastic transformation \noverexpresses the activating receptors and simultaneously reduces the expression of class-I MHC \nmolecules. As a result, NK cells are activated and the infected cells are killed. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes directly kill damaged cells.

      "explanation": "CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) are the costimulatory molecules present on antigen-presenting cells \n(APCs). They bind to CD28 protein present on T cells. This promotes the expansion of \nantigen-stimulated T cells and their differentiation into effector and memory cells. T-cell activation requires two signals that are delivered by APCs. They include: • Antigens displayed by APCs in the form of peptides bound to MHC \nmolecules, that are recognised by T-cell receptors • Costimulatory signal (as it stimulates T cells in conjunction with antigen) provided by molecules \non APCs that engage particular costimulatory receptors on T cells In the absence of costimulation, T cells that recognize antigen either fail to respond and die or \nenter a state of unresponsiveness known as anergy.
