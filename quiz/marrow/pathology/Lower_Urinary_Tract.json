      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Hunner ulcers are chronic mucosal ulcers that are characteristic of interstitial cystitis or chronic \npelvic pain syndrome. 847 \nSold by @itachibot It is a rare idiopathic condition that occurs most frequently in women. It presents with \nintermittent severe suprapubic pain, urinary frequency, urgency, hematuria, and dysuria. The following cystoscopic findings are seen in the bladder mucosa: • Fissures • Punctate hemorrhages (glomerulations) The microscopic findings include: • Mucosal ulceration covered by fibrin and necrotic material • Increased numbers of mucosal mast cells • Submucosal edema In later stages, transmural fibrosis may occur, leading to a contracted bladder. Biopsy must be \ndone to rule out carcinoma in situ, which may clinically mimic interstitial cystitis. The following image shows a Hunner's ulcer in a patient with interstitial cystitis.",

Flexible cystoscopy revealed yellow-brown soft plaques with a \ncentral umbilication. Microscopy of the plaque showed Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. What is \nthe likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with the presence of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies is suggestive of \nmalakoplakia. Malakoplakia is a chronic inflammatory reaction resulting from acquired defects in phagocyte \nfunction, commonly affecting the urinary bladder. It can also be seen in other organ systems like \nthe gastrointestinal tract, female genital tract, and central nervous system. It is seen in chronic bacterial infection, mostly by Escherichia coli or occasionally Proteus \nspecies. Grossly, it presents as soft, yellow-brown, slightly raised mucosal plaques. Microscopically, the \nfollowing findings are seen: 848 \nSold by @itachibot • Large, foamy macrophages containing - • Abundant granular cytoplasm due to undigested bacterial products • Michaelis-Gutmann bodies - PAS-positive basophilic concretions due to iron and calcium \ndeposits in lysosomes • Occasional multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes Note: Xanthogranulomatous cystitis is morphologically and probably pathogenetically similar to \nmalakoplakia, but it lacks Michaelis–Gutmann bodies.",

      "explanation": "The most common cause of polypoid cystitis is indwelling catheters. Polypoid cystitis is an inflammatory lesion resulting from mucosal irritation. It may also be \nassociated with radiation therapy and malignant tumors. It usually involves the posterior wall of \nthe bladder. Grossly, it may show bulbous or papillary appearance and may be confused with papillary \nurothelial carcinoma. Microscopically, the papillary projections are broad-based, non-branching, \nand without atypia. Stroma is edematous with minimal inflammation. Options A and D: Adenovirus infection and the use of anti-cancer drugs like cyclophosphamide \ncause hemorrhagic cystitis. Option B: Systemic allergic disorders cause eosinophilic cystitis.",

      "explanation": "849 \nSold by @itachibot Malakoplakia is not a metaplastic lesion of the bladder. It is a type of chronic granulomatous \ncystitis due to defective phagocytic function that may mimic malignancy. Metaplastic lesions of the bladder include the following: • Nests of urothelium (Brunn nests) may grow downward into the lamina propria resulting in the \nfollowing lesions - • Cystitis glandularis - epithelial cells in the center of the nest undergo metaplasia and take on a \ncuboidal or columnar appearance • Cystitis cystica - epithelial cells retract to produce cystic spaces lined by flattened urothelium • Squamous metaplasia - in response to injury, urothelium is replaced by stratified squamous \nepithelium. • Nephrogenic adenoma - due to implantation of shed renal tubular cells at sites of injured \nurothelium, resulting in replacement of urothelium by cuboidal epithelium with a papillary \ngrowth pattern",

      "explanation": "The image shows oval-shaped eggs with the terminal spine which is characteristic of Schistosoma \nhaematobium. It is most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. The ova are deposited in the bladder wall and incite a brisk chronic inflammatory response. This \ninduces progressive mucosal squamous metaplasia and dysplasia and, in some instances, \nneoplasia. Schistosomal infection can less frequently result in adenocarcinoma or transitional cell \ncarcinoma.",
