      "explanation": "This clinical scenario of chronic cholecystitis and image showing lipid-laden xanthoma cells are \nsuggestive of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. This condition results due to the rupture of \nRokitansky–Aschoff sinuses. 972 \nSold by @itachibot Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses are bile-filled outpouchings of the gallbladder mucosa through the \ngallbladder wall. They develop in reaction to chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Eventually, \nthey may rupture into the wall of the gallbladder. This results in the accumulation of macrophages \nthat have ingested biliary phospholipids, which are called xanthoma cells. Chronic cholecystitis may have other sequelae: • Porcelain gallbladder - dystrophic calcification of the gallbladder wall • Hyalinizing cholecystitis - replacement of the gallbladder wall by dense fibrosis, with or without \ncalcification (leads to higher incidence of gallbladder carcinoma) • Hydrops of the gallbladder - atrophic, obstructed, dilated gallbladder containing clear fluid Acute cholecystitis includes the following variants: • Emphysematous cholecystitis - acute infection of the gallbladder by gas-forming organisms • Acalculous cholecystitis - due to gallbladder stasis and ischemia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas. The pancreas develops by fusion of the larger dorsal and smaller ventral pancreatic buds. The \ndorsal duct is the dominant duct during development and it drains into the minor papilla. The \nventral duct drains into the major papilla. After fusion, the following ducts are formed: • Main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) - formed by fusion of ducts of dorsal and ventral buds, drains \ninto the major papilla • Accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) - formed by the proximal portion of the dorsal duct, \ndrains into the minor papilla In pancreas divisum, the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse. Hence, the majority of the pancreas \ncontinues to drain through the dominant dorsal duct that enters the duodenum at the minor 973 \nSold by @itachibot papilla while the ventral duct, along with the bile duct, drains into the major papilla. These \npatients are more prone to pancreatitis. The other congenital anomalies of the pancreas are: • Annular pancreas - band-like ring of normal pancreatic tissue encircling 2nd part of duodenum, \nmay cause obstruction • Ectopic pancreas - common in stomach, duodenum, and jejunum (found in about 2% of \npostmortem exams) • Agenesis - rarely seen, associated with mutations of PDX1 (homeobox gene)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario in a young patient with positive family history of similar episodes is \nsuggestive of hereditary pancreatitis. Acute episodes of pancreatitis can be precipitated \nby hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. The following genes are implicated in hereditary pancreatitis: • Gain-of-function mutation in trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) - most common • Loss-of-function mutation in trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) • Loss of CFTR - abnormal secretions that promote protein plugging, duct obstruction, leading to \npancreatitis Hereditary pancreatitis is associated with a 40% lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer.",

The most frequently associated mutation with this condition is K-RAS. It is attributed to the production of platelet-aggregating factors and procoagulants from the tumor \nor its necrotic products. Both venous and arterial thrombi can occur. Venous thrombi can \nembolize to the lungs.

      "explanation": "Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas have dense stroma, similar to the ovarian stroma. These tumors have large cystic cavities filled with thick, tenacious mucin. They are lined by \ncolumnar, mucin-producing epithelium with dense stroma. This results in similarity to ovarian \nstroma. They usually arise in the tail of the pancreas and can be precursors to invasive carcinomas.
