      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario showing hemarthrosis and elevated aPTT is suggestive of hemophilia. Specific tests for measuring levels of factor VIII and factor IX can determine whether it is \nhemophilia A or hemophilia B respectively. Clinical features of hemophilia: • Hemarthroses - joint hemorrhages, later causing progressive deformities • Recurrent bleeding • Pseudotumour syndrome - fascial hemorrhages that occur as blood-filled cysts with calcification \nand proliferation of fibroblasts, giving the appearance of the tumor It is associated with elevated aPTT and normal platelet count, bleeding time, and PT. Option A: In ITP, the platelet count is low and bleeding time is prolonged. Option B: In functional platelet disorders, like Bernard Soulier syndrome, the platelet count is \nnormal and bleeding time is prolonged. Option D: In vitamin K deficiency, both PT and aPTT are prolonged. PT is relatively more \nprolonged than is the aPTT. 437 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Hemophilia A and B mostly affect males, but rarely can affect females also. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, affecting mainly males and homozygous \nfemales. Rarely, excessive bleeding occurs in heterozygous females. It is due to the inactivation of \nthe X chromosome bearing the normal factor VIII allele by chance in most cells \n(unfavourable lyonization). About 30% of patients have no family history and the disorder is \ncaused due to new mutations. Hemophilia B is inherited as X-linked recessive trait. There is a deficiency of factor IX. Hemophilia C is an autosomal-recessive condition and hence can occur in females. There is \na deficiency of factor XI.",

The differential diagnosis for normal platelet count with elevated PT, aPTT and TT are HIT \nand afibrinogenemia.

Unlike the clotting cascade in the lab (in vitro), the cascade in the body (in vivo) differs slightly - \nas tissue factor (TF) is the major initiator of the cascade. The TF/VIIa complex is the most \nimportant activator of factor IX and factor IXa/factor VIIIa complex is the most important \nactivator of factor X. Factor V is involved in both the pathways as shown in the image below. The coagulation cascade in the laboratory: • Extrinsic pathway sequence (in a test tube): Tissue factor  Factor VII  Factor X. • Intrinsic pathway sequence (in a test tube): Factor XII  Factor XI  Factor IX  Factor X Laboratory methods to initiate clotting include: • Intrinsic pathway - adding phospholipids, calcium, and either a negatively charged substance \nsuch as glass beads 440 \nSold by @itachibot • Extrinsic pathway - a source of tissue factor",

Causes of prolonged PT: • Administration of oral anticoagulant drugs - vitamin K antagonists • Liver disease - obstructive jaundice • Vitamin K deficiency • Disseminated intravascular coagulation • Previously undiagnosed factor VII, X, V or prothrombin deficiency or defect (rare) Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) measures the clotting time of plasma after the \nactivation of contact factors and the addition of phospholipid and CaCl2, but without added tissue \nthromboplastin.
