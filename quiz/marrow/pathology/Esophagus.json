A tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an abnormal fistula communication between the esophagus \nand trachea. The fistula is usually present near the tracheal bifurcation, with or without \nesophageal atresia. A blind proximal pouch with a distal tracheooesophageal fistula is the most \ncommon type of tracheoesophageal fistula (Type C). 10% of the patients have associated VACTERL anomalies (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal, \nesophageal, renal, and limb).",

      "explanation": "Achalasia cardia is characterized by decreased release of NO(nitric oxide) and VIP(vasoactive \nintestinal polypeptide) in the distal part of esophagus. Normally, NO and VIP are secreted by the inhibitory neurons of the Auerbach's plexus in the \ndistal esophagus. This leads to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). In achalasia \ncardia, these inhibitory neurons degenerate leading to decreased release of NO and VIP. This \ncauses increased LES tone. The triad of achalasia cardia is as follows: • Incomplete relaxation of LES • Increased tone of LES • Absent peristalsis (aperistalisis)",
