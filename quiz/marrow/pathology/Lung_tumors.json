Lung cancers: • The most common malignant tumors of the lung are metastases/ secondaries. • The most common primary malignant tumor of the lung is bronchogenic cancer. • The most common histology is adenocarcinoma (43.8%), followed by squamous cell (26.2%). 1117 \nSold by @itachibot",

P40 is the most sensitive and specific marker for \nsquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lungs. Other markers include cytokeratin 5/6 and P63. TTF-1 and napsin-A are the markers for adenocarcinoma. Chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 are the markers for small cell lung carcinoma. Note: The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Lung Tumors has made \na recommendation that at least one antibody each for squamous (P40 or P63) and glandular (e.g. \nTTF-1) differentiation should be used for an initial workup. Thus a simple panel of TTF-1 and p40 \nmay be able to classify most non-small cell carcinoma-not otherwise specified cases.",

It is an invasive malignant epithelial tumor with \nglandular differentiation. The tumor cells produce mucin. It is usually located peripherally (it \narises from the terminal bronchiole). Molecular genetics show frequent mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS, MET, and RET (Receptor \ntyrosine kinase genes) or KRAS mutations. Histologically, lepidic growth patterns are seen. It refers to the pattern of spread of the tumor in \nwhich the tumor cells “crawl” along normal-appearing alveolar septae and resembles butterflies \nresting on a fence. Adenocarcinomas grow in various patterns, including acinar, lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, \nand solid with mucin formation.

It can be used to distinguish primary \nadenocarcinoma of the lungs (TTF-1 positive) from other histological types of lung cancers, \nmetastatic adenocarcinoma, and mesothelioma (TTF-1 negative).

      "explanation": "Calretinin is most likely to be positive in this tumour as the given clinical scenario points to the \ndiagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare malignant tumour of the pleura, associated with heavy asbestos \nexposure (shipping factory). The lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma in heavily exposed \nindividuals is as high as 7% to 10%. It has strong male predilection (3:1). There is a long latent period of 25 to 45 years for the \ndevelopment of asbestos-related mesothelioma.

Microscopically, they are of three types: epithelioid (60%), sarcomatoid (20%), and mixed (20%). Electron microscopy in mesothelioma will show numerous long, slender microvilli and abundant \nmonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamellar bodies.

WHO divides neuroendocrine neoplasms into four categories: • Typical carcinoid • Atypical carcinoid • Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma • Small-cell carcinoma Carcinoid tumors are low-grade malignant epithelial neoplasms that represent 1% to 5% of all \nlung tumors. It is not related to smoking. Carcinoids may occur in patients with multiple \nendocrine neoplasia type 1. On gross examination, these tumors grow as fingerlike or spherical polypoid masses that project \ninto the lumen of the bronchus or as collar button lesions, penetrating the bronchial wall to fan \nout in the peribronchial tissue. Histologically, the tumor is composed of organoid, trabecular, palisading, ribbon, or rosette-like \narrangements of cells separated by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. On electron microscopy, the \ncells exhibit the dense-core neurosecretory granules. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for serotonin, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin, \ncalcitonin, or other peptides. 10% of the cases may produce carcinoid syndrome.

Most bronchial carcinoids follow a relatively benign course, do not have secretory activity and do \nnot metastasize to distant sites. Classic carcinoid syndrome is characterized by intermittent attacks of diarrhea, flushing, \nbronchospasm and cyanosis. Carcinoid syndrome is due to excessive production of serotonin, a specialised product of \ntryptophan metabolism by argentaffin cells (cells in the carcinoid tumor). It is then metabolised \nand excreted in urine. If urinary levels of 5- HIAA exceed 25 mg/day, a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome can be made.",
