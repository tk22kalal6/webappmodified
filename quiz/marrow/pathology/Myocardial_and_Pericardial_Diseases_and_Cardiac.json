Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with \nmechanical and/or electrical dysfunction. They usually exhibit inappropriate ventricular \nhypertrophy or dilatation. The causes are frequently genetic. Cardiomyopathies maybe primary predominantly involving the heart or secondary to a systemic \nor multiorgan disorder. They occur in the absence of any coronary artery disease, valvular heart \ndisease, congenital heart disease, or systemic arterial hypertension.

It is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also called broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, or \nstress-induced cardiomyopathy.

It is defined as left ventricular \nhypertrophy of &gt;15mm on ECHO. The left ventricular myocardium is poorly compliant. This \nleads to abnormal diastolic filling and intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction, i.e., primarily \ndiastolic dysfunction. The gross features of HCM are: • Massive myocardial hypertrophy usually without ventricular dilation • Asymmetric septal hypertrophy- disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative \nto the left ventricle free wall • Banana-shaped left ventricle- due to bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen The image given below shows changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to a normal \nheart.

Familial syndromes associated with myxomas have activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene or \nnull mutations in PRKAR1A. Mutations in GNAS1 is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. \nPRKAR1A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of a cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (Carney \ncomplex). Skin lesions are the most common manifestation of the Carney complex. The most common type \nof endocrine tumour in the Carney complex is the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical \ndisease (PPNAD). It is a form of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia that leads to adrenocorticotropic \nhormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome. NAME syndrome and LAMB syndrome are subsets of the Carney complex.

Allograft arteriopathy: It is the single most important long-term limitation for cardiac \ntransplantation.

      "explanation": "In the given scenario, a marathon runner will have cardiac hypertrophy with increased capillary \ndensity. Aerobic exercise, e.g., long-distance running, is associated with volume-load \nhypertrophy accompanied by an increase in capillary density. This is not seen in other forms of \nhypertrophy. This decreases resting heart rate and blood pressure. In hypertrophy due to pressure or volume overload, there is a sustained increase in mechanical \nwork. This cause myocytes to increase in size thus increasing the size and weight of the heart. The \nhypertrophied heart has an increased oxygen consumption but decreased supply. This is because \nhypertrophy is not accompanied by a proportional increase in capillary numbers. This leads to \nischemia-related decompensation, which can evolve to cardiac failure and eventually lead to \ndeath. The causes and consequences of hypertrophy are summarized in the below image. 740 \nSold by @itachibot Heart weight, rather than wall thickness, is the best measure of hypertrophy in dilated hearts. A patient with systemic hypertension has pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with an echo finding of an aortic valvular area of 0.6cm² is suggestive of aortic stenosis. \nThere is pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with a high pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex is suggestive of mitral \nregurgitation.
