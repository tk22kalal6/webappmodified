      "question": "Question 1: A 29-year-old African American man receives primaquine chemoprophylaxis before traveling \nfor a business trip. Four days later, he presents with jaundice and dark urine. Laboratory \ninvestigations show anemia, reticulocytosis, and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The \nperipheral blood smear shows the presence of Heinz bodies. What is the most likely mode of \ninheritance of the given clinical condition?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical history suggestive of hemolysis after the antimalarial (primaquine) and Heinz \nbodies on PBF, points to a diagnosis of G6PD deficiency (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase \ndeficiency). It is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. G6PD is an enzyme belonging to the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) pathway. Deficiency of \nenzymes of this pathway causes hemolysis as the protective ability of RBCs from oxidative stress is \nimpaired.

Episodic hemolysis (both intravascular and extravascular) is seen in G6PD deficiency. It is due to \nexposures that cause oxidative stress. The triggers include: • Infections - oxygen-derived free radicals produced by activated leukocytes • Drugs • Antimalarials - primaquine and chloroquine • Sulfonamides • Nitrofurantoin • Diet - fava bean",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given peripheral smear shows Heinz bodies which are dark stained inclusion bodies in red \ncells. They can cause intravascular as well as extravascular hemolysis. In G6PD-deficiency, the RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants. This causes cross-linking of \nreactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains. The globin chains become denatured and form \nmembrane-bound precipitates known as Heinz bodies. These can be detected by supravital \nstaining. Heinz bodies can damage the membrane sufficiently to cause intravascular hemolysis. 403 \nSold by @itachibot As RBCs with Heinz bodies pass through the spleen, the macrophages pluck out the Heinz bodies. \nAs a result, some of these partially devoured cells retain an abnormal shape i.e. as if a bite was \ntaken out of them. Such cells are called bite cells. Bite cells are trapped in splenic cords and \nremoved by phagocytes leading to extravascular hemolysis. The images given below show Heinz bodies and bite cells seen in G6PD deficiency. 404 \nSold by @itachibot",

This condition is protective against Plasmodium 405 \nSold by @itachibot falciparum malaria. Malarial parasites preferentially invade RBCs which are rich in G6PD. G6PD deficiency causes \noxidative stress and hemolysis, preferably in the older RBCs. Reticulocytes and young \nerythrocytes have much higher G6PD activities and are less susceptible to oxidant damage. P. falciparum can invade erythrocytes of all ages. P. vivax, and P. ovale invade reticulocytes \n(immature erythrocytes) preferentially. Hence, a low G6PD level in older RBC is protective against \nP. falciparum malaria. Episodic hemolysis in this condition can be triggered by fava beans which is a staple in Egyptian \ncuisine. The images given below show Heinz bodies and bite cells seen in G6PD deficiency.",

      "explanation": "406 \nSold by @itachibot Hemolysis in G6PD-deficiency anemia does not continue for the entire period that the patient \ntakes the offending drug. It stops after a few days. Two variants of G6PD, designated as G6PD– and G6PD Mediterranean, cause most of the \nclinically significant hemolytic anemias. The half-life of G6PD- is moderately reduced, whereas \nthat of G6PD Mediterranean is markedly reduced; hence, the severity of deficiency is greater with \nthe Mediterranean variant. The most common normal variant is G6PD B. The hemolysis in G6PD deficiency is both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. The \ndamaged red cells are sequestered in the spleen and killed \nby macrophages, causing extravascular hemolysis. The oxidative stresses can denature \nhemoglobin, resulting in intravascular hemolysis. In individuals with G6PD deficiency, acute intravascular hemolysis begins 2 to 3 days after \nexposure to oxidants. Only older RBCs are at risk for lysis. The hemolytic episode is \nself-limited because hemolysis stops when only younger G6PD-replete red cells remain, even if the \npatient continues to take the offending drug.",

      "explanation": "The type of hemolysis seen in the different immunohemolytic anemia are: Autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHA) cause both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. In warm antibody type, hemolysis is extravascular. IgG-coated red cells are phagocytosed and \ndestroyed in the spleen. In cold agglutinin type, hemolysis is extravascular and intravascular. In the peripheral vascular \nbed (low temperature), IgM binds to the red cells. This causes agglutination and \ncomplement-fixing. They are unbound when they reach the general circulation. However, the IgM \ninteraction causes deposition of sublytic quantities of C3b. It is an excellent opsonin, which leads \nto the removal of RBCs by phagocytes in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Cold hemolysin type is a rare subtype of AIHA. Hemolysis is intravascular. IgG binds to the P \nblood group antigen on the red cells, which leads to complement-mediated lysis. 407 \nSold by @itachibot Type \nHemolysis Extravascular Warm antibo \ndy Cold agglutini \nn Extravascular and intravascul \nar Cold hemolys \nin Intravascular",

Two different mechanisms for drug-induced immune hemolytic anemias are: Antigenic drugs: • Anemia occurs 1-2 weeks after initiation of large IV dose of the offending drug • These drugs bind to red cell membrane and are recognised by anti-drug antibodies • They can cause both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis • E.g. penicillin, cephalosporins, quinidine Tolerance-breaking drugs: • Antibodies are produced against red cell antigens, particularly Rh antigens • E.g. alpha-methyl dopa",
