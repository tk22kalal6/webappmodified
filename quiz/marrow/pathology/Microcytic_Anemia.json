      "explanation": "Anaemia is the most common hematologic abnormality associated with HIV infection. It affects 60–\n80% of patients during the late stage. In most cases, the cause of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is multifactorial. It is often \nassociated with infection, inflammation, malignancy, malnutrition, and polypharmacy. 332 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Prior to the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), thrombocytopenia was a common \nfinding in individuals infected with HIV. With use of potent ART, the incidence of \nthrombocytopenia is far lower.",

Ceruloplasmin and hephaestin help in oxidation of \nFe2+ to Fe3+ at the basolateral border of enterocytes. This is coupled with transport through \nferroportin. In plasma, iron is transported by transferrin. Haptocorrin and cubulin are involved in vitamin B12 absorption. Selenoprotein is involved in \nselenium metabolism. 334 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Hepcidin inhibits iron transfer from the enterocytes into the plasma by binding to ferroportin, \nwhich is an iron efflux channel in the enterocyte. Iron metabolism is regulated by hepcidin, a protein and acute phase reactant produced by the \nliver. It binds to ferroportin and degrades it. This inhibits the transfer of iron from the enterocyte \nto the plasma via ferroportin. As a result, iron becomes trapped within the duodenal cells \n(enterocytes) in the form of mucosal ferritin and is lost in feces when these cells are shed off. Transcription of hepcidin is increased by the following factors: • Increased levels of iron • Inflammatory cytokines Transcription of hepcidin is decreased by the following factors: • Iron deficiency • Hypoxia • Ineffective erythropoiesis Hepcidin is encoded by the HAMP gene and its mutations are associated with hereditary \nhemochromatosis. 335 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Ferritin mRNA concentration iron responsive element decreases and ferritin synthesis "
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In iron deficiency anaemia, there is an increase in transferrin receptor mRNA concentration and \nsynthesis. Iron absorbed through diet or which is released from circulation is bound to transferrin (iron \ntransfer protein). When erythropoiesis is stimulated, iron-transferrin complexes act as transferrin \nreceptors on the surface of bone marrow erythroid cells. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis, \nthis complex is internalised. This iron is then made available for heme synthesis while the transferrin-receptor complex is \nrecycled to the surface of the cell, from where the transferrin is released back into circulation and \nthe transferrin receptor re-anchors into the cell membrane. The excess iron after hemoglobin \nsynthesis binds to apoferritin (storage protein), forming ferritin. Senescent RBCs undergo phagocytosis in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The \nhemoglobin is broken down, the globin and other proteins are returned to the amino acid pool, \nand the iron is shuttled back to the surface of the reticuloendothelial cell, where it is taken up by \ntransferrin via ferroportin (iron export channel). There is no regulated excretory pathway for iron, and the only mechanisms by which iron is lost \nare blood loss (via gastrointestinal bleeding, menstruation, or other forms of bleeding) and the \nloss of epithelial cells from the skin, gut, and genitourinary tract. The normal daily iron loss from \nthe body is 1-2 mg. 336 \nSold by @itachibot Variables \nIron-deficient state \nIron-excess stat \ne Iron uptake \n\n \n Transferrin receptor synthesi \ns \n Transferrin receptor mRNA c \noncentration Iron storage \n\n Ferritin synthesis \n\n Ferritin mRNA concentration \nNo change \nNo change",
