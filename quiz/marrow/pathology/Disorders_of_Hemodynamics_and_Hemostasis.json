      "explanation": "The finding seen in the given image is pitting edema. Edema can be caused by elevated \nhydrostatic pressure and reduced colloid osmotic pressure. Under normal circumstances, there is little net movement of fluid out of vessels due to the balance \nof: • Vascular hydrostatic pressure which has the tendency to push water and salts out of capillaries \ninto the interstitial space • Plasma osmotic pressure or colloid oncotic pressure which has a tendency to pull water and salts \nback into vessels. The pressure dynamics seen inside a capillary is given below. Atarterial end \nAtvenous end Capillary hydrostatic pressur \ne = 15-20 mmHg Capillary hydrostatic pressur \ne = 30-35 mmHg Osmotic Pressure = 25 mmH \ng Osmotic Pressure = 25 mmH \ng Hydrostatic Pressure < Osmo \ntic Pressure Fluid moves in \nto the capillary Hydrostatic Pressure > Osmo \ntic Pressure Fluid moves o \nutof the capillary 128 \nSold by @itachibot Many pathologic disorders are associated with an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure or a \ndecrease in plasma osmotic pressure, which lead to edema.",

However, there \nmay be certain exceptions like chylous peritoneal effusions which may be milky due to the \npresence of lipids absorbed from the gut. 130 \nSold by @itachibot Exudative effusions are protein-rich and often cloudy due to the presence of WBCs. Subcutaneous edema has the following features: • Dependent edema - dependent areas (towards gravity) have high hydrostatic pressures i.e., in \nthe legs when standing and the sacrum when recumbent • Pitting edema - finger pressure over markedly edematous subcutaneous tissue displaces the \ninterstitial fluid and leaves a depression. Edema resulting from renal dysfunction often appears initially in parts of the body containing \nloose connective tissue, such as the eyelids. Thus, periorbital edema is a characteristic finding in \nsevere renal disease.",

These cytokines cause a cascade of \nevents culminating in increased capillary permeability and redistribution of circulatory volume \ninto the interstitium.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The first step of hemostasis is arteriolar vasoconstriction. The normal process of hemostasis is as follows: • Arteriolar vasoconstriction - After vascular injury, local neurohumoral factors induce transient \nvasoconstriction. • Primary hemostasis - The various steps involved in this process are: • Platelets bind via glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) receptors to von Willebrand factor (vWF) on exposed \nextracellular matrix (ECM) • Activation of platelets which undergo a change in shape and release their granules • Released adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) induce additional platelet \naggregation through platelet GpIIb-IIIa receptor binding to fibrinogen • Formation of the primary platelet plug • Secondary hemostasis - Local activation of the coagulation cascade involving tissue factor and \nplatelet phospholipids results in fibrin polymerization, cementing the platelets into a definitive \nsecondary hemostatic plug. • Clot stabilization and resorption - Counter-regulatory mechanisms, mediated by tissue \nplasminogen activator (tPA, a fibrinolytic product) and thrombomodulin, confine the hemostatic \nprocess to the site of injury.",

      "explanation": "Thrombomodulin is an anticoagulant. 134 \nSold by @itachibot It is produced by all endothelial cells except those in cerebral microcirculation.

      "question": "Question 21: A bridge construction worker presents with generalized bone pain. He is found to have \nischemic necrosis of bilateral femoral heads, left tibia, and right humerus. Caisson disease is \nsuspected. What is this condition related to?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Change in pressure",
        "b": "Change in viscosity",
        "c": "Change in blood flow",
        "d": "Change in coagulability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Caisson disease is a chronic form of decompression sickness which occurs when individuals \nexperience a sudden decrease in atmospheric pressure. It is named after the pressurized vessels that are used in bridge construction as workers in these \nvessels are known to suffer from both acute and chronic forms of decompression sickness. When air is breathed at high pressure, increased amounts of gas, particularly nitrogen, are \ndissolved in the blood and tissues. If there is a sudden fall in pressure, the nitrogen comes out of \nthe solution in the tissues and the blood and forms gas emboli. In Caisson disease, the persistence \nof gas emboli in the skeletal system leads to the development of multiple foci of ischemic necrosis. \nThe more common sites are the femoral heads, tibia, and humeri.",

      "question": "Question 22: Chest X-ray of a 60-year-old woman with dyspnoea at rest revealed right-sided pleural \neffusion. A pleural fluid analysis was done. Which of the following findings would rule out a \ntransudative cause?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Pleiotropism",
        "b": "Variable expressivity",
        "c": "Polymorphism",
        "d": "3, 4 and 5 only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "High plasma protein content in the pleural fluid would rule out a transudative cause. In a \ntransudative effusion, the fluid has low protein content, little or no cellular material, and low \nspecific gravity. It is essentially an ultrafiltrate of the blood plasma. It is produced as a result of osmotic or \nhydrostatic imbalance across the vessel wall. There is no increase in vascular permeability.
