      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Standard karyotyping refers to an arrangement of chromosomes from a cell that is undergoing \nmitosis at metaphase. At other mitotic stages, the chromosomes are not sufficiently condensed or are too dispersed to \nallow for the counting and comparison of pairs under the microscope. In a metaphase spread, the \nindividual chromosomes take the form of two chromatids connected to the centromere. A variety of staining methods are available to identify the individual chromosomes on the basis of \na distinctive and reliable pattern of alternating light and dark bands. The most common method \nused involves a Giemsa stain and is hence called G-banding. Standard G-banding can detect \napproximately 400 to 800 bands per haploid set.

      "explanation": "The short arm of a chromosome (marked as 1) is designated p (for petite), and the long arm \n(marked as 2) is referred to as q (the next alphabet). In a banded karyotype, each arm of the chromosome is divided into two or more regions bordered \nby prominent bands. The regions are numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3) from the centromere outward. Each \nregion is further subdivided into bands and sub-bands, and these are ordered numerically as well.",

      "explanation": "A ring chromosome is an aberrant chromosome whose broken ends fuse together to form a ring. Ring chromosomes behave abnormally in meiosis or mitosis and usually result in serious \nconsequences. In rare cases, the telomeres at the ends of a chromosome fuse without any loss of 186 \nSold by @itachibot genetic material, which results in a normal phenotype. A ring chromosome is denoted by the \nsymbol r in human genetics. The following image shows a representative karyotype from a well-differentiated transitional cell \ncarcinoma of the bladder. The chromosome indicated by 'r' represents a ring chromosome. Also \nevident are monosomy 9, 18, and X and trisomy 7. Option A: In a translocation, a segment of one chromosome is transferred to another. Option C: Inversion refers to a rearrangement that involves two breaks within a single \nchromosome, with reincorporation of the inverted, intervening segment. Option D: Isochromosome formation results when one arm of a chromosome is lost and the \nremaining arm is duplicated.

      "explanation": "Inversion involves only a rearrangement of the genetic material. There is no change in the genetic \nmaterial. It occurs as a result of two breaks within a single chromosome. The intervening segment between \nthe breaks gets inverted and reincorporated. It is of two types: • Paracentric - inversion involving only one arm of the chromosome • Pericentric - inversion involving opposite sides of the centromere Inversions are often fully compatible with normal development. Transversions are mutations where a purine base pair is replaced by a pyrimidine or vice versa.",

In diseases following the mitochondrial pattern of inheritance, all children of an affected mother \nand normal father develop the disease. However, children born to an affected father and a normal \nmother do not inherit the disease. Hence, only the daughters of the affected mother will transmit \nthe disease. This is because this condition is due to a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is \nderived from the maternal mitochondria.

      "explanation": "In Turner's syndrome, webbing of the neck is associated with a higher risk of cardiac anomalies. The image below summarises the clinical features of Turner's syndrome. 196 \nSold by @itachibot The image given below shows the webbing of neck. Noonan syndrome is characterised by mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. The most common \nof these is the PTPN11 which encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase on chromosome 12. Clinical features include: • Short stature • Short webbed neck • Cystic hygroma • Tall forehead • Low posterior hairline • Dental malocclusion 197 \nSold by @itachibot Although it shares many clinical features with Turner’s syndrome, Noonan syndrome \naffects both sexes. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern and it also has a different pattern \nof congenital heart disease, typically involving right-sided lesions.",
