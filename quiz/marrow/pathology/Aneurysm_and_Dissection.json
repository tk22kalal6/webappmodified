      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pulsating hematoma is associated with a false aneurysm. An aneurysm is a localized abnormal dilation of a blood vessel or the heart. There are 2 types: • True aneurysm • Due to weakened and thinned, but intact arterial wall • False aneurysm • Due to a defect in the vascular wall • Results in an extravascular hematoma that communicates with intravascular space • Causes transmission of arterial pulsations to the hematoma (pulsating hematoma) Dissection occurs when blood enters a defect in the arterial wall and tunnels/dissects between its \nlayers. The image below shows a pseudo/false aneurysm of the left ventricle. False aneurysm \nDissection Defect across all the layers of Defect is usually an intimal t \near the vessel wall Hematoma is extravascular ( \noutside the vessel wall) Hematoma is within the laye \nrs of the vessel wall Hematoma is lined by extrav \nascular connective tissue Hematoma is lined by the lay \ners of the vessel wall 649 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in a hypertensive \npatient. It may occur due to the rupture of Berry aneurysms, which are saccular aneurysms. Aneurysms are classified as: • Saccular aneurysms are spherical outpouchings involving only a portion of the vessel wall. • Fusiform aneurysms are diffuse, circumferential dilations involving long vascular segments. • Both saccular and fusiform aneurysms are true aneurysms because they have an intact vessel \nwall. • Dissecting aneurysm is produced when a dissection leads to an aneurysm. The image below shows the CT appearance of a SAH. 650 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The likely underlying pathophysiology causing this condition is increased metalloproteinase \nexpression that degrades extracellular matrix and weakens the vessel wall. The two most important causes of aortic aneurysms are atherosclerosis and hypertension. \nAneurysms occuring as a consequence of atherosclerosis occurs most commonly in the abdominal \naorta and common iliac arteries. Option A: Obliterative end-arteritis of vasa-vasorum occurs in late stage syphilis and can \ncontribute to aneurysms Option D: Medial hypertrophy of vasa-vasorum occurs in hypertension, which is associated most \ncommonly with ascending aortic aneurysms.",

Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and its complications, including abdominal aortic \naneurysms (AAA). AAA can also be associated with smaller aneurysms of the iliac \narteries.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with the CT finding of a second column of blood after an intimal tear is \nthe classic presentation of an aortic dissection. The major risk factor for aortic dissection is \nhypertension. Dissection occurs when blood enters into the media to form a blood-filled channel between the \nlaminar planes of the media. It usually occurs due to a tear in the intima which allows blood in the \nlumen to flow into the media. It may also occur due to the rupture of vasa vasorum. It occurs due to: • Hypertension • Connective tissue defects like Marfan syndrome • Iatrogenic trauma during coronary catheterization or cardiopulmonary bypass 653 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The above image shows a double-barreled aorta with a superior and inferior lumen. It is a less \nsevere type of dissection because it is less likely to cause hemorrhage. A double-barreled aorta is seen there are two intimal tears. Hence, the hematoma enters the \nmedia through an intimal tear but re-enters back into the lumen through another intimal tear \npresent distally. As the blood enters the lumen back, this type of dissection does not progress, \nthus averting hemorrhage. This creates a false vascular channel in the blood vessel which, over time, can be endothelialized \nto become chronic dissections. 654 \nSold by @itachibot",
