      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with polyarthritis (1 major) along with fever and ESR elevated (2 \nminor) is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever. It is an example of type II hypersensitivity. This condition classically occurs a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis \nor, less commonly, skin infections. The antibodies to streptococcal cell-wall antigen cross-react \nwith myocardial antigen resulting in macrophage activation and inflammation. Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to \nchronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. Damage to \nheart tissue may be caused by a combination of antibody and T-cell-mediated reactions. 758 \nSold by @itachibot",

They contain fibrin, inflammatory cells, bacteria, or other organisms. The \nmitral valve is most commonly involved. Complications of infective endocarditis: • Cardiac complications - valvular insufficiency or stenosis, myocardial ring abscess, suppurative \npericarditis • Embolic complications - left-sided (brain, spleen, kidney) or right-sided lesion (lung infarct and \nabscess) • Renal complications - embolic infarcts, focal (more common) or diffuse glomerulonephritis (less \ncommon)",

      "explanation": "The rightly matched vegetations with the conditions that they are seen are as follows: 1-C, 2-A, \n3-D, 4-B Rheumatic heart disease often presents with rheumatic fever phase where small, warty 1- 2 mm \nvegetations, also called veruccae, extend along the lines of closure of the valve leaflets. The \ncardinal anatomical changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are: • Leaflet thickening • Commissural fusion and shortening • Thickening and fusion of the tendinous chords Infective endocarditis has large, irregular, friable masses on the valve cusps that can extend onto \nthe chordae. These vegetations can be single or multiple and may involve one or more \nvalves. They are potentially destructive lesions and contain fibrin, inflammatory cells, bacteria or \nother organisms. They can erode into the underlying myocardium and produce a ring abscess. \nThey are prone to embolisations, resulting in abscess formation wherever they lodge due to the \npresence of virulent organisms. Thus, it may lead to sequelae like septic infarcts or mycotic \naneurysms. Subacute infective endocarditis contains less destructive vegetations. They contain granulation \ntissue at their bases indicative of healing. Fibrosis, calcification and a chronic inflammatory \ninfiltrate can develop over the time. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterised by one or more small, 1-5 mm, sterile \nvegetations which are usually attached at the line of closure. They are seen associated with \nhypercoagulable states like chronic DIC or malignancy. They are loosely attached to the \nunderlying valve and are non-destructive in nature. They do not cause any inflammatory reaction \nbut they can be a source of systemic embolisation. Libman-Sack's endocarditis has small- or medium-sized, 1- 4 mm, sterile vegetations associated \nwith systemic lupus erythematosus. They may be present on one or both the sides of the leaflets, \non the valve surface, chordae or anywhere on the endocardium. These vegetations develop due to \nimmune complex deposition and complement activation. They cause intense valvulitis resulting in \nfibrinoid necrosis of the valve substance. Persistent injury to the valves can result in scarring and \nleaflet fusion.",
