      "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the images showing amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are \ndiagnostic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), complicated by cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The \nformation and aggregation of A peptides are responsible for AD. 1310 \nSold by @itachibot Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is neurotrophic and neuroprotective. It is present in astrocytes \nand neuroglia. This protein is cleaved at 3 sites by secretase enzymes (,  , and ), and the \nproducts are known as A peptides. In Alzheimer's disease, A peptides get aggregated in the form of amyloid plaques, which stain \npositive for Congo red. These get deposited within the neural tissue (A 42) and the cerebral \narterioles (A 40 protein, causing CAA), which causes neuronal dysfunction, and is the first sign of \nAD. Normally, tau proteins within the neurons stabilize microtubules, however, in AD, these get \nhyperphosphorylated and lose their function. Hyperphosphorylated tau proteins combine with \ncytoplasmic fibrils, to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and get abnormally accumulated \naround the neuronal nucleus.",

It is a degenerative disease of the caudate \nand putamen (striate neurons) caused by trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene \non chromosome 4. The severity of the disease depends on the number of repeats. With more \nrepeats, the disease becomes more severe. The disease also manifests at an earlier age, a \nphenomenon called anticipation. The caudate nucleus is dramatically atrophied, with accompanying atrophy of the putamen, \ncortex, and hydrocephalus ex vacuo of the 3rd ventricle. The medium-sized GABAergic neurons \nare especially affected. It causes chorea and dementia. Motor problems like chorea typically precede dementia.",
