      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation and biopsy findings point to a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. \nNeoplastic cells in Burkitt's lymphoma are usually BCL2 negative. The biopsy image shows the classical finding of Burkitt's lymphoma called the starry sky \nappearance. Tumour cells show multiple small nucleoli, minimal cytoplasm and a high mitotic index. They are \nclosely apposed to each other forming a dark blue background (sky). The macrophages get stuffed in between along with cellular debris. They are called tingible body \nmacrophages. Upon fixation, the cytoplasm of these phagocytes washes away leaving behind white \nspaces filled with debris (the stars). Burkitt lymphoma is the most common NHL in children &lt;15 years. Three distinct clinical forms of Burkitt's lymphoma are: • Endemic- affects children in Africa, affects jaw, maxilla, and is EBV-associated. • Sporadic- in adults in western countries. • Immunodeficiency associated- is associated with HIV infection. 542 \nSold by @itachibot It is the most rapidly proliferating human tumor, Ki-67 stains for 100% of cells (DLBCL- 40% \nstaining with Ki-67). Histology shows the characteristic starry sky pattern. Immunophenotypic markers include: • Surface IgM type and immunoglobulin light chains (kappa &gt; lambda) • B cell-associated antigens -CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a • Germinal centre-associated markers- CD10 &amp; BCL-6 • HLA-DR and CD43 • Expression of CD21 -the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)/C3d receptor, is dependent on the EBV status \nof the tumors • Endemic BL: EBV (+), express CD21 • Non-endemic BL: EBV (--) and lack CD21 expression Treatment must begin within 48h of diagnosis in both children and adults with an intensive \ncombination of chemotherapy regimens with high doses of cyclophosphamide and CNS \nprophylaxis.",

In addition to the MYC translocations in Burkitt lymphoma and a subset of other B and T cell \ntumours, MYC is amplified in some breast, colon, lung, and many other carcinomas.

Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, in contrast, presents as a mass involving the mandible. It shows an \nunusual predilection for the involvement of abdominal viscera, particularly kidneys, ovaries and \nadrenal glands.
