Based on the regenerative capacity of cells, tissues are classified into 3 types: • Labile tissues • Stable tissues • Permanent tissues Labile cells refer to continuously proliferating cells that are lost and replaced by the maturation \nof stem cells and the proliferation of these mature cells. Tissues containing these cells can readily \nregenerate after an injury as long as the pool of stem cells is preserved. Some examples of labile cells include: • Hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow • Majority of surface epithelia - • Stratified squamous epithelia of the skin, oral cavity, vagina, and cervix • Cuboidal epithelia of the ducts draining exocrine organs (salivary glands, biliary tract) • Columnar epithelium of the GIT, uterus, and fallopian tubes • Transitional epithelium of the urinary tract",

Based on the regenerative capacity of cells, tissues are classified into 3 types: • Labile tissues • Stable tissues • Permanent tissues Stable cells are quiescent (in the G0 stage of the cell cycle) and have only minimal proliferative \nactivity in their normal state. However, they can divide in response to injury or loss of tissue \nmass.

Based on the regenerative capacity of cells, tissues are classified into 3 types: • Labile tissues • Stable tissues • Permanent tissues Permanent cells are those which are considered to be terminally differentiated and \nnon-proliferative in postnatal life.

      "explanation": "TGF- (transforming growth factor- ) decreases the degradation of the extracellular matrix by \ninhibiting metalloproteinases. It is produced by most cells in granulation tissue, including alternatively activated macrophages. The functions of TGF- include: • Stimulates fibroblast migration and proliferation • Increases synthesis of collagen and fibronectin (connective tissue proteins) • Decreased degradation of ECM by inhibiting metalloproteinases • Involved in scar formation after injury • Development of fibrosis in lung, liver, and kidneys following chronic inflammation • Anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation and activity 116 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Glucocorticoid excess results in delayed healing, not glucocorticoid deficiency. Various factors affect wound healing including mechanical factors (pressure and torsion and site \nof injury) and location and extent of the injury. Vitamin C helps in the activation of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases which help in the hydroxylation \nof procollagen. As inadequately hydroxylated procollagen is vulnerable to enzymatic degradation, \nvitamin C plays an essential role in wound healing.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a clean surgical incision that is sutured is an example of healing \nby primary intention. In this type of healing, neovascularization reaches its peak by day 5, as \ngranulation tissue fills the incisional space. These new vessels are leaky, allowing the passage of plasma proteins and fluid into the \nextravascular space. Hence, new granulation tissue is often edematous.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is an example of wound healing by secondary intention. The initial provisional \nmatrix in this type of healing is composed of type III collagen, fibrin, and plasma fibronectin. It is later replaced by a matrix composed primarily of type I collagen. This type of healing occurs when cell or tissue loss is more extensive, such as in large wounds, \nabscesses, ulceration, and ischemic necrosis in parenchymal organs. The repair process involves a \ncombination of regeneration and scarring. 118 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Accumulation of excessive amounts of collagen during repair leads to the formation of \nhypertrophic scar. When this scar tissue grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound, it is \nknown as a keloid. Collagen plays a role in the normal adherence of tissue edges at the site of injury. Contraction in \nthe size of a wound is an important part of the normal healing process. An exaggeration of this \nprocess gives rise to contractures. They are particularly prone to develop on the palms, soles, \nanterior thorax and are commonly seen after serious burns. Inadequate formation of granulation tissue or formation of a scar leads to wound dehiscence and \nulceration. The following image shows a hypertrophic scar.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The history of a shaving cut and the image showing a large area of scar tissue are suggestive of a \nkeloid. A keloid refers to excess accumulation of collagen at the scar site with growth of the scar \ntissue beyond the boundaries of the original wound. It does not regress. Option A: Exuberant granulation or proud flesh refers to the protrusion of excessive amounts of \ngranulation tissue above the level of the surrounding skin. This blocks re-epithelialization. Option B: The accumulation of excessive amounts of collagen may give rise to a raised scar known \nas a hypertrophic scar. However, it remains within the boundaries of the original scar. Option D: Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, vascular tumor. 119 \nSold by @itachibot",
