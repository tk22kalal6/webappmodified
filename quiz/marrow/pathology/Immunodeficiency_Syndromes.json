      "explanation": "Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency (LAD) type 2 is due to the absence of Sialyl-Lewis X. Physiologically Sialyl-Lewis X has the necessary ligand for the selectins which bind to leukocytes. Inherited defects in leukocyte adhesion: • Type 1 - defect in the biosynthesis of the  2 chain shared by the LFA-1 and Mac-1 integrins • Type 2 - absence of sialyl-Lewis X, the fucose containing ligand for E- and P-selectins. It is due to \na defect in the fucosyltransferase, the enzyme that attaches fucose moieties to protein backbones. The major clinical problem in both conditions is recurrent bacterial infections due to inadequate \ngranulocyte function.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The biopsy \nof the thymus showing remnants of Hassall's corpuscles indicates it is due to adenosine \ndeaminase (ADA) deficiency. SCID is a defect in both humoral and cell-mediated immune \nresponses. Usually the defect lies in the T-cell compartment with secondary impairment in \nhumoral immunity. Affected infants present with prominent thrush (oral candidiasis), extensive diaper rash, and \nfailure to thrive. Some patients develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth because maternal T \ncells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing graft-versus-host disease \n(GVHD). Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of \npathogens, including: • Candida albicans • Pneumocystis jiroveci • Pseudomonas • Cytomegalovirus • Varicella There are 2 types of SCID based on inheritance: 1. X-linked SCID is the most common form and hence it is more common in boys than in girls. \nThe genetic defect is the mutation in the common -chain (c) subunit of cytokine receptors. T-cell \nnumbers are greatly reduced, and although B cells may be normal in number, antibody synthesis \nis impaired because of the lack of T-cell help. The thymus contains lobules of undifferentiated \nepithelial cells resembling fetal thymus. 300 \nSold by @itachibot 2. Autosomal recessive is most commonly caused due to deficiency of the enzyme adenosine \ndeaminase (ADA). The deficiency of ADA leads to the accumulation of deoxyadenosine and its \nderivatives (e.g., deoxy-ATP). They are toxic to rapidly dividing immature lymphocytes, especially \nthose of the T-cell lineage. Hence, there may be a greater reduction in the number of T \nlymphocytes. In the two most common forms (c mutation and ADA deficiency), the thymus is small and devoid \nof lymphoid cells. In SCID caused by ADA deficiency, remnants of Hassall’s corpuscles can be \nfound. Note: X-linked SCID is the first human disease in which gene therapy has been successful.",

The classic form of this disease has the following characteristics: • B cells are absent or markedly decreased and the serum levels of all classes of immunoglobulins \nare decreased • T-cell mediated reactions are normal • Germinal centers of lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches, the appendix, and tonsils are underdeveloped 301 \nSold by @itachibot • Plasma cells are absent throughout the body XLA is characterized by the failure of B-cell precursors (pro-B cells and pre-B cells) to develop into \nmature B cells. It is associated with mutations in a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called Bruton \ntyrosine kinase (Btk). The related gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome. This X-linked disease is seen \nalmost entirely in males. The disease usually does not become apparent until about 6 months of \nage, when maternal immunoglobulins are depleted.

      "explanation": "The CD4 cells are affected by HIV due to their interaction with gp120. HIV-1 virion is spherical and contains an electron-dense, cone-shaped core surrounded by a lipid \nenvelope derived from the host cell membrane. Target cells of HIV include CD4+ helper T cells \n(worst affected), monocyte-macrophages, and dendritic cells. The virus core contains: • Major capsid protein p24 • Nucleocapsid protein p7/p9 • Two copies of viral genomic RNA • The three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase) The viral core is surrounded by a matrix protein called p17, which lies underneath the virion \nenvelope. The viral envelope is studded by two viral glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which are \ncritical for HIV infection of cells. Viral glycoprotein gp120 binds to CD4+ cells in the host. CXCR4 and CCR5 function as \ncoreceptors for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells. This binding leads to a conformational change in \ngp41 causing exposure of a hydrophobic region called the fusion peptide at the tip of gp41. This \npeptide inserts into the cell membrane of the target cells (e.g., T cells or macrophages), leading to \nthe fusion of the virus with the host cell.

HIV enters the body and affects T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Particularly, memory \nand activated T cells are infected, but it is inefficient at productively infecting naive (unactivated) \nT cells. Completion of the viral life cycle in latently infected cells occurs only after cell activation, and in \nthe case of most CD4+ T cells, virus activation results in cell lysis.

At least two mechanisms appear to underlie the increased risk of B-cell tumors in HIV-infected \nindividuals. They are: • The unchecked proliferation of B cells infected with oncogenic herpes viruses in the setting of \nprofound T-cell depletion (AIDS). • Germinal center B-cell hyperplasia in the setting of early HIV infection.
