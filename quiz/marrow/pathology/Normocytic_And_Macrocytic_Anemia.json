      "explanation": "Ileal resection for Crohn's disease can cause megaloblastic anaemia due to the decrease in cubilin \nreceptors. They are the vitamin B12 receptors on the ileum. Absorption of vitamin B12 involves the following steps: • Pepsin in the stomach releases vitamin B12 from the binding proteins in the food • Released B12 binds to haptocorrin, which is a salivary protein • In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases release B12 from haptocorrin • B12 binds to intrinsic factor to form IF-B12 complex • In the ileum, ileal enterocytes that contain cubulin receptors (IF receptor) endocytose the \ncomplex • In the ileal cells, B12 is associated with transcobalamin II, which is a carrier protein • B12 is delivered to the liver, bone marrow and GIT 348 \nSold by @itachibot",
