It commonly involves the lower \ncervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes. It commonly affects adolescents and \nyoung adults. It has an excellent prognosis. Mixed-cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma is seen in patients older than 50 years of age. There is a \nmale predominance.

      "explanation": "An owl-eyed appearance of giant cells in lymph nodes is characteristic of Hodgkin's lymphoma \n(HL). Mesenteric lymph nodes are infrequently involved in HL. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a group of lymphoid neoplasms arising in a single group of lymph \nnodes. Extranodal involvement is uncommon. However, if it spreads from the nodes, the first \norgan to be involved is the spleen, then the liver, and finally the bone marrow. This pattern of \nspread is known as the contiguous spread. This predictable route of spread is important clinically as it aids in staging and prognosis as well \nas treatment of HL.",

      "explanation": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-B is a common event in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma \n(HL). NF-B may be activated by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV+ tumor cells express latent \nmembrane protein-1 (LMP-1) which upregulates NF-B. Activation of NF-B may occur in \nEBV tumors as a result of the acquired loss-of-function mutations in TNF alpha-induced protein 3 \n(TNFAIP3). Activation of NF-B by EBV rescues crippled germinal center B cells that cannot express Igs from \napoptosis, eventually leading to the formation of Reed–Sternberg cells.",

This cyclical fever may be due to \nthe release of cytokines.
