Option B: In focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, there is focal and segmental hyalinosis and \nsclerosis of the capillary wall with lipid droplets in the sclerosed area. Option D: In lupus nephritis, immune complex deposits are seen in the mesangium or along the \nentire basement membrane (wire loop lesions), with mesangial cell proliferation.",

Among the given options, anti- GBM antibody \ntesting should be done, since it is a part of the work-up of RPGN. 797 \nSold by @itachibot Type 1 RPGN includes renal limited disease and Goodpasture's disease. In this condition, \nantibodies are produced against the non-collagenous domain of the 3 chain of collagen IV of the \nGBM. Microscopy findings of Goodpasture's disease are: • Immunofluorescence - linear deposits of Ig and complement along the glomerular basement \nmembrane • Electron microscopy - wrinkling of the glomerular basement membrane with focal \ndisruptions without any immune complex deposition. A variant of Goodpasture's disease with pulmonary involvement is known as Goodpasture's \nsyndrome. Option A: ANA testing is done if SLE is suspected. Electron microscopy will show immune \ncomplex deposits. 798 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: HIV RNA testing is done in immunodeficiency syndrome associated with weight loss. \nElectron microscopy will show diffuse podocyte injury with complete foot process effacement. \nTubuloreticular inclusions will be seen in endothelial cells.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is seen in HIV, SLE, CLL, and Hepatitis B. MPGN is caused due to immune-mediated injury. It often presents with a nephritic-nephrotic \npicture. The causes of MPGN are as follows: • Primary MPGN (Idiopathic) • Secondary MPGN • System lupus erythematosus (SLE) • 1-antitrypsin deficiency • Infections - hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, schistosomiasis, endocarditis, infected ventriculoatrial \nshunts, chronic visceral abscesses • Malignancies - chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) MPGN is characterized by the proliferation of cells predominantly in the mesangium and the \ncapillary loops. Hence it is also called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. There are 2 types of \nMPGN: • Type I - It is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes and mesangiocapillary \nproliferation. • Type II - It is now known as dense-deposit disease. It belongs to a group of disorders called C3 \nglomerulopathies. Light microscopy findings of MPGN are as follows: • Lobular glomeruli with proliferating mesangial cells, capillary endothelium, and infiltrating \nleukocytes (endocapillary proliferation) • Duplication of the basement membrane gives a double contour or tram-track appearance. It \nis especially evident in silver or PAS stains. 799 \nSold by @itachibot 800 \nSold by @itachibot Tubulointerstitial, Vascular and Cystic Diseases",
