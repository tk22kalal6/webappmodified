      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Mendelian disorders are caused by single-gene mutations. A mutation is defined as a permanent change in the genetic material that can result in altered \nprotein function and phenotypic changes. Mutations that affect germ cells are transmitted to the progeny and can give rise to inherited \ndiseases. Human genetic disorders can be broadly classified into three categories: • Single-gene mutations - these diseases usually follow the classic Mendelian pattern of \ninheritance. • Chromosomal disorders - These arise from the structural or numerical alteration in the \nautosomes and sex chromosomes. Like a monogenic disease, they are uncommon but associated \nwith high penetrance. • Complex multigenic disorders - They are more common and are caused by interactions between \nmultiple variant forms of genes and environmental factors. Such variations in genes are common \nwithin the population and are also called polymorphisms.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A non-sense mutation is seen in  0 thalassemia. A point mutation is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base. The point \nmutations within the coding sequences of the DNA are of two types: 153 \nSold by @itachibot • Missense mutations: These involve alteration of a single base in a triplet of bases. It leads to the \nreplacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product. These mutations alter the meaning \nof the sequence of the encoded protein. Based on the substituted amino acid coded, the missense \nmutations are again of two types: • Conservative missense mutation: The substituted amino acid is biochemically similar to the \noriginal. It typically causes little change in the function of the protein. • Non-conservative missense mutation: This type of mutation replaces the normal amino acid with \na biochemically different one. • Nonsense mutations: It is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature \nstop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a stop codon \n(UAG) if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of  -globin gene \ntranslation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of \n -globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called  0 thalassemia. Option B: -thalassemias are caused by inherited deletions that result in the reduced or absent \nsynthesis of -globin chains. Option C: Sickle-cell anemia is an example of non-conservative missense mutation. It occurs due \nto the replacement of the 6th glutamic acid by valine in the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11. Option D: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the \nred cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid less deformable and vulnerable to \nsplenic sequestration and destruction.",

      "explanation": "ABO blood group and HLA are both examples of codominant inheritance. In a codominant phenotype, alleles of a gene pair in a heterozygote are fully expressed. Thereby \nresulting in an offspring with a phenotype that is neither dominant nor recessive and both the \nalleles of a gene pair contributes to the phenotype. Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive: • A dominant allele produces a dominant phenotype in individuals who have one copy of the \nallele, which can come from just one parent. • A recessive allele produces a recessive phenotype, in individuals who have two copies of the \nallele, one from each parent.

For example, in sickle-cell anemia, the point mutation in the gene not only predisposes the red \nblood cells to hemolysis but can also block the vessels. This leads to splenic fibrosis, organ \ninfarcts, and bone changes. The numerous differing end-organ derangements are all related to the \nprimary defect in hemoglobin synthesis. Option B: In variable expressivity, a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but is \nexpressed differently among them.

      "explanation": "The mode of inheritance of Ehler–Danlos syndrome (EDS) encompasses two Mendelian patterns, \nnamely: • Autosomal dominant • Autosomal recessive The biosynthesis of collagen can be disturbed by genetic errors that may affect any one of the \nnumerous structural collagen genes or enzymes necessary for posttranscriptional modifications of \ncollagen. Such molecular heterogeneity results in the expression of EDS as a clinically variable \ndisorder, with varied patterns of inheritance.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of the kyphoscoliotic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). \nThis was previously known as Type VI EDS. The kyphoscoliotic form of EDS is caused by the deficient activity of the enzyme \nprocollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1, or lysyl hydroxylase 1). It is a generalized connective tissue disorder characterized by: • Friable hyperextensible skin • Thin scars • Easy bruising • Generalized joint laxity • Severe muscular hypotonia at birth • Progressive scoliosis may be present at birth or may develop within the first year of life",
