      "explanation": "Osteoclasts are specialized multinucleated macrophages derived from circulating monocytes that \nare responsible for bone resorption. Osteocytes are formed when osteoblasts are embedded in the matrix within lacunae and \ncanaliculi. They control calcium and phosphate levels in the microenvironment. Osteoblasts are mesenchymal cells that rim the bony spicule, responsible for bone synthesis and \nmineralization. Chondrocytes are specialized cells that produce and maintain the extracellular matrix of cartilage. The image given below shows different cells present in a bone.",

The remainder is \nseen as part of the multiple hereditary exostosis syndromes, an autosomal-dominant hereditary \ndisease. Lesions arise from the metaphysis near the growth plate of long tubular bones, especially near the \nknee. They are either sessile or pedunculated and range in size from 1 to 20 cm. Histologically, the \ncap is composed of benign hyaline cartilage varying in thickness and is covered peripherally by \nperichondrium. Osteochondromas can progress to chondrosarcoma.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteopetrosis. It occurs due to autosomal recessive \ndefects in the gene for the enzyme carbonic anhydrase II. Carbonic anhydrase II is required by osteoclasts and renal tubular cells to generate protons from \ncarbon dioxide and water (acidification). The absence of carbonic anhydrase II prevents \nosteoclasts from acidifying the resorption pit and dissolution of calcium hydroxyapatite within the \nbone matrix. It also blocks the acidification of urine by the renal tubular cells. This leads to \nreduced bone resorption and diffuse symmetric skeletal sclerosis. Due to deficient osteoclast activity, bones involved by osteopetrosis lack a medullary canal giving \nit a bone-in-bone appearance. The ends of long bones are bulbous (Erlenmeyer flask deformity) \nand misshapen. The neural foramina are small and compress the exiting nerves, leading to cranial \nnerve palsies. Extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis leads to leukopenia and prominent \nhepatosplenomegaly. As carbonic anhydrase II is widely expressed, mutations of this gene result \nin a condition called marble brain disease or Guibaud-Vainsel syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteoporosis. Cytokines stimulate osteoclast \nrecruitment and activity in osteoporosis by increasing the levels of RANKL. RANKL helps in diminishing the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), increasing osteoclast \nproliferation, and preventing osteoclast apoptosis. Decreased estrogen levels after menopause actually increase both bone resorption and formation. \nHowever, the latter does not keep up with the former, leading to a high turnover. Decreased \nestrogen appears to increase the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-, and \nIL-1.",

      "explanation": "Paget disease is monostotic in about 15% of cases and polyostotic in the rest of them. Paget disease (osteitis deformans) is a disorder of increased, but disordered and structurally \nunsound, bone mass. The onset is in late adulthood (average age at diagnosis, 70 years). It occurs due to mutations in the SQSTM1 gene. This increases the activity of NF-B, which \nthen increases osteoclast activity. Three sequential phases exist: • Initial osteolytic stage • Mixed osteoclastic-osteoblastic stage • Final burned-out quiescent osteosclerotic stage The axial skeleton or proximal femur is involved in up to 80% of the cases. The typical x-ray \nfindings are as follows: • Enlargement of the craniofacial skeleton: leontiasis ossea or lion face • Invagination of the skull base (platybasia) • Chalk stick-type fractures in the long bones of the lower extremities The pathological hallmark is a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone, seen in the sclerotic phase as \nshown below.

The average age of patients with secondary chondrosarcoma is 35 years (less than that of those \nwith primary tumors). These tumors most commonly affect the pelvic bones. The increased \nthickness of the cartilage cap (normally 1–3 mm) is considered an indicator of potential \nmalignancy. Multiple enchondromas in the setting of Ollier’s disease or Maffucci's syndrome carry a \nsignificantly higher risk of transformation to secondary chondrosarcoma than solitary \nenchondromas. Histological findings of abundant myxoid change, cyst formation, and permeation \nof existing trabeculae suggest malignancy.

Ewing sarcoma follows osteosarcoma as the second most common group of bone sarcomas in \nchildren. It generally affects patients &lt; 20 years. Boys are affected slightly more frequently than \ngirls. Usually, the tumor arises in the diaphysis of long tubular bones, especially the femur and the \nflat bones of the pelvis. Fever, elevated sedimentation rate, anemia, and leukocytosis may be seen. Plain radiographs \nshow a destructive lytic tumor with permeative margins that extend into the surrounding soft \ntissues. The characteristic periosteal reaction produces layers of reactive bone deposited in an \nonion-skin fashion. It arises in the medullary cavity and usually invades the cortex, periosteum, \nand soft tissue. On microscopy, sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant cytoplasm are seen, which may \nappear clear because they are rich in glycogen.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteoclastoma/ giant-cell tumor (GCT) of bone. GCT is a relatively uncommon benign, but locally aggressive, neoplasm that usually arises in \nindividuals in their 20s to 40s. The neoplastic cells express high levels of RANKL. It promotes the \nproliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts via RANK \nexpressed by these cells. 1236 \nSold by @itachibot GCTs arise in the epiphysis but may extend into the metaphysis. The majority arise around the \nknee (distal femur and proximal tibia). Most are solitary, multicentric tumors in the distal \nextremities. The tumors destroy the overlying cortex, producing a bulging soft tissue mass \ndelineated by a thin shell of reactive tissue. Histopathologically, sheets of uniform oval mononuclear cells and numerous osteoclast-type giant \ncells are seen with 100 or more nuclei. Necrosis and mitotic activity may be prominent. The image given below shows the histopathological findings seen in osteoclastoma. Typically, they are treated with curettage, but 40% to 60% recur locally. Up to 4% of tumors metastasize to the lungs, but these sometimes spontaneously regress and they \nare rarely fatal. The RANKL inhibitor, denosumab, has shown promise as adjuvant therapy in \nGCT.
