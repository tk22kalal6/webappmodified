It is seen in people over 50 years of age. It usually \npresents with facial pain or headache along the course of the superficial temporal artery. It can also affect: • Ophthalmic arteries- leading to sudden onset diplopia or blindness • Aorta- leading to giant-cell aortitis • Vertebral arteries A biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A negative biopsy cannot exclude the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. It is because the lesions are \nfocally distributed. A biopsy sample may be taken from the normal part of the artery leading to a \nfalse-negative report. An adequate biopsy requires at least a 1-cm segment. Biopsy findings: • Giant cell arteritis is primarily medial granulomatous inflammation. • These lesions involve the internal elastic lamina leading to elastic lamina fragmentation. • There is intimal thickening that reduces the luminal diameter. Granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ &gt;CD8+), and \nmacrophages. Note : According to the 21st edition of Harrison's Medicine, as involvement of the vessel may be \nsegmental, getting a biopsy segment of 3–5 cm together with serial sectioning of biopsy specimens \nwould help to increase a positive yield. And Robbin's 10th edition mentions that an adequate \nbiopsy requires at least a 1-cm segment.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and radiological findings are suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries, in this \ncase, the aortic arch and its branches. Clinical manifestations include vision disturbances and \nprofound weakening of the pulses, especially in the upper extremities. Histopathology: • Irregular thickening of the vessel wall is seen with associated intimal hyperplasia. • Characteristic granulomatous inflammation, with the presence of giant cells and patchy medial \nnecrosis. • Disease progression is associated with collagenous scarring and chronic inflammatory infiltrates \nacross all layers of the vessel wall. Other options- Option A: Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is an inflammation of \nmedium and large-sized vessels. It is more common in women and people aged &gt;50 years. The clinical features include headache associated with scalp pain and jaw claudication, fever, \nfatigue, malaise, and weight loss. Half of the patients have temporal artery abnormalities such as \nenlargement, tenderness, nodular swelling, and loss of pulse of the temporal artery, either \nunilateral or bilateral. Gentle pressure on the scalp may elicit focal or generalized tenderness. Though the arch of the aorta may also be involved in giant cell arteritis (known as giant cell \naortitis), it is seen in people more than 50 years of age. Whereas, Takayasu arteritis is seen more \ncommonly in adolescents and young women. Option C: Thromboangitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is an inflammatory \nocclusive vascular disorder involving medium- and small-sized vessels in the distal extremities. It \nis most frequently seen in male smokers less than 40 years of age. 665 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Behcet's disease is a neutrophilic vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels \nthat classically presents as a clinical triad of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and \nuveitis.

Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory and stenotic disease of medium and large-sized arteries \ncharacterized by a strong predilection for the aortic arch and its branches.

Takayasu arteritis causes irregular thickening of the vessel wall with intimal hyperplasia leading \nto narrowing of the lumen and organ ischemia. It may have various clinical presentations depending on the vessel involved: • Arch of aorta and its branches: • Subclavian artery- leads to weak pulses in the upper extremities. Hence it is also known as \npulseless disease • Carotid arteries- leads to weak pulses, blindness, neurological deficits • Distal aorta- leads to claudication of the legs • Pulmonary artery- leads to pulmonary hypertension • Coronary arteries- leads to myocardial infarction • Renal arteries- leads to systemic hypertension",

The patient may present with the following clinical features: • Skin lesions- characteristically involve the extensor surfaces of arms and legs, and also the \nbuttocks • Abdominal manifestations- include pain, vomiting, and intestinal bleeding. • Renal manifestations- include gross or microscopic hematuria, nephritic or nephrotic syndrome. \nRenal manifestations are more severe in the adults 671 \nSold by @itachibot It is strongly associated with atopy in a few patients, and the onset often follows an upper \nrespiratory infection. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to \nthat of IgA nephropathy.",

It principally involves the tibial and radial arteries. It is seen in heavy cigarette smokers, usually before the age of 35 years. HLA-A-9 and \nHLA-B-5 associated with a high risk of TAO. The patients present with intermittent claudication, chronic ulcerations of the extremity, and later \nprogress to frank gangrene. The microscopy findings include luminal thrombosis (thrombangiitis), \nthat is, thrombus containing microabscesses that occlude the lumen (obliterans). They contain \nsmall microabscesses composed of neutrophils. Berger disease refers to IgA nephropathy. It is seen within 3-5 days of sore throat.
