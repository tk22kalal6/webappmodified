      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Wilson's disease is caused due to a loss-of-function mutation in the ATP7B gene. It an autosomal \nrecessive condition. The ATP7B gene is located on chromosome 13q. The gene encodes a copper transporting ATPase \n(ATP7B) which has 2 functions: • Maintains copper in bound form by binding copper to apoceruloplasmin • Helps excrete free copper in bile. 943 \nSold by @itachibot The resulting ATP7B deficiency leads to reduced bound copper and impaired free copper \nexcretion. This causes excess deposition of free copper in the tissues, particularly in the liver, \nbrain and eye. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive condition leading to impaired absorption of copper and \nsubsequent copper deficiency. Here, the mutation is in the ATP7A gene.",

It might be related to \nmaternal alloimmune injury to the fetal liver. Adult hemochromatosis is generally a milder disease than the juvenile form. With treatment, life \nexpectancy is normal. Bantu siderosis or African iron overload is due to dietary iron overload. Consumption of beer \nprepared in iron pots or drums is the cause of dietary iron overload. Skin pigmentation in hemochromatosis mostly results from increased melanin synthesis. This \nis due to iron deposition and not hemosiderin deposition. In severe hemochromatosis, total iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm. More than one-third of \nthis accumulates in the liver. In normal adults, it is in the range of 2 to 6 gms.",
