      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ingestion of ethylene \nglycol. Toxins usually result in ATN by causing damage to the proximal convoluted tubules \n(PCTs). Ethylene glycol poisoning produces marked ballooning and hydropic or vacuolar degeneration of \nPCT. Calcium oxalate crystals are often also found in tubular lumens. Direct toxic injury to the tubules in ATI can be caused by: • Endogenous agents: Myoglobin, hemoglobin, monoclonal light chains, bile/bilirubin • Exogenous agents: Drugs, radiocontrast dyes, heavy metals, and organic solvents",

Fever is also a non-specific \nfinding. Ascending infection is the most common cause of clinical pyelonephritis.
