      "explanation": "The most common sites of the following conditions are: A true diverticulum is a blind outpouching of the alimentary tract that communicates with the \nlumen and includes all three layers of the bowel wall. The most common true diverticulum \nis Meckel's diverticulum. It most commonly occurs in the ileum. It occurs as a result of the failed \ninvolution of the vitelline duct, which connects the lumen of the developing gut to the yolk sac. The following image shows a Meckel's diverticulum. Condition \nSite 1. True diverticulum \nB. Ileum 2. Acquired diverticulu \nm D. Sigmoid colo \nn 3. Crohn's disease \nA. Terminal ileu \nm 4. Polyps \nC. Colorectum 1039 \nSold by @itachibot On the other hand, false or acquired diverticula either lack the muscularis entirely or have an \nattenuated muscularis propria. Though Crohn's disease most commonly occurs in the terminal ileum, it may occur in any area of \nthe GI tract. Polyps are most common in the colorectal region. They can be sessile (without stalk) \nor pedunculated (with stalk). Intestinal polyps can be classified as non-neoplastic or neoplastic in \nnature. The nonneoplastic polyps can be further classified as inflammatory, hamartomatous, or \nhyperplastic. The most common neoplastic polyp is an adenoma.",

      "question": "Question 2: Which of the following is true about the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Failure of migration of neural crest cells",
        "b": "Loss of ganglion cells",

        "d": "Obstruction by inflammatory stricture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hirschsprung disease occurs due to the failure of migration of the neural crest cells to the bowel \nwall. During normal embryogenesis, the neural crest cells migrate from the caecum to the rectum. The \nenteric neuronal plexuses develop from these migrated neural crest cells. In Hirschsprung disease, there is an arrest in the migration of these cells, which leads to the \ndevelopment of a distal intestinal segment that is devoid of Meissner (submucosal) and the \nAuerbach (myenteric) plexus. Hence this segment is referred to as the aganglionic segment. As a result, there is a lack of coordination in the peristaltic contractions and functional \nobstruction, which further leads to the dilation of the intestine proximal to the affected segment, \nleading to congenital megacolon. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of \nganglion cells in biopsy sections. 1040 \nSold by @itachibot Some conditions may cause acquired megacolon. These include: • Chagas disease, due to the loss of ganglion cells • Visceral myopathy • Obstruction by neoplasm or inflammatory stricture • Toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis • Functional psychosomatic disorders",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease. It is associated with Down's syndrome. Hirschsprung disease is also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon. 10% of all cases occur in \nchildren with Down's syndrome. The premature arrest of normal migration of neural crest cells from the cecum to the rectum \nproduces aganglionosis of the distal intestinal segment. This causes functional obstruction of the \naffected bowel and proximal dilation. The absence of ganglion cells in the affected segment in \nbiopsy confirms the diagnosis. 1041 \nSold by @itachibot Gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Down's syndrome include: • Duodenal atresia • Annular pancreas • Hirschsprung disease Gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) include: • Meckel's diverticulum • Malrotation Gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) include: • Omphalocele • Incomplete rotation of the colon • Meckel's diverticulum",

      "explanation": "1044 \nSold by @itachibot The given scenario is suggestive of Crohn's disease. It is strongly associated with mutations in the \nnucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2 (NOD2) gene. Crohn's disease occurs due to the host response against microbes. NOD2 encodes an intracellular \nprotein that binds to bacterial peptidoglycans and activates the NF-B pathway. Antibodies \nagainst the bacterial protein flagellin may be seen in NOD2-associated disease. Other Crohn's disease-related genes are autophagy-related 16-like (ATG16L1), and \nimmunity-related GTPase M (IRGM), which are critical for cellular responses to intracellular \nbacteria. Crohn's disease most commonly involves the terminal ileum but can affect all parts of the GIT. \nThe following microscopic changes may be seen: • Aphthoid ulcerations • Focal crypt abscesses • Non-caseating granulomas can be found in all layers of the bowel, lymph nodes, mesentery, \nperitoneum, liver, and pancreas Note: Ulcerative colitis-associated genes are ECM1 and HNFA.",
