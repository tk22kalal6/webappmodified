GNAS mutation causes pituitary adenoma and other endocrine tumors. 225 \nSold by @itachibot The 3 RAS genes in humans (H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS) are the most common oncogenes in \nhuman cancer. They code for a family of proteins called GTP-binding (G) proteins, which are \ninvolved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). When RAS is 'switched \non' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately results in \ncell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in RAS genes can lead to the production of permanently activated RAS proteins. As a \nresult, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of \nincoming signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive RAS \nsignaling can ultimately lead to cancer.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Retinoblastoma is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Knudson's hypothesis, also known as the two-hit hypothesis or multiple-hit hypothesis states that \ncancer is the result of accumulated mutations in a cell's DNA. Two mutations (hits), involving both \nalleles of RB at chromosome locus 13q14, are required to produce retinoblastoma. In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germline (the first hit), \nand the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB allele is mutated in \nretinoblasts as a result of a spontaneous somatic mutation (the second hit). Most individuals \ninheriting a germline defect in one RB allele develop unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma as it is \nan autosomal dominant disease. Sporadic cases are comparitively rare.

      "explanation": "If the retinoblastoma (RB) gene is hypophosphorylated, it is active and the cell cycle will stop at \nG1. RB is a cell-cycle regulator because it binds to and inactivates a transcription factor (E2F). This is \nnecessary for the transcription of certain genes necessary for the progression from the G1 to S \nphase. The phosphorylation of RB results in the release of E2F. This activates gene transcription \nand cell-cycle progression occurs. The image given below shows the cell cycle regulation by RB gene. 227 \nSold by @itachibot",

P53 regulates: • Cell cycle progression • DNA repair • Cellular senescence • Apoptosis It is activated by: • Anoxia • Inappropriate signaling by mutated oncoproteins • DNA damage It is the most frequently mutated gene in cancers. It upregulates the expression of proteins such \nas the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S. It \nalso transactivates and transrepresses target gene to induce G2/M arrest. Mutation in the p53 \ngene causes resistance in tumors to radiation and chemotherapy. The E6 protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) binds to and helps in the degradation of p53 and \nstimulates the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which is the catalytic \nsubunit of telomerase, thereby helping in the longevity of the cells.

It is characterized by the translocation and deregulation of the c-myc \ngene on chromosome 8. The classic t(8;14)(q24;q32) reciprocal translocation results in the transposition of the c-myc \nproto-oncogene on chromosome 8 with one of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes on \nchromosome 14. This results in activation of the c-myc gene and is considered responsible for \ntumor proliferation.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was the first drug to achieve a significant improvement in \nsurvival of advanced-stage melanoma. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) plays an \nimportant inhibitory role in the control of T-cell activation. Ipilimumab is a fully-humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyte \nantigen-4 (CTLA-4). It has been postulated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies act by blocking inhibitory signals from effector \nT-cells, allowing costimulatory signaling and generation of antitumor T-cell responses. In vitro \nstudies demonstrated also that the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 blockade is mediated by Fc \ngamma receptor-expressing macrophage and hypothesized a possible role of regulatory T-cell \ndepletion in the tumor microenvironment. Option B - Mutation of tumor supressor genes is associated with increased risk of cancer. Antigen \ntoxicity is when the immune response to an antigen is excessive or misdirected, causing damage to \ntissues or organs. Option C - PD1/PDL1 is an immune checkpoint whose activation inhibits T-cell function and helps \nwith immune tolerance. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using immune checkpoint inhibitors \nreactivates T cells and enhances immune responses against tumors. Option D - CD28 is primarily involved in providing the second signal required for T cell \nactivation. The first signal comes from the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the \nantigen presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells \n(APCs). Without CD28-mediated costimulation, T cells that only receive the TCR signal (without \nthe second signal) can become anergic. 235 \nSold by @itachibot Carcinogenesis, Paraneoplastic Syndromes and Tumor Markers",
