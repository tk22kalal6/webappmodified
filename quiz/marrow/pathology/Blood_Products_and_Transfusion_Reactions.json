Hence, it increases the shelf life. 449 \nSold by @itachibot The disadvantage of using CDPA-1 is that it increases uric acid stone formation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Blood received from blood bank should be completely transfused within 4 hours of receiving. Principles of blood administration: • All blood products should be given through an appropriate blood administration set containing a \nfilter. • A careful aseptic technique should be practised at all times. • Vital signs should be documented before and after transfusion and as clinically required. For the \nfirst 15 minutes after the infusion has begun, the patient should be kept under close observation \nto detect any signs of a serious transfusion reaction. If none is observed, the infusion rate may be \nincreased. • One unit of red cells is often given in 1 to 4 hours, depending on the amount to be transfused \nand on the patient’s cardiovascular status. Infusion of a unit for longer than 4 hours is not \nrecommended, as there is a risk of bacterial proliferation because the opened unit is at room \ntemperature. • No other solution and no medication should be added to or infused through the same tubing as a \nblood product. • Ringer’s lactate or other solutions containing calcium must never be added to a blood product \nbecause the calcium present leads to coagulation. • After the transfusion has been completed, the transfusion tag or record should become part of \nthe patient’s chart.",

      "explanation": "Patients with thrombocytopenia receiving blood transfusions (platelets) are more prone to develop \nbacterial sepsis. Sepsis is mostly due to significant bacterial contamination of the blood products. Platelets have \nthe maximum risk of causing this condition when compared to red cell preparations. Since \npatients with thrombocytopenia receive platelet transfusion, they are at an increased risk of \ninfections. Platelets (unlike red cells) must be stored at room temperature. This is a condition that \nis favourable for bacterial proliferation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics must be started while waiting \nfor the culture reports.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is sudden-onset respiratory failure that occurs \nduring or soon after the transfusion. It occurs within 6 hours, and not after 2 days following \ntransfusion. TRALI is a severe fatal complication of blood transfusion. The incidence of TRALI is low (1 per \n10,000 transfusions). However, it may occur more frequently in patients with preexisting lung \ndisease. The pathogenesis involves a two-hit hypothesis: • Priming event - increased sequestration and sensitization of neutrophils in the microvasculature \nof the lung • Second hit - the factor (most commonly MHC class I antigens) present in the transfused blood \nproduct activates the primed neutrophils TRALI can occur in transfusions with all plasma-containing blood products. However, it is more \nlikely to occur following the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets. This is because \nthese products contain high levels of donor antibodies. Note: TRALI is important to recognize because donor products that induce complications in one \npatient are much more likely to do so in a second. Indeed, recent measures to exclude \nmultiparous women from plasma donation have resulted in reduced incidence of TRALI. 452 \nSold by @itachibot",
