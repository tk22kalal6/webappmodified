      "explanation": "Adenocarcinoma of the colon is the most common malignancy of the GI tract. Tumors in the proximal colon often grow as polypoid, exophytic masses. These tumors rarely \ncause obstruction. Carcinomas of the distal colon tend to be annular lesions that produce napkin-ring constrictions \nand luminal narrowing.",
