Morphological changes that occur in necrosis are as follows: Cytoplasmic changes - • Increased eosinophilic staining on H&amp;E specimens • Moth-eaten appearance of the cytoplasm - due vacuolated cytoplasmic organelles formed by \nenzymatic degradation • Glassy and homogenous cytoplasm - due to loss of glycogen in the cytoplasm Nuclear changes - • Pyknosis - nucleus first shrinks and becomes more condensed • Karyorrhexis - fragmentation of the pyknotic nucleus • Karyolysis - nucleus fades away leaving behind only the cell membrane or empty cells",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and image showing dead tissue are suggestive of myocardial \ninfarction. It is characterized by coagulative necrosis. In coagulative necrosis, despite cell death, the outline and architecture of the cells are preserved \nfor a few days. This is because the cell injury is mainly due to the denaturation of all proteins, \nincluding the enzymatic proteins. This prevents the proteolysis of the dead cells. Ultimately, these \nnecrotized cells are removed by phagocytosis and the lysosomal action of the enzymes of the \nleukocytes. Examples of coagulative necrosis: • Ischemic injury in all organs, except the brain • Dry gangrene",

It is \nprominent in the liver and heart of aging patients or patients with severe malnutrition and cancer \ncachexia. Autophagy is a process by which the cell consumes itself. It involves the sequestration of cellular \norganelles into cytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes) that fuse with lysosomes, \nresulting in the digestion of the enclosed material. It occurs in the following conditions: • As a survival mechanism during nutrient deprivation and stress conditions • Cancers, inflammatory bowel diseases, neurodegenerative disorders - due to dysregulation",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is a reliable marker for cellular autophagy. There is increased synthesis of this molecule during autophagy. LC3 plays a role in elongation and \nclosure of the autophagosomal membrane. Autophagy (self-eating) is the process in which the starved cell eats its own components in an \nattempt to reduce nutrient demand to match the supply. Option A: Atg5 protein, although associated with autophagy, is not a reliable marker as there is no \ndifferential expression during autophagy initiation. Option B: RIP3 (receptor associated kinase 3) is a unique kinase involved in necroptosis. Option D: Annexin V is a marker for cellular apoptosis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent pathway of cell death that is induced by lipid peroxidation. It is triggered by an increase in membrane lipid peroxidation in response to the following signals: • Excessive intracellular levels of iron • Reactive oxygen species (ROS) This leads to a loss of selective permeability of the plasma membrane, which ultimately leads to \ncell death. Unlike necrosis, the process is regulated by specific signals and can, therefore, be \nprevented by reducing iron levels. Ferroptosis has been linked to cell death in a variety of human pathologies including: • Cancer 44 \nSold by @itachibot • Neurodegenerative diseases • Stroke Other forms of cell death that are not dependent on lipid peroxidation include: • Necroptosis or programmed necrosis - programmed cell death without caspase activation • Pyroptosis - programmed cell death that is dependent on caspases 1, 4, and 5",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disorder caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha \nglucosidase enzyme. It is not due to abnormal folded proteins. During normal protein synthesis, chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) control the \nproper folding of newly synthesized proteins. Misfolded polypeptides are ubiquitinated and \ntargeted for proteolysis. Sometimes, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER as a result of inherited \nmutations or environmental stress. This induces a protective response called the unfolded protein \nresponse that increases the production of chaperones. This reduces the levels of misfolded \nproteins in the cell. However, when the accumulation of misfolded proteins overwhelms these adaptations, it results \nin ER stress which leads to the activation of caspases and, ultimately, apoptosis. Some diseases that occur due to the accumulation of abnormal folded proteins are: • Alzheimer's disease • Huntington's disease • Parkinson's disease • Prion diseases • Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis • Tay-Sachs disease 45 \nSold by @itachibot HunłingtÎn atnxins \nBOD1 \nPrion Çqj-ses \nPresenilin 1 a-synucleìn \nPresønilìn 2 46 \nSold by @itachibot Intracellular Accumulations, Pathological Calcification and Cellular Ageing",
