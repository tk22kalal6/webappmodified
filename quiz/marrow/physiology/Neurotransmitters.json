      "explanation": "Glycine is not a biogenic amine. It is an amino acid. Biogenic amines are made from amino acid precursors. They have a nitrogen containing amine \n(NH2) group. Unlike the amino acids, the biogenic amines lack a carboxyl (COOH) group. \nNorepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine are biogenic amines.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The hyperkinetic feature of Huntington's disease is due to the loss of intrastriatal GABAergic and \ncholinergic neurons. The loss of the GABAergic pathway (which is an inhibitory pathway) to the \nglobus pallidus external segment and loss of cholinergic neurons in many parts of the brain \ndecreases inhibition, causing the hyperkinetic feature of the disease to develop.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Botulinum toxin prevents the release of Ach at the presynaptic membrane. Botulinum toxins A, B, and E are toxic to humans. They cleave components of SNARE - a complex \nof proteins necessary for the exocytosis of acetylcholine. Toxins A and E cleave SNAP-25 whereas \ntoxin B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) also known as synaptobrevin. Cleavage of SNARE proteins prevents the release of acetylcholine as the vesicles containing Ach \nare unable to bind to the presynaptic membrane. 205 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Tetanus toxin affects the release of GABA. Tetanus toxin escapes normal lysosomal degradation and crosses the synapse to the GABA-ergic \npresynaptic inhibitory interneuron terminals. The toxin blocks the release of inhibitory \nneurotransmitters (glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid) across the synaptic cleft. This blockage \nof the inhibitory neurotransmitters causes spastic paralysis.",
