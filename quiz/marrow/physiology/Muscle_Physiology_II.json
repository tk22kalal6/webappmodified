      "explanation": "Phosphorylation of phospholamban is responsible for the positive inotropic effect on the \nmyocardium observed after the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Phospholamban is a protein that regulates Ca2+ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When \nphosphorylated, phospholamban stimulates the Ca2+ ATPase, resulting in greater uptake and \nstorage of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increased Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum has two effects: It causes faster relaxation (i.e., briefer contraction). it increases the amount of stored Ca2+ for release on subsequent beats. This positive inotropic effect has three important features: increased peak tension, increased rate \nof tension development, and faster rate of relaxation. Faster relaxation means that the contraction (twitch) is shorter, allowing more time for refilling. This effect is mediated via activation of 1 receptors, which are coupled via a Gs protein to \nadenylyl cyclase. Activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to the production of cAMP, activation of protein kinases, and \nphosphorylation of proteins that produce the physiologic effect of increased contractility.",

In cardiac myocytes, depolarization proceeds rapidly and an overshoot of the zero potential is \npresent.

Repolarization is therefore not complete until \ncontraction is 50% completed. Phases of cardiac action potential • 0 Depolarisation and overshoot • Due to opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels • 1 Initial rapid repolarization • Due to closure of Na+ channels and opening up of K+ channels • 2 Plateau phase • Due to slow but prolonged opening of Ca2+ channels • 3 late rapid repolarization • 4 Baseline (RMP) • Phases 3 and 4 are due closure of Ca2+ channels and a slow, delayed increase of K+ efflux \nthrough K+ channels. • During phases 0 to 2 and about half of phase 3 of cardiac action potential, cardiac muscle cannot \nbe excited again, that is, it is in its absolute refractory period.

Stretch is followed by a decrease in membrane potential and an increase \nin the tone of the muscle. Other options: Option a: Troponin is absent in smooth muscle. Option b: Sustained contraction of the smooth muscle occurs even when the calcium \nconcentration falls.

The \nadding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle \ncontraction is Summation. Summation occurs in two ways: • by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is multiple ■ber \nsummations. • by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead to \ntetanization.
