      "explanation": "60% of aldosterone is bound to plasma proteins, not 80%. 90% of cortisol is bound to plasma proteins. Most of it is bound to transcortin, a \ncorticosteroid-specific  2 globulin, and the rest to albumin. This high degree of binding to plasma \nproteins slows the elimination of cortisol. Therefore, cortisol has a longer half-life of 60 to 90 \nminutes. Since only about 60% of aldosterone is in bound form, it has a relatively short half-life of about 20 \nminutes.",

      "explanation": "Cortisol suppresses the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and decreases the number of \nT-Lymphocytes. Actions of Cortisol: Metabolic effects: • Effect on carbohydrates: Exert an anti-insulin effect, leading to hyperglycemia • Increases gluconeogenesis • Increases glycogen synthesis • Decreases utilization of glucose in peripheral tissues • Effect on fat and appetite: promotes mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue in acute \nstates. This mobilization increases the concentration of free fatty acids in the plasma, which also \nincreases their utilization for energy, causing lipolysis. However, in chronic states cortisol \nincreases appetite and food intake by inducing the synthesis of neuropeptide-Y which leads to an \napparent lipogenic effect seen as buffalo humping and central obesity. • Effect on protein: Exerts a catabolic effect and causes proteolysis • Effect on water and electrolytes: Sodium water retention and diuresis Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects: • Induce the synthesis of lipocortin, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 • Inhibit the release of histamine and serotonin • Inhibit the production of IL-2 and T lymphocytes, and depress cellular immunity Maintenance of vascular responsiveness to catecholamines: • Cortisol up-regulates  1 receptors on arterioles, increasing their sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor \neffect of norepinephrine",

Patients with severe COVID are at high risk of developing a systemic inflammatory response. \nSteroids help in mitigating these deleterious effects. Phospholipase A2 is a precursor of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is the precursor for \nprostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are involved in inflammation. Steroids induce the \nsynthesis of lipocortin, which inhibits phospholipase A2.

      "explanation": "Aldosterone increases transport of ENaCs (epithelial sodium channels) from the cytoplasm to the \ncell membrane. This is a rapid effect of aldosterone. Mechanism of action of aldosterone: • Aldosterone diffuses into the renal tubular epithelial cells and combines with a mineralocorticoid \nreceptor (MR) in the cytoplasm. • The aldosterone-receptor complex diffuses into the nucleus and induces transcription. • The mRNA diffuses back into the cytoplasm and undergoes translation to form proteins. These \nhave two effects - Rapid and Slow. • The slower effect is increase in synthesis of ENaCs. • The important products formed are: • Na+K+ATPase • membrane transport proteins like epithelial sodium channel 739 \nSold by @itachibot",

Two primary systems are especially involved in regulating the concentration of sodium and \nosmolarity of extracellular fluid: • The osmoreceptor-ADH system and • The thirst mechanism. Although aldosterone decreases the rate of sodium excretion by the kidneys, the concentration of \nsodium in the extracellular fluid rises only by a few mEqs. The reason for this is that when sodium \nis reabsorbed by the tubules, simultaneous absorption of equivalent amounts of water occurs. So, \naldosterone does not cause a significant change in the plasma osmolality. 740 \nSold by @itachibot",
