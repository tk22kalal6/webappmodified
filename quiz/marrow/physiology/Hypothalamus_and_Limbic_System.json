      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The thalamus is being called the sensory gateway to the cerebral cortex as all information that \nreaches the cortex is processed by the thalamus. The thalamus is a large collection of neuronal groups within the diencephalon; it participates in \nsensory, motor, and limbic functions. Other Options: Option B: Thalamus is the largest part of the diencephalon. Option C: Y shaped band of fibers divide the thalamus into 3 subdivisions- anterior, medial, and \nlateral group. Option D: Thalamus is the sensory gateway to the cortex.",

        "c": "Amygdala",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The amygdala has been called the “window” through which the limbic system sees the place of the \nperson in the world. The amygdala receives neuronal signals from all portions of the limbic cortex, as well as from the \nneocortex of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, especially from the auditory and visual \nassociation areas. Components of the limbic system • The term limbic lobe, or limbic system, is applied to the part of the brain that consists of a rim of \ncortical tissue around the hilum of the cerebral hemisphere and a group of associated deep \nstructures—the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the septal nuclei. • The papez circuit is a closed neural circuitry that starts and ends in the hippocampus, which \nforms the basal ganglia. It is also known as the medial limbic circuit. The components of papez \ncircuit are- Mnemonic-He Man Ate Cat • He-Hippocampus • Man-Mamillary body • Ate-Anterior thalamus • Cat-Cingulate gyrus",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Anterior nucleus of the thalamus is a component of Papez circuit, which is important for short \nterm memory. Papez Circuit (refer figure): The limbic system was studied by James Papez who described the Papez circuit. It consists of: Mnemonic for components of Papez circuit-He Man Ate Cat • He-Hippocampus • Man-Mamillary body • Ate-Anterior thalamus • Cat-Cingulate gyrus The fornix connects the hippocampus to the mammillary bodies, which are in turn connected to \nthe anterior nuclei of the thalamus by the mammillothalamic tract. The anterior nuclei of the \nthalamus project to the cingulate cortex, and from there, connections to the hippocampus \ncomplete a complex closed circuit. The boundaries of the limbic system were subsequently expanded to include the amygdala, \nseptum, basal forebrain, nucleus accumbens, and orbitofrontal cortex. 326 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Major reward centres are located along the course of the medial forebrain bundle, especially in the \nlateral and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Therefore, stimulation of those areas will \npromote a sense of reward. It is interesting to note that in the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, a weak stimulus produces \na sense of pleasure whereas a strong stimulus produces rage. This phenomenon occurs in many \nareas where a weak stimulus produces a sense of reward while stronger ones produce a sense of \npunishment.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus functions as the principal pacemaker, or time \nclock, for circadian rhythms. The pacemaker receives input from the eyes and many other parts of the nervous system, and \nthese inputs mediate the effects exerted by the external environment (retinohypothalamic tract). One output of the pacemaker goes to the pineal gland, a gland within the brain that secretes the \nhormone melatonin.These neural signals cause the pineal gland to secrete melatonin during \ndarkness but not during daylight. 327 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Lesions involving the anterior and preoptic hypothalamic regions cause paradoxical \nvasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. The anterior hypothalamus activates mechanisms of cooling the body when the temperature \nincreases via the reflex response. Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus causes cutaneous vasodilation and sweating, thereby \ncooling the body. Lesions in this region cause hyperthermia, with rectal temperatures sometimes \nreaching 43°C (109.4°F).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Diurnal variation of ACTH depend on suprachiasmatic nucleus. The secretory rates of ACTH and cortisol are high in the early morning but low in the late evening. \nThis effect results from a 24-hour cyclical alteration in the signals from the suprachiasmatic \nnucleus of hypothalamus that cause cortisol secretion.When a person changes daily sleeping \nhabits, the cycle changes correspondingly.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Functions of the categorical hemisphere are logical, analytical, sequential thinking, and verbal \ntasks, such as math, language forms, and philosophy. Human language functions depend more on one cerebral hemisphere than on the other. This \nhemisphere is concerned with categorization and symbolization and has often been called the \ndominant hemisphere. However, the other hemisphere is specialized in the area of spatiotemporal \nrelations. The concept of “cerebral dominance” and a dominant and non-dominant hemisphere has been \nreplaced by, one hemisphere for sequential-analytic processes (the categorical hemisphere) and \none for visuospatial relations (the representational hemisphere). The representational cerebral hemisphere excels in nonlanguage skills, especially spatial \nperception, and artistic and musical talents.",

      "explanation": "Dehydration, hemorrhage, and prandial drinking: All three can cause increased thirst resulting in \nwater drinking. Increased osmolality acts via osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus. The decreased plasma volume, as in hemorrhage, acts via 1. Renin-angiotensin system 2. Baroreceptors in heart and blood vessels. The intake of liquids during a meal is known as prandial drinking. The increase is known as \nlearned or habit response but is not understood completely.
