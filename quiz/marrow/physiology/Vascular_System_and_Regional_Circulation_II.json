      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most powerful activator of the sympathetic vasomotor system is CNS ischemic response. CNS ischemic response: When blood flow to the vasomotor center in lower brainstem (medulla) is severely decreased, the \nlocal concentration of CO2 increases greatly and has a potent effect in stimulating the sympathetic \nvasomotor nervous control areas in the brain’s medulla. Blood pressure may increase till 250 \nmmHg. The strong activation may cause some peripheral vessels to occlude. It doesnt activate till arterial pressure drops to 60mmHg or less, hence it is principally a \nemergency mechanism. Note: Baroreceptors are the most common activators, but not the most powerful.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario describes orthopnea in congestive heart failure. It is due to reservoir function \nof pulmonary veins. Orthopnea is dyspnea occurring in the recumbent position. It results from redistribution of fluid from the splanchnic circulation and lower extremities \n(increased venous return) into the heart during recumbency. This increased venous return is not \nput out by the left ventricle and hence pools in the pulmonary veins that acts as capacitance \nvessels (reservoir function) adding to the already congested pulmonary vasculature resulting in \nbreathing difficulty.",

      "explanation": "The interstitial fluid pressure is negative in the lungs. The interstitial fluid pressure is slightly negative in the body except in the encapsulated organs. It is positive in • Rigid closed compartments- bone marrow, brain • Encapsulated organs - kidney, skeletal muscle This is due to the fact that in the kidneys, high-pressure vessels push the interstitial fluid against \nan unyielding fibrous capsule raising the pressure.

      "explanation": "Blood flow per minute in the pulmonary circulation is equal to flow through the systemic \ncirculation so as to provide continuous blood supply to the body. If the flow rate is slower in the pulmonary circulation than systemic, then the left ventricle would \nsoon empty completely. If the flow rate is faster in the pulmonary circulation then the left \nventricle would be soon overloaded. Please note that because some blood flows into the bronchial arteries, the actual flow through the \npulmonary circulation is slightly lesser than the flow through the systemic circulation.

During transfusion reaction, there is decreased systemic vascular resistance due to system-wide \nvasodilation mediated by release of histamine by mast cells in response to antigen bound IgE, \nleading to distributive shock. Types of circulatory shock: • Hypovolemic shock: due to decreased blood in vascular compartment. E.g., haemorrhage, \ndehydration. • Cardiogenic shock: due to decreased capacity of heart to pump. E.g., any pathology of heart \ndecreasing its ability to maintain cardiac output. • Obstructive shock: due to conditions causing obstruction to blood flow in lungs and \nheart.E.g:pulmonary embolism. • Distributive/vasculogenic shock: excessive vasodilation leading to impaired organ perfusion. E.g: \nseptic shock, SIRS, transfusion reaction, Addisonian crisis, neurogenic shock. Three stages of shock: • Non-progressive: also called compensated shock, where normal compensatory mechanism \neventually causes full recovery without help from outside therapy. • Progressive: also called non-compensated, without therapy it gets steadily worse. • Irreversible: even therapy is inadequate to save life.",

      "explanation": "Thin-walled and delicate vessels like capillaries are less prone to rupture and this can be explained \nby Laplace law. 492 \nSold by @itachibot The principal reason for these vessels' relative invulnerability is their small diameter. The \nprotective effect of small size, in this case, is an example of the law of Laplace. Laplace law states that tension in the wall of a cylinder (T) is equal to the product of the \ntransmural pressure (P) and the radius (r) divided by the wall thickness (w): T = Pr/w As the tissue pressure is low, P is equated to the pressure inside the blood vessel. W can be ignored as well as capillaries are thin walled. Hence: P = T/r In a thin-walled viscus, P = T divided by the two principal radii of curvature of the viscus: P = T \n(1/r1+1/r2) In a cylinder such as a blood vessel, one radius is infinite, so P = T /r Hence, smaller the radius, lower is the tension necessary in the wall to balance the distending \npressure.",
