      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated using the Nernst equation. When there is a concentration gradient for an ion across the membrane, the ion tends to diffuse \ndown the concentration gradient. The electric potential that exactly opposes this net diffusion is \ncalled the equilibrium potential for that ion. This is calculated using the Nernst equation. 59 \nSold by @itachibot It is expressed as the potential inside the cell (intracellular potential relative to the extracellular \npotential). To calculate the value of the equilibrium potential: Note: In this formula, the choice of concentration of the ion placed in the numerator and \ndenominator does not matter because the formula is only used to derive the numerical value and \nnot the sign ( +/- ). Mathematically, log (100/10) = 1 and log (10/100) = - 1. Hence, changing the \nnumerator and denominator only changes the sign and the numerical value remains the same. This equation is used only to derive the numerical value of the potential. It is NOT used to derive \nthe sign/charge (+/-). The sign/charge is derived from logic: • In a positive (+) ion, if the concentration of the + ion is greater outside, then the + ion moves \nfrom outside to inside. The intracellular potential becomes more + relatively. Hence, the potential \nwill be positive. • In a positive (+) ion, if the concentration of the + ion is greater inside, then the + ion moves from \ninside to outside. The intracellular potential becomes more - relatively (as + ion moves outside). \nHence the potential will be negative. • In a negative (-) ion, if the concentration of the - ion is greater outside, then the - ion moves from \noutside to inside. The intracellular potential becomes more - relatively. Hence the potential will be \nnegative. • In a negative (-) ion, if the concentration of the - ion is greater inside, then the - ion moves from \ninside to outside. The intracellular potential becomes more + relatively (as - ion moves outside). \nHence the potential will be positive.",
