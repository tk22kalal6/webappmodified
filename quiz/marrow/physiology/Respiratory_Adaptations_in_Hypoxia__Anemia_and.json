      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Hypoxic hypoxia is characterized by low partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (Pao2), while \nother parameters like partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Paco2) may remain normal. Ventilation–Perfusion Imbalance: • The patchy ventilation–perfusion imbalance is the most common cause of hypoxic hypoxia or \nhypoxemia. • If alveoli are not ventilated but perfusion is present - blood passing through that alveoli remains \nunoxygenated. 439 \nSold by @itachibot • When this unoxygenated blood mixes with blood from normal or overventilated alveoli, there is \na right to left shunt created. • This results in reduced partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (PaO2) i.e., hypoxemia and \nconsequently hypoxia. Note: • Hypoxemia can be defined as a condition where arterial oxygen tension or partial pressure of \noxygen (PaO2) is below normal. • Hypoxia is defined as the reduction of oxygen supply at the tissue level, which is not measured \ndirectly by a laboratory value. Scenario 1: • Generally, the presence of hypoxemia suggests hypoxia i.e. if there is less oxygen in blood, O2 \nsupply to tissues will also be reduced. • But, in case of cyanide poisoning, there is hypoxia in the absence of hypoxemia, i.e., arterial O2 \ncontent is normal but tissues are not able to utilize it because cyanide interferes with aerobic \nmetabolism in the tissues. Scenario 2: • Hypoxia may not be present in patients with hypoxemia if the patient compensates for a low \nPaO2 by increasing oxygen delivery. This is typically achieved by increasing cardiac output (by \nraising the heart rate) or decreasing tissue oxygen consumption. • Nevertheless, hypoxemia is definitely the most common cause of tissue hypoxia, and the correct \ndiagnosis should be made because it is readily treatable.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the case of anemic hypoxia, O2 content is low but dissolved O2 is within normal limits, so it \ndoes not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors. Peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid and aortic arteries sense changes in \nPo2(&lt;60mm Hg), pH, and Pco2 and they respond to changes in dissolved O2(PaO2). Histotoxic hypoxia will lead to metabolic acidosis that will lead to an increase in H+ \nconcentration, which in turn will stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors. Hemorrhage that produces hypotension leads to chemoreceptor stimulation due to decreased \nblood flow to the chemoreceptors and consequent stagnant anoxia of these organs. Note: In case of stagnant hypoxia, chemoreceptors can be stimulated if the resultant decreased \noxygen delivery causes a significant drop in local tissue oxygen levels, which eventually can lower \nthe PaO2 detectable by chemoreceptors. Therefore, they may not be significantly stimulated \nunless the reduction in oxygen levels is severe. Therefore, anaemic hypoxia is a better answer.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Administration of oxygen has maximum benefit in hypoxic hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia refers to a condition in which there is low atmospheric Po2, leading to low \narterial Po2. Hence, supplemental O2 can be very beneficial when the cause of hypoxia is due to \nlimited oxygen availability. Administration of oxygen-rich gas has limited value in anemic, histotoxic, and stagnant hypoxia \nbecause: Anemic hypoxia- Oxygen delivery is not beneficial because despite increasing the exogenous \noxygen delivery, an anemic person will not have the capacity to carry more oxygen due to the \nhemoglobin/ red blood cell deficit in anemia. Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important \nenzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. \nAdditional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, and so it will have \nlimited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent. Stagnant hypoxia- Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate \ncirculation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such \nconditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the \ncirculation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by \nincreasing oxygen administration.",

Option A: With anemia, the hemoglobin is fully saturated and O2 will have minimal effect. \nTreatment of anemia is more beneficial than providing oxygen to an anemic patient. Option B: With COPD there is CO2 retention due to difficulty in the expiration, and there will be a \ndecreased Po2. So, there is a change in the regulation of respiration (drive for ventilation) from \nbeing under CO2 control to being driven by the decrease in O2. Giving supplemental O2 to such a \nperson will increase arterial Po2, thus decrease the stimulus to breathe, resulting in patient \nstopping breathing.

      "explanation": "Oxygen therapy is not beneficial in central respiratory depression. High dose oxygen reduces the output of peripheral chemoreceptors. So, if given to patients who \nalready have central respiratory depression, it will indirectly reduce the hypoxic drive to breathe \neven further, leading to a reduction in respiratory frequency and minute ventilation.

The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced in an anemic person, but the arterial Po2 \nand oxygen saturation are both normal. The decrease in arterial O2 content is compensated for by an increase in the extraction of oxygen \nfrom hemoglobin, which reduces the Po2 of the venous blood. The unloading of oxygen at tissue level is enhanced by an increased level of 2,3-DPG in an anemic \npatient because 2,3-DPG causes a right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. 442 \nSold by @itachibot",

The fetal oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left relative to the adult \ncurve. The fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) has a greater affinity for O2 than adult hemoglobin (Hb A). This \nfacilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to fetus. The cause of this greater affinity is the \npoor binding of 2,3-DPG by ■ polypeptide chains that replace  chains in Hb F. The fetal \noxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is thus shifted to the left relative to the adult curve. \nTypically, fetal arterial Po2 is low, hence leftward shift enhances placental uptake of O2.",

The oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the right when factors like: • Increased temperature resulting from heat generated by the exercising muscle, • Higher carbon dioxide levels released from the muscle tissue, • Elevated 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), and • Increased hydrogen ions concentration in the muscle capillary blood Above factors decrease hemoglobin's oxygen affinity. This shift promotes easier oxygen release to \nmuscles and other tissues. Note: Despite the rightward shift, the maximum hemoglobin oxygen saturation at high oxygen \nlevels remains unchanged. The plateau on the curve represents the maximal saturation achievable \nunder optimal conditions, ensuring hemoglobin can still be fully saturated with oxygen.",

Concept: • Below the sea level, atmospheric pressure increases at the rate of 1 atm for every 33 feet depth. • According to Boyle’s law, as pressure increases, volume decreases. Hence, lungs tend to collapse. \nTo prevent this and to keep lung expanded, gas is delivered at high pressure to the lungs. • According to Dalton’s law, nitrogen contributes the maximum to barometric pressure and hence \nthe amount of nitrogen entering alveoli increases. • Henry’s law: As the partial pressure of nitrogen in alveoli increases, its concentration in blood \nalso increases (dissolved form). Nitrogen is 5 times more soluble in fat compared to water. • As a result, nitrogen dissolves in the fatty substances in neuronal membranes, and because of its \nphysical effect on altering ionic conductance through the membranes, it reduces neuronal \nexcitability and produces the narcotic effect.",

      "explanation": "A shift of Oxygen Haemoglobin Dissociation Curve (OHDC) to the right is seen in acclimatization. On ascension to higher altitudes over a period of days rather than a period of hours, the ability to \nbreathe much more deeply and withstand lower atmospheric O2 concentrations is improved. This \nphenomenon is called acclimatization. Variation of pH in Acclimatization: Immediate exposure to low pO2 stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors. This increases alveolar \nventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows \noff large quantities of CO2, reducing the pCO2 and increases the pH of the body fluids. These changes inhibit the brain stem respiratory center and thereby oppose the effect of low PO2 \nto stimulate respiration through the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic \nbodies. There is a reduction of bicarbonate ion concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in the \nbrain tissues. This reduction, in turn, decreases the pH in the fluids surrounding the \nchemosensitive neurons of the respiratory center, thus increasing the respiratory stimulatory \nactivity of the center. An important mechanism for the gradual decrease in bicarbonate \nconcentration is compensation by the kidneys for the respiratory alkalosis. Gradually, the \nmetabolic compensation of the kidney will shift the pH towards normal. 444 \nSold by @itachibot",
