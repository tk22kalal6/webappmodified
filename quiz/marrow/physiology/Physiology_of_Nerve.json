The unmyelinated \nregions of a myelinated axon are termed as nodes of Ranvier. • Synaptic knobs/nerve endings where action potentials cause the release of synaptic transmitters.

It is a rapid process that allows myelinated axons \nto conduct up to 50 times faster than the fastest unmyelinated fibers. • Activity of the Na+–K+ pump does not directly affect the formation or conduction of action \npotentials.",

      "explanation": "The membrane conductance for potassium is maximum during repolarization (marked as point 3 \nin the above image). Most of the increase in K+ conductance comes after the increase in Na+ conductance around the \ntime of repolarization. During the early portion of the action potential, the sodium conductance is 1000 times greater \nthan potassium conductance. Therefore, far more sodium ions flow to the interior of the fiber than \ndo potassium ions to the exterior. This causes the membrane potential to become positive at the \naction potential onset. When the membrane potential rises from 90 millivolts toward zero, this voltage change causes a \nconformational change in the K+ channels which allows increased potassium efflux. Then, the \nsodium channels begin to close and the potassium channels begin to open, and potassium \nconductance begins to increase (and sodium conductance decreases). The increased flow of K+ out of the cell causes membrane repolarization. The slow return of the \nK+ channels to the closed state explains the after-hyperpolarization followed by a return to the \nresting membrane potential.",

Since the RMP increases, the cell interior becomes less negative. In response to a depolarizing stimulus, some of the voltage-gated Na+ channels open and Na+ \nenters the cell and the membrane is brought to its threshold potential.

The entry of Na+ causes the opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels and \nfurther depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. The rapid upstroke in the membrane \npotential ensues. The membrane potential moves toward the equilibrium potential for Na+ (+60 mV) but does not \nreach it during the action potential, primarily because the increase in Na+ conductance is \nshort-lived. The Na+ channels rapidly enter a closed state called the inactivated state and remain \nin this state for a few milliseconds. In addition, the direction of the electrical gradient for Na+ is reversed during the overshoot \nbecause the membrane potential is reversed, and this limits Na+ influx; also the voltage-gated K+ \nchannels open. These factors contribute to repolarization. The opening of voltage-gated K+ \nchannels is slower and more prolonged than the opening of the Na+ channels. The net movement \nof positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process of \nrepolarization. 109 \nSold by @itachibot The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the after-hyperpolarization, \nfollowed by a return to the resting membrane potential. Thus, voltage-gated K+ channels bring the action potential to an end and cause closure of their \ngates through a negative feedback process.

Chronaxie is the minimum time (duration) for which a stimulus double the strength of rheobase \nhas to be applied for excitation of tissue. Strength-duration curve gives the idea of the excitability of a tissue. Strength-duration relationship arises because the same minimum electrical charge necessary to \nexcite an action potential can come from a current that is either brief but large or prolonged but \nsmall.

      "explanation": "Conduction in the chemical synapses in CNS is always orthodromic. When an action potential is set up in an axon, two impulses travelling in the opposite direction is \nset up by depolarization on either side of the initial current. In the natural situation, impulses pass in one direction only- from synaptic junctions to axon \nterminals. Such conduction is called orthodromic. Conduction in the opposite direction is called \nantidromic. Under natural conditions, impulse conduction is normally only orthodromic. \nAntidromic conduction is usually only seen when a nerve fibre is stimulated under artificial \nconditions. In a chemical synapse, conduction is always orthodromic. As the transmission in a chemical \nsynapse is due to the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic membrane which activate \nreceptors on the postsynaptic membrane, antidromic conduction (i.e. from the postsynaptic \nmembrane to presynaptic membrane) is not possible. Any impulse travelling in such direction \nwould die as it encounters the first synapse. 117 \nSold by @itachibot",

However, the earliest change in Wallerian degeneration after nerve injury is the degeneration of \nthe axon distal to the site of injury (axonal degeneration) where there is a disruption of the \nretrograde and anterograde flow of signals within the axon. Wallerian degeneration • If the axon is cut, the part distal to the cut degenerates; this process is called as Wallerian \ndegeneration. • Orthograde degeneration (Wallerian degeneration) occurs from the point of injury to the nerve \nterminal, interrupting neural transmission. • After the injury, the membrane breaks down and the myelin sheath degenerates. The cell body of \nthe injured neuron swells, the nucleus moves to an eccentric position, and the rough endoplasmic \nreticulum becomes fragmented (chromatolytic reaction). • The nerve then starts to regrow, with multiple small branches projecting along the path the axon \npreviously followed (regenerative sprouting). • When the motor nerve to skeletal muscle is cut and allowed to degenerate, the muscle gradually \nbecomes extremely sensitive to acetylcholine.

      "explanation": "The tetanizing frequency of the muscle, based on the given diagram, is 20 per second. Tetanizing frequency = 1/contraction period. It is the frequency at which individual muscle fibres \ntwitch that fuse and cause sustained muscle contraction, where the contraction period is the time \ntaken from latent period to maximum force of contraction. In this case, the time tracer was taken using a 100Hz tuning fork. Which means the tracer \nrecorded 100 waves per second. Therefore, the duration of each wave in time tracer = 0.01 seconds. In the image given in the question, between the point B (end of latent period) to point C \n(maximum force of contraction), there are about 5 waves. Hence, the duration of contraction = 5 x 0.01 = 0.05 seconds. Substituting the value in the formula, we get: Tetanizing frequency = 1/0.05 sec = 100/5 = 20/sec. Tetanization: The features of muscle contraction can be demonstrated by eliciting single muscle twitches. The \nadding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle \ncontraction is Summation. Summation occurs in two ways: • by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is multiple ■ber \nsummations. • by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead to \ntetanization. When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually \nfuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, 124 \nSold by @itachibot this is called tetanization. Beyond this point, a further increase in the frequency, will not result in \nincreased force of contraction. Tetanization occurs in two ways: • Complete tetanus occurs when no relaxation occurs between stimuli. • Incomplete tetanus when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated \nstimuli. 125 \nSold by @itachibot Muscle Physiology I",
