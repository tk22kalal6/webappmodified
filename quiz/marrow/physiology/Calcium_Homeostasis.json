      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, increased formation of 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol will take place. Infusion of calcium chloride solution will lead to raised calcium concentration in blood. At higher \ncalcium concentrations, PTH is also suppressed. So the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to a \ndifferent compound : 24,25dihydroxycholecalciferol— that has almost no vitamin D effect. When plasma calcium concentration is high, formation of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol is also \ngreatly depressed. Lack of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, in turn, decreases the absorption of \ncalcium from the intestines, bones, and renal tubules, thus causing the calcium ion concentration \nto fall back toward its normal level. Option A: Since PTH levels are supressed bone demineralisation does not take place. Option B: Calcitonin is a calcium regulatory hormone whose level increases when the calcium \nconcentration in plasma is high. Option C: Calcium ions are a part of the coagulation cascade and the blood coaguability either \nincreases or remains the same with high plasma Ca+2 levels.",

When PTH binds to these receptors, osteoblasts \nrelease cytokines like RANK-ligand and M-CSF. These cytokines allow the differentiation of \nmacrophages to osteoclasts. Osteoclasts, in turn, cut the collagen in the bone, which is bound to calcium. This causes the \nrelease of calcium, phosphorus, and collagen breakdown products in the blood. Osteoblasts produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), or osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, a cytokine \nthat inhibits bone resorption by preventing interaction of RANKL with its receptor. PTH \ndecreases the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG). Glucocorticoids promote osteoclast activity and increase bone resorption by increasing RANKL \nproduction and decreasing the formation of OPG.

      "options": {
        "a": "Total calcium concentration is altered by variations in the serum albumin concentration.",
        "b": "Forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized calcium levels",
        "c": "Hemoconcentration due to tourniquet results in a rise of serum calcium",
        "d": "Acidosis causes a decrease in the ionized calcium levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Acidosis does not cause a decrease in the ionized calcium levels. Rather, alkalosis causes a \ndecrease in the ionized calcium levels. Plasma proteins are more ionized when the pH is high (alkalosis), providing more protein anions \nto bind with and sequester free Ca2+. This causes a decrease in ionized calcium and may trigger \nsymptoms of hypocalcemia. Option A: Total calcium concentration is altered by variations in the serum albumin concentration \nas 41% of calcium is bound to plasma proteins like albumin, hence changes in albumin \nconcentration affects the serum calcium levels. The corrected calcium levels can be calculated as: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin [g/dL]), where \n4.0 represents the average albumin level. Option B: Fist-clenching or forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized (free) calcium \nlevels. Option C: A tourniquet is usually avoided while drawing blood for calcium measurements since \nhemoconcentration also leads to an increase in serum calcium levels.",

      "explanation": "Osteoblasts are involved in the initiation and control of osteoclastic activity. Osteoblasts produce receptor activator for nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage \ncolony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which are necessary for formation of mature osteoclasts and \nhence osteoclastic activity. Specific receptors for parathormone are present only on the osteoblasts and not on osteoclasts.",

      "explanation": "Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland, which causes primary \nhyperparathyroidism (not secondary). Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by high levels of parathyroid hormone, to \ncompensate for the low levels of serum calcium, due to some other underlying condition. Causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism, include: • Chronic kidney disease: The damaged kidneys are unable to produce sufficient amounts of the \nactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This further causes hypocalcemia and \ntriggers PTH secretion. • Vitamin D deficiency: Causes hypocalcemia, which triggers the increased secretion of PTH. • Lithium: May cause an increased set-point of calcium for parathyroid hormone suppression, \nwhich leads to parathyroid hyperplasia. 763 \nSold by @itachibot Male Reproductive Physiology",
