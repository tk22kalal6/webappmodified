Enghoff's modification of Bohr equation is: Where, • VD is the physiological dead space • VT is the tidal volume • PaCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in the arterial blood • PeCO2 is the average partial pressure of CO2 in the entire expired air.

      "explanation": "In healthy individuals, anatomical dead space and physiologic dead space are almost equivalent, \nand can be estimated by body weight. Dead space is the volume of the airways and lungs that do not participate in gas exchange. Types • Anatomic dead space- Volume of the air-occupying conducting zone where no exchange of gases \ntakes place. • Alveolar/functional dead space- the volume of gas not equilibrating with blood (wasted \nventilation) • Total dead space/Physiological dead space = Anatomical + Alveolar dead space. In healthy individuals: • Anatomical dead space = 150 mL. • Alveolar dead space is usually zero (increased in diseased conditions). Hence, • Physiological dead space = Anatomical + Alveolar = 150 + 0 = 150 mL. • Physiological dead space = Anatomical dead space. • Radford's formula: Anatomical dead space in mL is approximately equal to the body weight in \npounds. • Dead space can be measured by the following: • Single Breath N2 method (Fowler’s method) • Bohr’s equation",

At the apex (Against gravity): Both ventilation and perfusion decrease since the flow is against gravity. But, a decrease in \nperfusion is higher than the decrease in ventilation. Hence, ratio increases (3.2). At the base of lung: Both ventilation and perfusion increase since the flow is towards gravity. Increase in perfusion is \nmore than increase in ventilation, i.e., denominator increases. Hence, ratio decreases to 0.6. The average value of V/Q ratio throughout lungs is 0.8. Important points: • If the effect of gravity is eliminated, as in the supine position, the value is the same in all parts of \nthe lung = 0.8. • V/Q ratio is infinity when perfusion is zero as in case of pulmonary embolism. • V/Q ratio is zero when ventilation is zero like in case of foreign body obstruction. • High V/Q ratio at apex leads to high pAO2 which favors the growth of microorganisms like \ntubercle bacilli. Intra-pleural pressure decreases as we move from the base to the apex of the lung i.e- becomes \nmore negative as we move from the base to the apex of the lung.",

At first there is no flow because of obstruction at the \ncollapsed venous end of the capillary bed. Pressure from the arterial side builds up until it exceeds \nalveolar pressure and flow resumes. This dissipates the capillary pressure and returns to the start \nof the cycle. The blood flow in this region is determined by the pulmonary artery–alveolar pressure difference. \nBlood “falls” into the pulmonary veins, which are compliant and take whatever amount of blood \ncan flow into them.

Ventilation increases abruptly at the onset of exercise due to psychic stimuli and afferent impulses \nfrom proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. This is followed by a brief pause and then a \ngradual increase in ventilation. This gradual increase in ventilation is believed to be due to \nmultiple factors such as an increase in body temperature, increase in plasma K+ level stimulating \nperipheral chemoreceptors, or the sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2. In strenuous exercise, at a certain point, the O2 uptake reaches its maximum levels, beyond which \nit cannot increase further. This leads to a rise in blood lactate levels. Buffering of lactic acid \nliberates CO2 which further increases ventilation. The increased production of lactic acid, increase \nin ventilation and CO2 production are proportional, and alveolar and arterial CO2 changes little to \nnil.
