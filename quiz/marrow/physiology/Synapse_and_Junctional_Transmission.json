      "explanation": "Impulses are transmitted from one nerve cell to another cell at junctions called synapse. These are \nthe junctions where the axon or some other portion of one cell (the presynaptic cell) terminates on \nthe dendrites, soma, or axon of another neuron or, in some cases, a muscle or gland cell (the \npostsynaptic cell). There are two major types of synapses: • Chemical • Electrical When a neuron terminates on a muscle , it is called a neuromuscular junction . This is an example \nof a chemical synapse . 181 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Chemical synapses are interneuronal junctions without protoplasmic continuity. Most of the synapses used for signal transmission in the central nervous system of the human \nbeing are chemical synapses. In these synapses, the first neuron (presynaptic neuron) secretes neurotransmitters at its nerve \nending synapse. This transmitter, in turn, acts on receptor proteins in the membrane of the next \nneuron (post-synaptic neuron) to excite the neuron, inhibit it, or modify its sensitivity in some \nother way. As neurotransmitters are released only by the pre-synaptic neuron, the synaptic conduction in the \nCNS is only orthodromic (unidirectional). 182 \nSold by @itachibot",

Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane to activate ion channels in \none of the two ways: • by gating ion channels directly (ionotropic receptors). • by activating a second messenger (metabotropic receptor) for a prolonged postsynaptic neuronal \nexcitation or inhibition. Most commonly activated is a G-protein coupled membrane receptor. The following four changes can occur usually after binding to a G-protein coupled receptor: • Opening specific ion channels through the post-synaptic cell membrane. 184 \nSold by @itachibot • Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate \n(cGMP) in the neuronal cell. • Activation of one or more intracellular enzymes. • Activation of gene transcription.

      "question": "Question 21: A 55-year-old woman had an autonomic neuropathy that disrupted the sympathetic nerve \nsupply to the pupillary dilator muscle of her right eye. While having her eyes examined, the \nophthalmologist placed a sympathomimetic drug in both her eyes. The right eye became \nmuch more dilated than the left eye. This suggests that:",
      "options": {
        "a": "The sympathetic nerve to the right eye had regenerated",
        "b": "The parasympathetic nerve supply to the right eye remained intact and compensated for the ",
        "c": "Denervation supersensitivity had developed",
        "d": "The left eye also had nerve damage and so was not responding as expected"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "193 \nSold by @itachibot Denervation supersensitivity develops in the muscle after the nerve supplying it is cut. Since the \nnerve to her right dilator pupillae is damaged, the right eye becomes excessively sensitive to the \nsympathomimetic drug. So, the right eye becomes much more dilated than the left. Denervation Supersensitivity: • When the motor nerve to skeletal muscle is degenerated, the muscle gradually becomes \nextremely sensitive to acetylcholine. This is called denervation hypersensitivity or supersensitivity. • Normally nicotinic receptors are located only in the vicinity of the motor endplate where the \naxon of the motor nerve terminates. When the motor nerve is severed, there is a marked \nproliferation of nicotinic receptors over a wide region of the neuromuscular junction. • Denervation supersensitivity also occurs at autonomic junctions. Smooth muscle, unlike skeletal \nmuscle, does not atrophy when denervated, but it becomes hyperresponsive to the chemical \nmediator that normally activates it. • This hyperresponsiveness can be demonstrated by using pharmacologic tools rather than actual \nnerve section. Prolonged use of a drug such as reserpine can be used to deplete transmitter stores \nand prevent the target organ from being exposed to norepinephrine for an extended period. Once \nthe drug usage is stopped, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle will be supersensitive to subsequent \nrelease of the neurotransmitter. Option a) If the symapthetic nerve would have regenerated, both right and left eye would have \nbeen equally sensitive to the drug and so, would have dilated equally. Option b) Parasympathetic nerves supply the spinchter pupillae muscle. So, if stimulated they \nwould constrict the eye not dilate it. Also, the drug added was a sympathomimetic agent. So, \nparasympathetic nerves are not stimulated in the first place Option d) If the left eye was damaged, it would also have denervation supersensitivity. Again, both \neyes would dilate equally, but more than that of normal.",

      "explanation": "Neurotransmitters should be released on depolarization of the terminal. • Neurotransmitters are the substances that mediate chemical signaling between neurons. • The transmission of information at chemical synapses involves the release of neurotransmitter \nfrom a presynaptic cell, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and binding of the neurotransmitter to \nspecific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane to produce a change in membrane potential. Criteria for the substance to be neurotransmitter • the substance must be demonstrated to be present in the presynaptic terminal • the cell must be able to synthesize the substance. • should be released on depolarization of the terminal. • there should be specific receptors for it on the postsynaptic membrane. • if the substance is applied exogenously to the postsynaptic membrane at physiologic \nconcentration, the response of the postsynaptic cell must mimic the in vivo response 194 \nSold by @itachibot",
