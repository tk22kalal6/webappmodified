The Reticular Activating System (RAS) is a complex polysynaptic pathway arising from the \nbrainstem reticular formation and hypothalamus with projections to the intralaminar and \nreticular nuclei of the thalamus which, in turn, project diffusely and nonspecifically to wide \nregions of the cortex including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices. Collaterals funnel into it from the long ascending sensory tracts, the trigeminal, auditory, visual, \nand olfactory systems. 338 \nSold by @itachibot The reticular formation plays an important role in determining the level of arousal; thus, it is \ncalled the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS).",

      "explanation": "The hypothalamus and several non-specific nuclei in ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) \nlocated in the midbrain are involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Sleep Centres Stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation (RAS) produces the EEG alerting response and \npromotes the waking state. The nucleus coeruleus (locus coeruleus) is rich in norepinephrine and the raphe nuclei of ARAS is \nrich in serotonin. These regions when stimulated induce wakefulness. The cholinergic neurons in the pontine reticular formation, on stimulation, induce sleep. Stimulation of the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus produces arousal. Electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus and the adjacent basal forebrain region \nrapidly induces sleep. This sleep-inducing effect is thought to be mediated by GABA-ergic \ninhibitory neurons.

      "explanation": "From the history, it is clear that the patient is suffering fron anterograde amnesia, most probably \ndue to a lesion is hippocampus. Hippocampus is the primary structure within the temporal lobe involved in conversion of \nshort-term memory to long-term memory. Hippocampal cognitive map is inappropriately reactivated during a deja vu experience. Hippocampus does not store memory but only converts short-term memory to long-term memory. \nHence, hippocampal lesions cause only anterograde amnesia.",

      "explanation": "Retained judgement will be least likely seen if the patient survives such a devastating injury. Injury to the frontal lobe may lead to frontal lobe syndrome, which consists of poor judgment, \nslowed thinking, decreased curiosity, social withdrawal, and irritability. Frontal lobe injury: • Impairs the executive functions: motivation, attention, and sequencing of actions • Aphasia, apraxia, constructional apraxia, neglect, and memory deficits can be seen • Characterized by changes in personality • Apathetic indifference and impulsive behaviour. • Commonly urinary incontinence and faecal incontinence is seen • Commonly produced by trauma, infarcts, tumours, lobotomy, multiple sclerosis, or Pick's \ndisease. Frontal lobe pathology may become apparent only under unstructured, stressful, real-life \nsituations and are difficult to detect in intelligence scales, as IQ mostly requires parietal lobe \nactivation.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "349 \nSold by @itachibot Prosopagnosia is difficulty in identifying known faces. In humans, storage and recognition of faces is more strongly represented in the right inferior \ntemporal lobe in right-handed individuals, though the left lobe is also active. Damage to this area \ncan cause prosopagnosia. Patients with this abnormality can recognize forms and reproduce them. They can recognize \npeople by their voices, and many of them show autonomic responses when they see familiar as \nopposed to unfamiliar faces. However, they cannot identify the familiar faces they see. The left \nhemisphere is also involved, but the role of the right hemisphere is primary. The presence of autonomic response to a familiar face in the absence of recognition has been \nexplained by postulating the existence of a separate dorsal pathway for processing information \nabout faces that leads to recognition at only a subconscious level. Note: • Autotopagnosia - inability to recognize or to orient any part of one's own body • Simultagnosia - inability to recognize multiple elements in a visual presentation, one object or \nsome elements of a scene can be appreciated but not the display as a whole • Somatagnosia - inability to identify any part of the body, either one’s own or another’s body • Tactile agnosia (astereognosis) - inability to recognize objects by touch, in the presence of intact \ncutaneous and proprioceptive hand sensation; caused by a lesion in the contralateral parietal lobe",

      "explanation": "Emotion is regulated by the frontal lobe. There are two aspects of emotion: • Genesis of emotion and rating of emotional importance –from the limbic system – amygdala. • The limbic system houses the emotional association areas, which direct the hypothalamus to \nexpress the motor and endocrine components of the emotional state. • The amygdala rates the emotional importance of an experience and activates the hippocampus \n(memory) accordingly. Thus an emotionally intense experience is etched in memory, which is the \nbasis for learned fear responses. • Damage to the amygdala ablates the ability to distinguish fear and anger in other persons' voices \nand facial expressions. • Regulation of emotion - frontal lobe. 350 \nSold by @itachibot The Limbic System Nppocsmpue 351 \nSold by @itachibot Functional Anatomy",
