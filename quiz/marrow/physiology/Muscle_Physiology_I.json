Excitation contraction coupling refers to the process by which the membrane depolarization of the \nmuscle fibre (excitation) leads to the contraction of the muscle. The steps of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle are as follows: • Motor-neuron discharge causes the release of acetylcholine at the motor endplate, which binds \nto the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. • This causes increased Na+ and K+ conductance in the endplate membrane, leading to the \ngeneration of end-plate potential, which is a local potential. • When the local endplate potential reaches a threshold for the muscle fibre, and an action \npotential is generated. • The generated action potential passes inward through the T tubules, leading to the spread of \ndepolarisation. • The depolarization of the muscle fibre causes the release of Ca2+ from terminal cisterns of \nsarcoplasmic reticulum and diffusion to thick and thin filaments. 158 \nSold by @itachibot • The calcium released, binds to troponin C, uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin. • The formation of cross-linkages between actin and myosin and sliding of thin on thick filaments \ncauses contraction of the skeletal muscle. Steps in relaxation: • The cytoplasmic calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by the action of \nSERCA (sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase). • Once the calcium concentration is lowered, the interaction between actin and myosin ceases, and \nthe muscle relaxes. Other options: Statement 1: Incorrect - Extracellular calcium levels play an important role in muscle contraction. \nWhen there is a decrease in extracellular calcium as in hypocalcemia, the voltage-gated sodium \nchannels are activated, which causes sodium influx. The increased intracellular sodium \nconcentration causes sustained depolarization, which may lead to tetany. Statement 2: Incorrect - Ca2+ is not released from mitochondria. It is released from the \nsarcoplasmic reticulum. Statement 4: Voltage-gated calcium channels on T-tubules (part of sarcolemma) are activated by a \ndepolarizing stimulus, which causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The \nincreased calcium concentration will eventually lead to muscle contraction. 159 \nSold by @itachibot Muscle Physiology II",
