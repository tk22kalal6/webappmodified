      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Principal site of acidification of urine is collecting duct. Acidification occurs in both distal tubule \nand collecting duct, but collecting duct is more important. The urinary pH of 4.5 (limiting pH) is normally reached in the collecting ducts. In the late distal tubules and collecting ducts, the tubular epithelium secretes H+ by primary \nactive transport. Primary active secretion of H+ occurs in type A intercalated cells of the late distal \ntubule and in the collecting tubules. H+ concentration can be increased as much as 900-fold in \nthe collecting tubules.",

Therefore, there is no real “anion gap” in the plasma. However, only certain cations and anions are routinely measured in the clinical laboratory. The \ncation normally measured is Na+, and the anions are usually Cl and HCO3. The “anion gap” (which is only a diagnostic concept) is the difference between unmeasured anions \nand unmeasured cations and is estimated as Plasma anion gap = [Na+ ]  [HCO3 ]  [Cl ]=14424108 =12 mEq/L The anion gap will increase if unmeasured anions rise or if unmeasured cations fall. The most important unmeasured cations include calcium, magnesium and potassium and the \nmajor unmeasured anions are albumin, phosphate, sulfate and other organic anions.

      "explanation": "The acid-base disorder here is a mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. It should not be confused with metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. This \ncan be understood by the following calculation: Step 1: The pH in this patient is 7.1 (pH &lt;7.35) which indicates acidosis 693 \nSold by @itachibot Step 2: HCO3- is 12 mmol/L (Normal HCO3- - 22–30 mmol/L). In metabolic acidosis, \nHCO3- levels decrease. Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis. Step 3: As per Winter's formula, the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can \nbe calculated using, pCO2 =( 1.5 x [HCO3-] ) +8 ± 2 In this case, Expected pCO2 = ( 1.5 x [12] ) +8 ± 2 = 26 ± 2 = 24 - 28 mmHg The pCO2 in this patient is 18 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pCO2. This \novercompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosis \ncontributing to reduced pCO2. Hence, this patient has a mixed disorder - metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.",
