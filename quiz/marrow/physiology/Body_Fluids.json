      "explanation": "Inulin is the indicator used to measure the ECF volume. (Since, inulin can cross blood vessel but \nnot cell wall) Calculation: • Since 10% is excreted, volume of inulin excreted is 1 gm. The amount of inulin diluted in ECF is \n9 g ( 10 - 1) i.e, 9000mg is present in x From the given values, 50 mg is present in 100ml, which can be re-written as 50/100 = 9000/x x = 9000 * 100 / 50 = 9000 * 2 = 18,000mL = 18L Second method : • Since 10% is excreted, volume of inulin excreted is 1 gm. • Amount injected = 10g • Amount excreted = 1g Now, the concentration of inulin after equilibrium is 50 mg/100ml which is equal to 0.05 g/100ml. \n(Convert the values into same units). 82 \nSold by @itachibot Therefore, ECF volume = (10-1)*100/0.05 =18000ml = 18 L",

      "explanation": "As the dye diffuses out of the capillaries, the measured concentration of the dye after equilibrium \nwill be less. So, as per the formula, the volume measured will be falsely high. V = (Amount Injected - Amount Excreted) / Plasma concentration of dye Detailed explanation: • Dye x measures plasma volume:- dye x doesn't have the property of crossing blood vessel. If the \ndye x have been used properly, for a normal person then the value would come around 3 L • Dye y crosses capillaries, which means it can cross any blood vessel. This property is used to \nmeasure the value of ECF. If the dye y is given, for a normal person then the value would come \naround 14L • Thus if dye y is given in place of x, then the value would be 14 instead of 3 which is a false and \nthe obtained value is high when compared to normal value • Therefore the answer is falsely high. 83 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "88 \nSold by @itachibot Calculated serum osmolality = 2 sodium + (glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8). In the given clinical scenario, the patient with untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus has most likely \ndeveloped a hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic state. His serum osmolality will be significantly raised. The principal determinants of osmolality of serum are the concentrations of sodium, glucose and \nurea (blood urea nitrogen or BUN). Osmolality is defined as a measure of the osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram of solvent \n(osmol/kg or Osm/kg). The osmolality of the intracellular and extracellular fluids is maintained \nbetween 290 and 310 mOsm in each compartment.",

      "explanation": "The images shown in the figure are called Darrow Yannet Diagrams. They depict the change in \nplasma osmolality and plasma volume in various conditions. If a hypertonic solution is added to the extracellular fluid, the extracellular osmolarity increases \nand causes osmosis of water out of the cells into the extracellular compartment • ECF osmolality increases. ECF volume increases. • As, ECF osmolality rises, fluid from ICF moves to ECF till osmotic equilibrium is established. So, • ICF osmolality rises. ICF volume decreases. Therefore, the net effect is an increase in extracellular volume (greater than the volume of fluid \nadded), a decrease in intracellular volume, and a rise in osmolarity in both compartments. Note : The dotted line in the diagram is the change after either addition or removal of fluid",

Aldosterone deficiency leads to \nincreased sodium loss (loss of hyperosmotic fluid). • The osmolarity of ECF decreases. • ECF volume decreases because of the loss of volume. • Water shifts into ICF; as a result of the shift, ICF osmolarity decreases until it is equal to ECF \nosmolarity, and ICF volume increases. • So, loss of hypertonic fluid causes hypotonic volume contraction.
