      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The windkessel effect is seen in large elastic vessels. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, and their major branches have a large amount of elastin in their \nwalls. Hence, they have a high elastic recoil effect. This property of elastic recoil is called \nwindkessel effect (windkessel is a German word for the elastic reservoir). This recoil of the vessels that have been stretched during systole helps to propel the blood forward \nduring diastole thus maintaining a continuous flow throughout the cardiac cycle.",

Since the lymph is derived from interstitial fluid, any factor that increases interstitial fluid \npressure also increases lymph flow provided, the lymph vessels are functioning normally. The \nfactors which increase interstitial fluid pressure include: • Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure • Increased interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure • Increased permeability of the capillaries • Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure All of the above factors increase the filtration at the capillary-interstitium interface and therefore \nincrease the interstitial fluid volume and pressure.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Factor 2 would have decreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in a patient on warfarin therapy. Activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X is done by carboxylation of their glutamate \nresidues. This is done by the enzyme -glutamyl carboxylase with the reduced form of vitamin K \nas a co-factor. This reduced form of vitamin K needs to be constantly recycled back from its oxidized form for the \nreaction to continue. This recycling is done by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This \nenzyme is inhibited by warfarin. Hence, warfarin indirectly inhibits the -carboxylation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors \n- Factors II, VII, IX, X by directly inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase. Thus leading to \ndecreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in these factors. 481 \nSold by @itachibot",
