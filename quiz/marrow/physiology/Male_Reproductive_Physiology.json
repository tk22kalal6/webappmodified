      "explanation": "The decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin will have the maximum effect on testosterone. Around 98% of the circulating testosterone is bound to plasma proteins such as sex \nhormone-binding globulin (65%) and albumin. So, the decrease in sex-hormone-binding globulin \n(SHBG) or gonadal steroid-binding globulin (GBG) will have the maximum effect on testosterone \nlevels by increasing the levels of its free form. Therefore patients with polycystic ovary syndrome will show features of hyperandrogenism (due \nto elevated free testosterone).",

Spermiogenesis is a process by which there is a formation of extremely specialized mobile \nspermatozoa from spermatids. This process requires extensive remodeling or packaging of cell \nelements. It occurs in the recesses formed by invaginations of the sertoli cell plasma membrane. Maturation from spermatids to spermatozoa depends on androgen acting on sertoli cells. When \nsperm maturation is complete, the cytoplasm of the sertoli cell around sperm retracts and sperms \nare released into the lumen to be bathed by the luminal fluid. The following changes occur during the formation ofspermatozoafrom spermatids : • The nucleus becomes eccentric and decreases in size, and the chromatin becomes condensed. • The cytoplasmic content is redistributed and discarded. 775 \nSold by @itachibot • The acrosome buds from the golgi apparatus. • The centrioles migrate to the caudal pole and form a long axial filament made of microtubules. \nThis becomes the axoneme or major portion of the tail.

      "explanation": "Sperm motility is increased by vaginal secretions. On coming in contact with the fluids of the female genital tract, multiple changes occur that \nactivate the sperm for the final processes of fertilization. These collective changes are called \ncapacitation of the spermatozoa, which normally requires from 1 to 10 hours. The following changes are believed to occur: • The uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppress \nsperm activity in the male genital ducts. • While the spermatozoa remain in the fluid of the male genital ducts, they are continually \nexposed to many floating vesicles from the seminiferous tubules containing large amounts of \ncholesterol. This cholesterol is continually added to the cellular membrane covering the sperm \nacrosome, toughening this membrane and preventing the release of its enzymes. • After ejaculation, the sperm deposited in the vagina swim away from the cholesterol vesicles \nupward into the uterine cavity, and they gradually lose much of their other excess cholesterol \nduring the next few hours. In doing so, the membrane at the head of the sperm (the acrosome) \nbecomes much weaker. • The membrane of the sperm also becomes much more permeable to calcium ions, so calcium \nnow enters the sperm in abundance and changes the activity of the flagellum, giving it a powerful \nwhiplash motion in contrast to its previously weak undulating motion. In addition, the calcium \nions cause changes in the cellular membrane that cover the leading edge of the acrosome, making \nit possible for the acrosome to release its enzymes rapidly and easily as the sperm penetrates the \ngranulosa cell mass surrounding the ovum, and even more so as it attempts to penetrate the zona \npellucida of the ovum. 779 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "After ejaculation, sperms have a maximal lifespan of 24-48 hours in the female genital tract. The activity and rate of metabolism of sperm increase markedly with increasing temperature \ncausing its life to be considerably shortened. Sperm can be cryopreserved for years if agents such as glycerol are used to prevent ice crystal \nformation during freezing. Note: The ovum remains viable and capable of being fertilized, probably no longer than 24 hours \nafter it is expelled from the ovary.",

      "explanation": "The hormone that plays a permissive role in the attainment of puberty is leptin. It now appears that leptin may be the link between body weight and puberty. Leptin is a \nsatiety-producing hormone secreted by adipocytes. High leptin levels reduce appetite and increase \nenergy expenditure. Evidence for which is given by: • Obese ob/ob mice that cannot make leptin are infertile, and their fertility is restored by \ninjections of leptin. • Leptin treatment also induces precocious puberty in immature female mice. • However, the way that leptin fits into the overall control of puberty remains to be determined. Leptin also accelerates GnRH pulsatility in neurons, fastening puberty. 782 \nSold by @itachibot Female Reproductive Physiology",
