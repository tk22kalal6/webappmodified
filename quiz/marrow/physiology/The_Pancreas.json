In 1921, Banting took his idea to Professor John Macleod at the University of Toronto, who was a \nleading figure in the study of diabetes in Canada. Macleod gave Banting a laboratory with a \nminimum equipments and ten dogs. Banting also got an assistant, a medical student by the name \nof Charles Best. In 1923, the Nobel Committee decided to award Banting and Macleod the Nobel Prize in \nPhysiology or Medicine. The decision of the Nobel Committee made Banting furious.

Insulin abuse is a method for increasing muscle bulk and performance enhancement in athletes, \nalthough less common than anabolic steroid abuse. Exogenous insulin does not contain C-peptide. \nTherefore blood level of C-peptide will be low in such patients. On the other hand, endogenous \nproduction of insulin will be characterized by high C-peptide level in blood. Insulin is composed of two chains A and B, and a connecting peptide called C peptide. The insulin \nand C peptide are packaged in the secretory granules and secreted in equimolar amounts. Importance of C-peptide: • C peptide is measured by radioimmunoassay, and its level in the blood provides an index of \nbeta-cell function in patients receiving exogenous insulin. If they are unable to produce insulin, \nthey have greatly decreased levels of C peptide. • C peptide levels can be used to differentiate between an insulinoma (high C-peptide) and \nexogenous insulin overdose (low C-peptide) in a patient with hypoglycemia.",

This ATP closes \nATP sensitive potassium channels, leading to a rise in K+ and depolarization. This in turn causes \nthe opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels and influx of Ca+. This ultimately leads to the \nsecretion of insulin via exocytosis. Diazoxide keeps the ATP sensitive K+ channels open and prevents depolarization, resulting in a \ndecreased insulin release. It is used in patients with insulinoma. Sulfonylureas cause closure of the ATP sensitive K+ channels, leading to increased insulin \nsecretion. It is used in patients with diabetes mellitus.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Diazoxide acts by opening ATP sensitive K+ channels and causing a decrease in insulin secretion. Glucose enters beta cells of the pancreas via GLUT-2 receptors. Once inside, it is phosphorylated \nby glucokinase (rate-limiting step) to glucose-6-phosphate which is oxidized to form adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP). This ATP causes closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and hence \ndepolarization. This leads to opening voltage-gated calcium channels and Ca2+ influx. This \nstimulates fusion of the insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane and secretion of \ninsulin into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis. Diazoxide keeps the ATP sensitive K+ channels open and prevents depolarization and subsequent \ninsulin release. Sulfonylureas cause closure of the ATP sensitive K+ channels, leading to increased insulin \nsecretion. 726 \nSold by @itachibot",
