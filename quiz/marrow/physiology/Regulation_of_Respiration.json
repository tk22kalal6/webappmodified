These \nactivate motor neurons via cervical (Phrenic nerve innervating diaphragm) and thoracic spinal \ncord (external intercostal muscle). There is a reciprocal innervation to expiratory and inspiratory muscles in that motor neurons \nsupplying expiratory muscles are inactive when motor neurons supplying inspiratory muscles are \nactive, and vice versa.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Depth of inspiration is increased by the apneustic center. The apneustic centre sends signals to prevent switching off of inspiration maintained by the \ndorsal respiratory group of neurons, thereby increasing depth of inspiration. In contrast to this, the pneumotaxic center primarily limits inspiration by controlling the \"switch \noff\" point of the inspiratory ramp signal. A note on inspiratory ramp signal: The neural signals transmitted to the inspiratory muscle, mainly the diaphragm, is not the \ninstantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a \nramped manner. The advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the \nlungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps. Control of the limiting point at which the ramp suddenly ceases is the mechanism by which the \nrespiratory centers control depth and rate of respiration. Option A: Pneumotaxic center of the pons regulates the rate and depth of breathing. Option B: Ventral group of neurons regulate expiration. Option C: Dorsal group of neurons regulate inspiration. 457 \nSold by @itachibot",

Unlike the dorsal \nrespiratory group (DRG; dorsal group of neurons), VRG (the ventral group of neurons) does not \nappear to participate in the basic rhythmic oscillations that control respiration. • Extra-respiratory drive (overdrive mechanism): When the respiratory drive for increased \npulmonary ventilation becomes greater than normal, for example, during exercise, respiratory \nsignals spill over to VRG from DRG. So, VRG contributes to the extra respiratory drive (overdrive \nmechanism). • The neurons of VRG contribute to both inspiration and expiration; especially, they are important \nin providing powerful expiratory signals to the abdominal muscles during very heavy expiration.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Peripheral chemoreceptors respond minimally to changes in PO2 under normoxic conditions. Because of the enormous blood flow per unit of tissue to the carotid bodies, the receptors are not \nstimulated in conditions such as anemia or carbon monoxide poisoning, in which the amount of 459 \nSold by @itachibot dissolved O2 in the blood reaching the receptors is generally normal, even though the combined \nO2 in the blood is markedly decreased. Peripheral chemoreceptors are responsive to changes in arterial O2, CO2, and H+ ions. They are excited by a decrease in arterial O2. However, a graph plotted between the rate of firing \nof afferent neurons in the chemoreceptor vs. arterial pO2 shows they are most sensitive to \nchanges in pO2 of less than 60mmHg. Thus, ventilation is driven by pCO2 and H+ under \nnormoxic conditions. Other options : • Option B: Peripheral chemoreceptors respond to changes in blood pH. They are excited by an \nincrease in H+ ions (i.e decrease in pH) • Option C: The response of peripheral chemoreceptors to changes in Pco2 is faster than that of \ncentral chemoreceptors. Increase in arterial pCO2 stimulates respiration. However, the \nstimulation by way of peripheral chemoreceptors occurs 5 times as rapidly as that from central \nchemoreceptors. This helps increase the rapididty of response to CO2 at the onset of exercise. • Option D: Central chemoreceptors are more important than the peripheral chemoreceptors in \nthe ventilatory response to increased CO2.

Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: \"Prolonged inspiration inhibits further inspiration\" • Hyperinflation of lungs stimulates slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors and the impulses \ntravel in the vagus nerve via large myelinated fibers. • This signal inhibits the inspiratory ramp signals of the dorsal respiratory group of neurons \n(DRG), thus, inspiration is quickly inhibited and expiration follows. • Advantages of Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: It cuts down the inspiration time, and therefore, • It prevents overinflation of the lungs. • Lungs operate at lower lung volumes, thereby preventing wastage of energy. • The Hering-Breuer reflex is activated when the lung volume increases to more than three times \nthe normal tidal volume (tidal volume = 0.5 liters/breath; So, lung volume &gt; 1.5 liters per breath \nactivates the reflex). • It signifies that the reflex plays a protective role preventing the overinflation of the lung rather \nthan regulating the normal ventilation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Moderate exercise does not reduce the arterial Po2, increase the arterial Pco2, or reduce the \narterial pH. Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to \ntransmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. \nThis action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during \nexercise that causes a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure. Option B: The Po2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that \nare stimulated as a result. Option C: Two points are important regarding pH during moderate exercise: • pH = pK+ log ([HCO3-)/ [CO2]) • The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of \nHCO3-. The concentrations of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2) are very large compared \nto the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- \ndue to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise is very tiny compared to the amount of HCO3- \nalready present in the blood. Thus, the pH of blood during moderate exercise remains constant. • When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic \nacid, which initially leads to an increase in PaCO2. However, this is counteracted by the \nstimulation of ventilation and as a result, PaCO2 is decreased. This provides some respiratory \ncompensation for further lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood \npH remains constant in moderate exercise. 465 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In moderate exercise, the respiratory rate is increased at the beginning due to the response of \njoint proprioceptor stimulation. Respiratory responses to exercise • During exercise, there is an increase in ventilatory rate that matches the increase in O2 \nconsumption and CO2 production by the body. The stimulus for increased ventilation rate is the \nactivation of joint proprioceptors at the beginning of the exercise. • The mean values for arterial Po2 and Pco2 do not change during exercise. Arterial pH does not \nchange during moderate exercise, although it may decrease during strenuous exercise because of \nlactic acidosis. • On the other hand, venous Pco2 increases during exercise because the excess CO2 produced by \nexercising muscle is carried to the lungs in venous blood. • Pulmonary blood flow increases because cardiac output increases during exercise. As a result, \nmore pulmonary capillaries are perfused, and more gas exchange occurs. The distribution of V/Q \nratios throughout the lung is more even during exercise than when at rest, and there is a resulting \ndecrease in the physiologic dead space. The abrupt increase at the start of exercise is presumably due to • Psychic stimuli • Afferent impulses from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. The more gradual increase in ventilation is presumably due to • Increase in O2 consumption (Proportional increase) • Increase in body temperature • Increases in the plasma K+ level (Stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors). • Sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2 is increased or that the respiratory \nfluctuations in arterial PCO2 increase so that, even though the mean arterial PCO2 does not rise, \nit is CO2 that is responsible for the increase in ventilation. 466 \nSold by @itachibot",
