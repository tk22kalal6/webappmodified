      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Thyroxine crosses the plasma membrane for its action. Thyroid hormones enter the nucleus and bind to thyroid hormone receptors. The \nhormone-receptor complex in the nucleus binds to DNA via zinc fingers. This increases the \nexpression of a variety of different genes that code for proteins regulating cell function. Although \nthyroxine is an AA derivative, there are transporters to move it into the cell, hence they are \nintracellular receptors acting on the nucleus. Epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin bind to cell surface receptors.",

      "explanation": "26 \nSold by @itachibot Cortisol is not stored before release. Usually, the polypeptide and protein hormones such as insulin, thyroxine or renin are stored in \nsecretory vesicles before release. They are synthesized as much larger polypeptide chains \n(preprohormones) that are biologically inactive and then processed intracellularly by specific \nproteases to yield the final hormone molecule which is stored in the secretory vesicle until needed. On the other hand, steroid hormones such as cortisol are synthesised as needed and are not \nstored. They are lipid soluble and easily diffuse across cell membrane to enter the interstitial fluid \nand then blood.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Downregulation of receptors occurs due to internalisation, inactivation of receptors or \ndesensitisation. A decrease in the level of stimulating hormones generally leads to an increase in the level of active \nreceptors. This is called upregulation of receptors. On the other hand, an increase in the level of stimulating hormones generally leads to a decrease \nin the level of active receptors. This is called downregulation of receptors. Downregulation of receptors can occur by one of the following mechanisms: • Desensitisation - Receptors undergo chemical modifications that make them less responsive. • Internalisation - It is the temporary sequestration of the cell membrane receptors to the inside of \nthe cell, away from the action of hormones. Following internalisation, the receptors are either \ndestroyed or recycled. • Inactivation of receptors. • Decreased production of receptors.",

Receptors for neurotransmitters are classified into two broad families based on structure and \nfunction. They are: • Ligand-gated channels (Ionotropic receptors) • When bound to these receptors, a membrane channel is opened leading to a brief increase in \nionic conductance. • Important for fast synaptic transmission. • Examples - GABAA, GABAC, Nicotinic cholinergic, Glycine and Serotonin (5HT3 subtype). • G-protein coupled receptors (Metabotropic receptors) 27 \nSold by @itachibot • When bound to these receptors, secondary messengers are released that modulate voltage-gated \nchannels on neuronal membranes. • Examples - GABAB, Muscarinic cholinergic, Catecholamines, Serotonin (all subtypes except \n5HT3) and opioid receptors.",

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell membrane receptors that span across the membrane \n7 times hence called seven helix or serpentine receptors. G proteins have 3 subunits ( , and ■).

The  subunit dissociates and in turn alters the activity of second messengers such \nas cAMP, cGMP or Ca2+. Once the ligand is unbound, the intrinsic GTPase activity of the  subunit converts GTP to GDP. \nThis leads to reassociation of  with the -■ subunit and termination of effector activation. 28 \nSold by @itachibot",
