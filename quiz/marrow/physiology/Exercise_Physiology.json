      "explanation": "Slow-twitch fibres, which are adapted for endurance running, are not larger in diameter than \nfast-twitch fibres. Fast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with \nslow-twitch fibres. Fast-Twitch and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers • Fast-twitch fibres can deliver extreme amounts of power from a few seconds to a minute. • The enzymes that promote rapid release of energy from the phosphagen and glycogen–lactic acid \nenergy systems are more active in fast-twitch fibres. • Fast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with slow-twitch fibres. • Gastrocnemius muscle has a higher preponderance of fast-twitch fibres, which gives it the \ncapability of forceful and rapid contraction of the type used in jumping. • Slow-twitch fibres are mainly organized for endurance, especially for the generation of aerobic \nenergy. • They have far more mitochondria than do the fast-twitch fibres. • They contain considerably more myoglobin. The extra myoglobin increases the rate of diffusion \nof oxygen throughout the fibre. • The enzymes of the aerobic metabolic system are considerably more active in slow-twitch fibres. • The number of capillaries is greater in the vicinity of slow-twitch fibres. • Soleus muscle has a higher preponderance of slow-twitch muscle fibres and therefore is used to a \ngreater extent for prolonged lower leg muscle activity.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Signals from joint proprioceptors play a role in stimulating the respiratory drive during exercise. Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Smoking causes no change to the sensitivity of the chemoreceptors. Effect of Smoking on Pulmonary Ventilation in Exercise • Nicotine causes constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which increases the \nresistance of air flow into and out of the lungs. • The irritating effects of the smoke causes increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree and \nsome degree of swelling of the epithelial linings, which again increases airflow resistance. • Nicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

      "explanation": "Exercise causes an increase in body temperature. Almost all the energy released by the body’s metabolism of nutrients is eventually converted into \nbody heat.
