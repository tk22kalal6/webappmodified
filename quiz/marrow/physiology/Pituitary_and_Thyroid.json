      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "ACTH is more responsible than MSH for the hyperpigmentation seen in a patient with Cushing \nsyndrome due to pituitary cause (ACTH hypersecretion). ACTH is a derivative of POMC (Pro-opiomelanocortin). POMC is the precursor of ACTH, \nmelanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH),  lipotropin and  endorphin. Since the \nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone is the byproduct of ACTH synthesis from POMC, any disease \nprocess which leads to ACTH overproduction will also lead to an increased level of MSH. ACTH \nhas mild MSH activity, hence elevated levels of ACTH acts on melanotropin-1 receptors causing \ngeneralized hyperpigmentation. A similar manifestation will also be seen in Addison's disease where the ACTH level is high.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The secretion of prolactin is increased after the sectioning of the pituitary stalk. Prolactin is unique among the pituitary hormones because the predominant central control \nmechanism is inhibitory, i.e., dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. Hence, sectioning of the \npituitary stalk (Ex: In head trauma or compressive skull lesions) prevents this inhibition and leads \nto increased secretion of prolactin. Note: If the pituitary stalk is cut above the pituitary gland but the entire hypothalamus is left intact, the \nposterior pituitary hormones (ADH &amp; Oxytocin) show a transient decrease because they are \ninitially synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and are \nthen transported down to the nerve endings to the posterior pituitary gland, requiring several \ndays to reach the gland.",

Note: The pygmies of Africa have a congenital inability to synthesize significant amounts of \nsomatomedin C (IGF-I). Therefore, even though their plasma concentration of growth hormone is \neither normal or high, they have diminished amounts of IGF-I in the plasma, which accounts for \nthe short stature.

      "explanation": "Iodide trapping (iodide uptake) is not catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. Oxidation, organification, \nand coupling are catalyzed by it. Steps in synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone: • Iodide uptake: The basolateral sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) actively takes up I-(iodide) from \nthe circulation into the follicular cells. It is then transported into the colloid through a pendrin \n(chloride-iodide) transporter 706 \nSold by @itachibot • Thyroglobulin synthesis: Thyroglobulin (Tg), is a large glycoprotein rich in tyrosine residues. It is \nsynthesized by follicular cells. • Iodination of thyroglobulin: This is regulated by the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme. TPO has \nthree functions: • Oxidation: TPO oxidizes I- to I2 (iodine) in the presence of H2O2 • Organification: TPO links tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin with iodine (I2) to form \nmonoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT) • Coupling reactions: TPO combines iodinated tyrosine residues to make MIT + DIT = T3 \n(triiodothyronine), DIT + DIT = T4 (tetraiodothyronine) • Storage: Thyroid hormones are bound to thyroglobulin and stored in the follicular lumen as \ncolloids. The colloid has hormone reserves for 2-3 months • Release: Iodinated thyroglobulin is taken up by the thyroid follicles via endocytosis and fuses \nwith lysosomes. It is cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4. T4 \n(80%) and T3 (20%) are released into the blood • Peripheral T3 conversion: T4 undergoes deiodination in extrathyroidal tissue to form T3, which \nis the active form of the hormone",
