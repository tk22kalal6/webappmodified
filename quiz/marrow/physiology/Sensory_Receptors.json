Exteroceptors are concerned with the external environment or receptors which receives external \nstimuli. Mechanoreceptors are cutaneous receptors for touch and pressure.

Interoceptors are concerned with the internal environment. Chemoreceptors are receptors stimulated by a change in the chemical composition of the \nenvironment in which they are located. These include receptors for taste and smell as well as \nvisceral receptors such as those sensitive to changes in the plasma level of O2, pH, and osmolality. Teleceptors (distance receivers) are concerned with events at a distance, example - \nphotoreceptors.

Option B: A touch receptor will not generate a constant rate of discharge, even if the receptor is \ncontinuously stimulated. This is called desensitization or adaptation.

Gate control theory operates at the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 222 \nSold by @itachibot The relief may result from inhibition of pain pathways (Inhibition of C fibers and A-delta fibers) in \nthe dorsal horn gate, by stimulation of large-diameter touch-pressure afferents(A-beta fibers). This \nis called the gate-control hypothesis. Interesting clinical application: Touching or shaking an injured area decreases the pain due to the \ninjury. Stimulation with an electric vibrator at the site of pain also gives some relief. The same mechanism is probably responsible for the efficacy of counterirritants.
