Retina is organized into 10 layers or zones where distinctive components are clustered together to \nform continuous strata. • Light passes in the direction: Vitreous humor(anterior) choroid(most posterior) encountering \nthe cell layers in that direction (ganglion cell layerphotoreceptors) • Visual processing/Phototransduction occurs in the opposite direction (Photoreceptors ganglion \ncell layer)",

It is nearly maximal in about 20 min, much \nlonger than the time taken for light adaptation which is 5 min. • When one passes suddenly from a dim to a brightly lighted environment, the light seems \nintensely and even uncomfortably bright until the eyes adapt to the increased illumination and the \nvisual threshold rises.
