      "explanation": "The principle that in the spinal cord the dorsal roots are sensory and the ventral roots are motor is \nknown as the Bell–Magendie law. Laws in Sensory Physiology • Muller's doctrine of specific nerve energies: When the nerve pathways from a particular sense \norgan are stimulated, the sensation evoked is that for which the receptor is specialized, no matter \nhow or where along the pathway the activity is initiated. 231 \nSold by @itachibot • Law of projection: No matter where a particular sensory pathway is stimulated along its course \nto the cortex, the conscious sensation produced is referred to the location of the receptor. • Weber-Fechner Law: Magnitude of sensation felt is directly proportional to the log of the \nintensity of the stimulus. • Labelled line theory: All the sensations from the different parts of the body travel along specified \npaths. For example, in the posterior column, fibers from the lower parts of the body are placed \nmedially.",

The question tests your knowledge of this pathway. It is said that the signal reaches the thalamus \nand the postcentral gyrus is intact.
