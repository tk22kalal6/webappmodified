      "explanation": "The intrapleural pressure is negative both during inspiration and expiration because the thoracic \ncage and lung recoil in opposite direction. The 2 factors that lead to a negative or subatmospheric intrapleural pressure are: • The lungs, with their elastic properties, tend to collapse, and the chest wall, with its elastic \nproperties, tends to spring out. When these two opposing forces pull on the intrapleural space, a \nnegative pressure, or vacuum, is created. • The continuous suction of excess fluid into the lymphatic channels. Applied aspect: In cases of pneumothorax, intrapleural pressure suddenly becomes equal to atmospheric pressure. \nThus instead of its normal negative value, intrapleural pressure becomes zero. Hence lungs \ncollapse and the chest wall spring out.",

      "explanation": "At the end of inspiration, the alveolar pressure is zero with reference to the atmospheric pressure. Whenever alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, alveolar pressure is said to be zero. This \nhappens when no air is moving in or out of the lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, causing the volume of the thorax to increase. As lung \nvolume increases, the pressure in the lungs must decrease. (Boyle’s law states that P × V is \nconstant at a given temperature.) Halfway through inspiration, the alveolar pressure falls below \natmospheric pressure (1 cm H2O). The pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveoli \ndrives airflow into the lung. Air flows into the lungs until, at the end of inspiration, alveolar \npressure is once again equal to the atmospheric pressure; the pressure gradient between the \natmosphere and the alveoli has dissipated, and airflow into the lungs ceases.

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "The transpulmonary pressure would be 12 cmH2O when she inhales 600mL of air. Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) is the difference between alveolar pressure (Palv) and intrapleural \npressure (Pip). It is given by the formula: Ptp = Palv-Pip. Inspiration causes a negative change in \nboth the Palv and Pip. Lung compliance is the extent to which the lungs will expand for each unit \nincrease in transpulmonary pressure. In a normal adult, the pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O of both lungs \ntogether. Hence, expanding the lungs by 200 mL of inspired air will require an increase in Ptp by \n1 cm H2O. Given: Pulmonary compliance = 0.2 L/cm H2O = 200 ml/cm H20 Alveolar pressure at the beginning of inspiration = 4 cmH2O Intrapleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration = -5 cmH2O Volume of air inhaled = 600mL (0.6L) Step 1: Calculate the initial transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - Intrapleural pressure; Initial transpulmonary \npressure = 4 cmH2O - (-5 cmH2O) = 9 cmH2O Step 2: ˜se the lung compliance formula to find the change in transpulmonary pressure. Lung compliance = Change in volume / Change in transpulmonary pressure. Pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O. Hence, to expand the lungs by 200 \nmL of inspired air, it will require an increase in Ptp by 1 cm H2O. So, for 600 ml inspired air, the \ncompliance is = 600 mL / 200 mL/cm H2O = 3 cmH2O Step 3: Calculate the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) after inhaling 600mL of air. During inspiration, the alveolar pressure (Palv) decreases, and the intrapleural pressure (Pip) \nbecomes more negative. Final transpulmonary pressure = Initial transpulmonary pressure + change in transpulmonary \npressure; Final transpulmonary pressure = 9 cmH2O + 3 cmH2O = 12 cmH2O. 375 \nSold by @itachibot",

In a gas-filled lung, surface tension and elastic recoil \nforces act to collapse the lung and thus reduce compliance. • When the lungs are filled with air, there is an interface between the alveolar fluid and the air in \nthe alveoli; so, there is surface tension. • But, in the case of the saline solution-filled lungs, there is no air–fluid interface and there is \nno surface tension, making it more compliant. • Hence, the pressure–volume curve obtained with saline measures only the tissue elasticity. • The difference in the curves generated during inflation and deflation, termed hysteresis, is not \npresent in the saline-generated curves.",
