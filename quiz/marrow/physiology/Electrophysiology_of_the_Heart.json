      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Phase 0 of pacemaker potential is initiated by opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The pacemaker potential consists of: • Phase 0 - this is upstroke seen due to the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This causes an \ninflux of calcium leading to the upstroke. • Phase 3 - This is followed by inactivation of the calcium channels and simultaneous activation of \nK+ channels. This leads to efflux of K+ bringing about repolarization. • Phase 4- As the K+ efflux declines, a channel permeable to both Na+ and K+ opens leading to an \ninflux of both Na+ and K+. This is the If channel. This is responsible for slow spontaneous \ndiastolic depolarization. This accounts for the automaticity of SA and AV node. The slope of Phase 4 in the SA node determines the heart rate. Note: Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels seen in myocyte potential are permanently inactivated \nbecause of the less negative resting potential of the pacemaker cells. 529 \nSold by @itachibot",
