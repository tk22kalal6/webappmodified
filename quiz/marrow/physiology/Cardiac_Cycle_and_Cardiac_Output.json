      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The correct sequence of events that occur after the p-wave is 1-2-4-3, ie:- a wave in JVP  First heart sound  T wave in ECG  Rapid filling of ventricles. The sequence of the events in this question can be better understood with the following diagram: • The p wave in the ECG represents atrial depolarization, which causes contraction of the atria, \nrepresented by the 'a' wave in the JVP. Atrial contraction causes final filling of the ventricles \n(fourth phase of ventricular diastole) 517 \nSold by @itachibot • Atrial contraction is followed by the closure of the mitral valve, which causes the first-heart \nsound. • This is followed by the isovolumetric contraction of the ventricle, which causes c wave in JVP, \ndue to bulging of the tricuspid valve. This is followed by the rapid ejection phase of the ventricle. • The T wave of ECG occurs during ventricular repolarization, which is followed by the opening of \nthe mitral valve, followed by rapid filling phase of the ventricle (second phase of ventricular \ndiastole). ’ote: Passive rapid filling occurs as the mitral valve opens just before atrial contraction occurs.",
