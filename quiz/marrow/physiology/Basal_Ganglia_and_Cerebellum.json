      "explanation": "The striatum receives the afferent input. Note: There are two main inputs to the basal ganglia: From the cerebral cortex (corticostriate pathway) \nand from the thalamus (thalamostriate pathway). They are both excitatory (glutamate) and they \nboth terminate in the striatum. The two major outputs of the basal ganglia are from GPi and substantia nigra. Both are inhibitory \n(GABAergic) and both project to the thalamus. From the thalamus, there is an excitatory (glutamatergic) projection to the prefrontal and \npremotor cortex. This completes the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop. 313 \nSold by @itachibot",
