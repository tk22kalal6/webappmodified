The tracheobronchial tree is divided into multiple generations based on Weibel’s lung model. It \nbegins at the trachea (designated as zero) and ends with alveoli (last generation). There are 2 \nzones: • Conducting zone • Consists of the first 16 generations • Incapable of gas exchange • Respiratory zone • Consists of the last 7 generations (17-23) • Capable of gas exchange Terminal bronchiole is the transition point between the conducting and respiratory zone.",

        "c": "Respiratory bronchioles",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, bronchi (medium-sized airway) offer maximum resistance. The best answer here is bronchi, as all the other options suggest smaller airways, while bronchi \nare the only medium-sized airway. Airflow can be derived from Poiseuille-Hagen formula: Q = Pr4/8L Where • Q is the flow rate •  is pie symbol • P is the pressure difference 356 \nSold by @itachibot • r is radius •  is viscosity • L is length Also, Flow rate (Q) = pressure difference (P)/ resistance (R). Therefore, substituting this in Poiseuille- Hagen formula, P/ R =  Pr4/8l 1/R =  r4/8l R = 8l/  r4 Therefore it can be derived that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius by \nthe power of four. With Poiseuille- Hagen formula we might feel that the smallest airways are the major site of \nresistance. However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total \nresistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in parallel rather than in \nseries. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (Total cross-sectional \ndiameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is \nvery small. Also, airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area \nincreases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar). Other factors affecting airway resistance : • Lung volume, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume \nincreases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway. • Airway mucus, edema, and contraction of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway \nresistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema • The density and viscosity of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance. A gas with more \ndensity imparts more resistance.",

The surfactant is a surface-active agent in water, which means that it greatly reduces the surface \ntension of water. Pulmonary surfactant is produced by type 2 pneumocytes. Most important components are • Phospholipid - dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) also known as Dipalmitoyl Lecithin. \nLecithin is the most abundant lipid in surfactant. • Phosphatidylglycerol- minor component • Surfactant apoproteins • Calcium ions. • 4 unique apoproteins of surfactant: surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. Clinical relevance: • Tests to assess fetal lung maturity: • L/S ratio i.e. Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio: Ratio  2 is considered normal. • Shake test/Bubble test/Clement test: Formation of stable foam in the presence of surfactant. • Phosphatidylglycerol levels in Amniotic fluid • Autosomal dominant familial interstitial lung disease has absent surfactant protein SP-C. • Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis - Autoantibody against GM-CSF which is involved in clearance of \nsurfactant. 360 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Decrease in surfactant increases the work of breathing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Surfactant helps to prevent alveolar collapse according to Law of Laplace.(Not Bernoulli's) Physiologic advantages of surfactant • By reducing surface tension it increases lung compliance • Reduces the lung's tendency to recoil • Helps to keep the alveoli dry • Helps to prevent pulmonary edema (Option A) The surface tension generates a pressure that tends to collapse the sphere. In accordance with Law of Laplace - P=2T/r, where P - Collapsing pressure on alveolus (dynes/cm2) or Pressure required to keep alveolus open \n(dynes/cm2) T = Surface tension (dynes/cm) r = Radius of the alveolus (cm). Collapsing pressure is inversely related to radius i.e. large alveolus (one with a large radius) will \nhave a low collapsing pressure and therefore will require only minimal pressure to keep it open. \nOn the other hand, a small alveolus (one with a small radius) will have a high collapsing pressure \nand require more pressure to keep it open. By reducing surface tension, surfactant reduces the collapsing pressure for a given radius. Option B: Surfactant deficiency is an important cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome \n(IRDS) also known as hyaline membrane disease, the serious pulmonary disease that develops in \ninfants born before their surfactant system is functional. • In IRDS, there is high surface tension in the lungs resulting in atelectasis • Also, there is retention of fluid in the lungs. • During fetal life, Cl- is secreted with fluid by the pulmonary epithelial cells. At birth, there is a \nshift to Na+ reabsorption by these cells via ENaC and fluid is absorbed along with Na+. Prolonged \nimmaturity of ENaC contributes to pulmonary edema in IRDS. Option D: Surfactant increases lung compliance, which reduces the work of expanding the lungs \nduring inspiration. Increasing the compliance of the lungs reduces the collapsing force at any \ngiven volume so that it is easier for the lungs to expand.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mechanism of action of surfactant is by breaking the structure of water in alveoli. When water forms a surface with air, the water molecules on the surface of the alveoli have a \nstrong attraction for one another. This pulls the molecules together, leading to high surface 361 \nSold by @itachibot tension. The surfactant is amphipathic in nature (i.e., hydrophobic on one end and hydrophilic on the \nother). They align themselves on the alveolar surface, with their hydrophobic portions facing the \nalveolar lumen. The cohesive force between a water molecule and an adjacent pulmonary surfactant molecule is \nvery low. So, they break up the attracting forces between water molecules lining the alveoli (which \nhad been responsible for the high surface tension). Thus, they reduce surface tension.",

Surfactant reduces the lung's tendency to recoil so that they do not collapse easily and so the \nstability of the alveoli is maintained. Factors that maintain alveolar stability • Pulmonary surfactant:  surface tension within alveoli • Mechanical interdependence: prevents alveolar collapse Interdependence The tendency of one alveolus to collapse is opposed by the traction exerted by the surrounding \nalveoli.
