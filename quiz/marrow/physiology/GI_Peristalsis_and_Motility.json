      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The interstitial cells of Cajal undergo cyclic changes in membrane potential due to unique ion \nchannels that periodically open and produce inward (pacemaker) currents that generate \nslow-wave activity. Interstitial cells of Cajal are the pacemaker cells of the GIT that initiate the basic electrical \nrhythm (BER). These are stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features. In the stomach and the small intestine, these cells are located in the circular smooth muscle layer \nnear the myenteric plexus. In the colon, they are at the submucosal border of the circular muscle \nlayer. The slow waves usually do not by themselves cause muscle contraction in most parts of the \ngastrointestinal tract, except perhaps in the stomach. Instead, they mainly excite the appearance \nof intermittent spike potentials, and the spike potentials in turn actually excite the muscle \ncontraction. Note: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal.",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, the least frequency of slow waves is seen in the stomach (4/min). 606 \nSold by @itachibot The Basal electrical rhythm (BER) also called slow-wave, is a rhythmic fluctuation of membrane \npotential in the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal. The \nmembrane potential fluctuates between -65mV and -45mV. The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle except in the esophagus and \nproximal stomach. The rate of BER in various sites is as follows: • Stomach: 4/min • Duodenum: 12/min • Distal ileum: 8/min • Cecum: 2/min • Sigmoid colon: 6/min The BER does not cause contraction of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER is \nsuperimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension. Acetylcholine causes an increase in the number of spike potentials and muscle \ntension. Epinephrine causes a decrease in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension. Muscle contraction can occur only when the motor stimulus is provided during the depolarisation \npart of the BER. Thus, BER does not cause muscle contraction by itself, but controls the rate and organization sites \nof the muscle contractions, as in coordination of the peristaltic activity and setting the rhythm of \nsegmentation.",

Slow waves, also known as basic electrical rhythm are partial depolarizations of smooth muscle \ncells, spreading along the GIT. They originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The smooth \nmuscles are in a hyperpolarized state, having a resting membrane potential of -50 to -60mV. These waves are not action potentials themselves and they do not cause any contractions. Slow \nwaves raise the membrane potential by 5-15mV, bringing it closer to the threshold enabling spike \npotential (true action potential) to occur. Therefore, they set the basic rhythm of GIT.",

When this pressure reaches 55 mm Hg, the external and the internal sphincter relax, and there is \nreflex expulsion of the contents of the rectum. Defecation reflex: Distension of the rectum and colon stimulates stretch receptors in the rectal \nwall. Then, the defecation reflexes travel from the colon and rectum to the spinal cord and back \nagain to produce the powerful colonic, rectal, and abdominal contractions required for defecation. 621 \nSold by @itachibot Glomerular Filtration Rate, Renal Blood Flow, and Renal Clearance",
