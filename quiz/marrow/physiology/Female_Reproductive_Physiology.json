      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "• Progesterone is the dominant hormone during the luteal phase. • The corpus luteum in the non-pregnant woman secretes large quantities of progesterone and a \nsmall amount of estrogen, as well as inhibin. • In terms of ovarian function, the menstrual cycle may be divided into two phases approximately \nequal in length and separated by ovulation (Figure): • The follicular phase, during which a mature follicle and secondary oocyte develop; and • The luteal phase begins after ovulation and lasts until the death of the corpus luteum. Follicular phase (days 0–14) • A primordial follicle develops to the Graafian stage, with atresia of neighboring follicles. • LH and FSH receptors are up-regulated in theca and granulosa cells. • Estradiol levels increase and cause proliferation of the uterus. • FSH and LH levels are suppressed by the negative feedback effect of estradiol on the anterior \npituitary. • Progesterone levels are low. Ovulation (day 14) • Occurs 14 days before menses, regardless of cycle length. Thus, in a 28-day cycle, ovulation \noccurs on day 14; in a 35-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 22. 793 \nSold by @itachibot • A burst of estradiol synthesis at the end of the follicular phase has a positive feedback effect on \nthe secretion of FSH and LH (LH surge). • Ovulation occurs as a result of the estrogen-induced LH surge. • Estrogen levels decrease just after ovulation (but rise again during the luteal phase). • Cervical mucus increases in quantity; it becomes less viscous and more penetrable by sperm. Luteal phase (days 14–28) • The corpus luteum begins to develop, and it synthesizes estrogen and progesterone. Vascularity \nand secretory activity of the endometrium increase to prepare for receipt of a fertilized egg. • Basal body temperature increases because of the effect of progesterone on the hypothalamic \nthermoregulatory center. • If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses at the end of the luteal phase. As a \nresult, estradiol and progesterone levels decrease abruptly. Menses (days 0–4) • The endometrium is sloughed because of the abrupt withdrawal of estradiol and progesterone 794 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Progesterone is mainly responsible for the maintenance of endometrial thickness in the \npost-ovulatory phase. The menstrual cycle consists of three phases: the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and the \nsecretory, or progestational, phase Menstrual phase: This phase is characterized by the discharge of blood and endometrial debris \nfrom the vagina. • It coincides with the end of the ovarian luteal phase and onset of a new follicular phase. • Withdrawal of progesterone on the degeneration of the corpus luteum (CL) leads simultaneously \nto sloughing of the endometrium (menstruation) and development of new follicles in the ovary \nunder the influence of rising gonadotropic hormone levels Proliferative Phase: Thus, menstrual flow ceases, and the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle \nbegins concurrently with the last portion of the ovarian follicular phase. • When the menstrual flow ceases, a thin endometrial layer less than 1-mm thick remains. \nEstrogen stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells, glands, and blood vessels in the endometrium, \nincreasing this lining to a thickness of 3 to 5 mm. • The estrogen-dominant proliferative phase lasts from the end of menstruation to ovulation. Peak \nestrogen levels trigger the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation. Secretory or Progestational Phase: After ovulation, when a new corpus luteum is formed, the \nuterus enters the secretory, or progestational, phase, which coincides in time with the ovarian \nluteal phase. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone and estrogen. \nProgesterone converts the thickened, estrogen-primed endometrium to a richly vascularized, \nglycogen-filled tissue. • This period is called either the secretory phase, because the endometrial glands are actively \nsecreting glycogen into the uterine lumen for early nourishment of a developing embryo before it 795 \nSold by @itachibot implants, or the progestational (“before pregnancy”) phase, referring to the development of a lush \nendometrial lining capable of supporting an early embryo after implantation. • If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and a new \nfollicular phase and menstrual phase begin again.",

Immediately after ovulation, corpus luteum is formed, which secretes progesterone in preparation \nof the body for potential pregnancy during that cycle. This progesterone acts on the hypothalamus \nand increases basal body temperature. Charting the daily basal body temperature will show an \nincrease of approximately 0.5 to 1 degrees fahrenheit shortly after ovulation. Since the rise in basal body temperature coincides with ovulation, abstaining from sexual \nintercourse until at least 3 days after the woman’s temperature has risen above her regular \ntemperature significantly lowers the chance of pregnancy. Alternatively, using barrier \nmethods (e.g. condom, diaphragm) during this time will prevent pregnancy. However several factors (e.g fever, sleep deprivation etc.) that change the basal body temperature, \ncan affect the efficacy and reliability of this method.",

      "explanation": "Estradiol is the predominant estrogen in the plasma of premenopausal non-pregnant women. It is \nprimarily secreted from ovaries. Estrone is synthesized from dehydroepiandrosterone in adipose tissue stroma. Estrone is the \nabundant circulating form of estrogen in postmenopausal women. In pregnancy, the placenta uses dehydroepiandrosterone and its 16 alpha hydroxyl derivative to \nform large amounts of estrone and estriol.",
