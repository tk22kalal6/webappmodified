      "explanation": "In humans, the effective renal plasma flow (eRPF) averages about 625 mL/min. Measurement of renal plasma flow (RPF) is done by measuring the clearance of \npara-aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is filtered and secreted by the renal tubules, hence it it can \nbe used for RPF measurement. where: • RPF = renal plasma flow (mL/min or mL/24 hour) • CPAH = clearance of PAH (mL/min or mL/24 hourr) • UPAH = urine concentration of PAH (mg/mL) 645 \nSold by @itachibot • V = urine flow rate (mL/min or mL/24 hour) • PPAH = plasma concentration of PAH (mg/mL) Note: Renal blood flow= Renal plasma flow/ 1- Hematocrit",

      "explanation": "True renal plasma flow (RPF) is obtained by dividing effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) by \nextraction ratio. When we inject para-aminohippuric acid, 90% of it is filtered through the glomerulus at the rate \nof 625mL per minute - which is the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). Using that, to we calculate \nthe true RPF, we divide it by the extraction ratio to account for the 10% that is not filtered by \ndividing the ERPF by 0.9, hence getting the final value of ~ 700mL per minute When peripheral venous plasma concentration of PAH is used for calculation of RPF, RPF \nobtained is called effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). This is because PAH concentration is \nessentially identical to that in the arterial plasma reaching the kidney.",

The stretch of the vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions from the extracellular \nfluid into the cells, causing them to contract.

This mechanism may be more important in protecting the kidney from hypertension-induced \ninjury.

      "explanation": "In the given graph, the order of filterability is A&gt;B&gt;C, which likely indicates that the \nsubstances are Polycationic, Neutral, Polyanionic. The glomerular filtration barrier is negatively charged, which will repel most of the negative \ncharged (anionic substances). Whereas, the cationic substances are easily filtered. Hence, the order of filterability would be: Polycationic &gt; Neutral &gt; Polyanionic, represented \nby A, B, and C in the graph shown. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of: 650 \nSold by @itachibot • Endothelium of the capillary • Basement membrane: • Lamina densa - electron-dense layer. It contains type IV collagen • Lamina rara interna - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge • Lamina rara externa - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge • Layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement \nmembrane The capillary endothelium is perforated by thousands of small holes called fenestrae, which \nmeasure from 4 nm up to 8nm. Therefore, neutral substances with molecular diameters of less \nthan 4 nm are freely filtered, and filtration of those with diameters of more than 8 nm approaches \nzero. However, in addition to the size of the particles, the filtration also depends mainly on the charge \nof the particle being filtered. The glomerular capillary wall consists of highly negatively charged \nproteins called sialoproteins, which repel the negatively charged substances (anions). The \nproperty can be studied by using charged dextran. When the filtration of the negatively and positively charged dextrans was studied, the results \nindicated that the negatively charged dextrans in the blood are repelled, with the result that \nfiltration of anionic substances 4 nm in diameter is less than half that of neutral substances of the \nsame size. This explains, why albumin despite having an effective molecular diameter of approximately 7 \nnm, has a very low filtration rate. 651 \nSold by @itachibot Renal Tubular Functions, Urine Concentration and Dilution",
