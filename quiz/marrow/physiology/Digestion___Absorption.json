      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Glucose is absorbed in the intestine by secondary active transport. On the basolateral side, there is active transport of sodium ions out of the cell into the interstitial \nfluid. This depletes sodium inside the cell. Because of this Na+ concentration difference, more \nNa+ binds to the SGLT on the luminal side. This increases the affinity of SGLT for glucose and \nglucose binds to it. Then, both the Na+ and glucose are transported together to the interior of the cell. Thus, glucose \nis absorbed in the intestine by secondary active transport. The energy for glucose transport is \nprovided indirectly, by the active transport of Na+ out of the cell. The glucose moves out of the \ncell into the blood across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion mediated via GLUT. 586 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Ghrelin increases gastric acid secretion. Ghrelin is mainly produced by the endocrine cells in the oxyntic gland area of the stomach. It is \nalso secreted by the pancreas and adrenal glands. Functions: • Increases appetite/food intake (orexigenic) • Inhibits leptin release 595 \nSold by @itachibot • Stimulates growth hormone secretion by directly acting on anterior pituitary (ghrelin-growth \nhormone-releasing peptide) • Increases gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake • Regulates the distribution and rate of use of energy",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A patient with a BMI of 34 kg/m2 is categorized as obese. Leptin levels are high in obesity. Leptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone synthesized from adipocytes. The larger the fat stores, \nthe more leptin is released into the blood. Leptin resistance in obese persons may be due to its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier and \nreach the hypothalamus to serve its appetite-suppressing function. Note: A recent study has indicated that triglycerides which are elevated in obesity, inhibit the \ntransport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier.",

      "explanation": "Lingual lipases are of little quantitative significance for lipid digestion other than in the setting of \npancreatic insufficiency. Lingual lipase is secreted by Ebner glands on the dorsal surface of the tongue in some species, and \nthe stomach also secretes lipase. Digestion of Lipids • Pancreatic lipase is the most important enzyme involved in lipid digestion.

Vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by \nthe parietal cells of the stomach, and the complex is absorbed across the ileal mucosa. Hence after \nileal resection, there is impaired absorption of vitamin B12.",
