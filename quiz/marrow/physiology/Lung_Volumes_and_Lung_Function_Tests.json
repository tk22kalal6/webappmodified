      "explanation": "The green curve in the above image and the case scenario denotes that the diagnosis is likely to be \nemphysema. Maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV): When a person expires with great force, the expiratory \nairflow reaches a maximum flow beyond which the flow cannot be increased anymore, even with \ngreatly increased additional force. In obstructive airway disease like Emphysema, it is usually much more difficult to expire than to \ninspire because the closing tendency of the airways is greatly increased by the extra positive \npressure during expiration. Due to the obstruction of the airways and because they collapse more \neasily than normal airways, the maximum expiratory flow rate is greatly reduced (But, total lung \ncapacity and residual volume is increased) which is shown in the green curve below. Other options given above will cause constricted lungs where the lungs cannot expand to a normal \nmaximum volume. Hence, even with the greatest possible expiratory effort, the maximum 431 \nSold by @itachibot expiratory flow rate will be reduced.
