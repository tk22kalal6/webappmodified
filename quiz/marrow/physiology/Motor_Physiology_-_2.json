      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "When dynamic -motor neurons are activated at the same time as  -motor neurons to muscle, the \nnumber of impulses in spindle Ia afferents is greater than when  discharge alone is increased. • When  – coactivation occurs, intrafusal and extrafusal fibers shorten together, and spindle \nafferent activity can occur throughout the period of muscle contraction. • Stimulation of -motor neurons causes increase discharge in spindle Ia afferent, leading to reflex \ncontraction of the muscle. • When a muscle contracts it leads to shortening of the muscle spindles and so impulses in the Ia \nafferents decreases. • Thus, muscles can be made to contract via stimulation of the  -motor neurons that innervate the \nextrafusal fibers or the -motor neurons that initiate contraction indirectly via the stretch reflex. • If the whole muscle is stretched during stimulation of the -motor neurons, the rate of discharge \nin the Ia fibers is further increased. Increased -motor neuron activity thus increases spindle \nsensitivity during stretch. This is the basis of the Jendrassik manouver. 296 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The figure shows the typical myogram recorded from a muscle involved in a crossed extensor \nreflex. This myogram demonstrates the relatively long latency before the reflex begins and the \nlong after-discharge at the end of the stimulus. • When a painful stimulus is applied to the body, the flexor withdrawal and the crossed extensor \nreflexes are stimulated. • About 0.2 to 0.5 seconds after the flexor reflex in one limb, the opposite limb begins to extend. \nThis reflex is called the crossed extensor reflex. • After the painful stimulus is removed, the crossed extensor reflex has an even longer period of \nafter-discharge than does the flexor reflex. This prolonged after-discharge results from \nreverberating circuits among the inter-neuronal cells. Compare the myograms of a flexor reflex with a crossed extensor reflex. In the flexor reflex, the contraction occurs immediately after applying the stimulus and the \nafter-discharge is smaller.",

When the bulboreticular facilitatory region transmits excitatory signals through the gamma nerve \nfibers to the intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindles, it shortens the ends of the spindles \nand stretches the central receptor regions, thus increasing their signal output. If the spindles on \nboth sides of each joint are activated at the same time, then reflex excitation of the skeletal \nmuscles on both sides of the joint increases, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other at \nthe joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized. Any time a person must perform a muscle function that requires a high degree of delicate and \nexact positioning, the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the brain stem stabilizes the positions of \nthe proximal joints.",

Sham rage is a controversial term used to describe behavior such as biting, clawing, hissing, \narching the back and \"violent alternating limb movements\" produced in animal experiments by \nremoving the cerebral cortex, which is claimed to occur in the absence of any sort of inner \nexperience of rage. The reason for this might be that the removal of the neocortex causes a loss of inhibition of the \nareas involved in the rage reaction, causing those areas to become hyperactive (due to an \nuninhibited hypothalamus). Removal of hypothalamus abolishes the sham rage. Sham rage may be triggered by very mild stimuli such as weak touch. It is also non-goal directed.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Pacinian corpuscle is not involved in the clasp knife effect. • When the muscles are hypertonic, the sequence of moderate stretch leads to muscle contraction, \nstrong stretch leads to muscle relaxation. Eg. Passive flexion of the elbow meets immediate \nresistance due to stretch reflex in the triceps muscle. Further stretch activates the inverse stretch \nreflex. The resistance to flexion suddenly collapses, and the arm flexes. This sequence of \nresistance followed by a sudden decrease in resistance when a limb is moved passively is known as \nthe clasp-knife effect because of its resemblance to the closing of a pocket knife. • Lengthening reaction: When the tension on the muscle becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect \nfrom the Golgi tendon organ leads to an instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle. It is a \nprotective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle. 300 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 20: A 50-year-old gentleman who is a known patient of parkinson's disease, develops \nrefractoriness to L-dopa therapy. An alternative treatment modality is being planned, which \nemploys ablation of certain thalamic regions by neurosurgery. Which thalamic nucleus is the \nstereotaxic target for the neurosurgeons?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Striatum",
        "b": "Globus pallidus",
        "c": "Maintenance of equilibrium",
        "d": "Skilled movements"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The ventrolateral thalamic nucleus is the stereotaxic target for the neurosurgeons to alleviate \nsymptoms in Parkinson's disease refractory to levodopa. • The two major outputs of the basal ganglia are from GPi and substantia nigra pars reticulata. \nBoth are inhibitory (GABAergic) and both project to the ventrolateral and ventroanterior \nthalamus. From the thalamus, there is an excitatory (presumably glutamate) projection to the \nprefrontal and premotor cortex. This completes a full cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop. Therefore stereotactic ablation of ventrolateral thalamic nucleus helps in alleviation of symptoms \nin parkinson's disease refractory to levodopa. 306 \nSold by @itachibot Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum",
