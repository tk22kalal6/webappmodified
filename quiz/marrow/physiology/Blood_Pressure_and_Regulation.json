      "explanation": "Mean arterial pressure is diastolic + 1/3rd pulse pressure. The mean pressure is the average pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. It is not equal to the \naverage of systolic and diastolic pressure because, at normal heart rates, a greater fraction of the \ncardiac cycle is spent in diastole than in systole. The mean arterial pressure is therefore \ndetermined by about 60 percent by the diastolic pressure and 40 percent by the systolic pressure. Mean BP= DBP + 1/3 Pulse pressure = DBP +1/3(SBP- DBP) = (3DBP+SBP- DBP)/3 = 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP",

The resultant rise in systemic arterial pressure (Cushing reflex) tends to restore \nthe blood flow to the medulla. Cushing reflex causes a triad of symptoms: • Reflex bradycardia (via arterial baroreceptors) • Hypertension (with widened pulse pressure) • Irregular respiration (bradypnea)",

Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers located in the cardiopulmonary region (ex: ventricles, \natria, great veins, pulmonary artery, juxtacapillary region of alveoli) causes profound bradycardia, \nhypotension, and apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. This response is called \nBezold-Jarisch reflex. Other substances that can cause Bezold–Jarisch reflex are capsaicin, phenyl biguanide, and \nveratridine.",

      "explanation": "There is a decreased firing from the baroreceptors. • When a person stands up from a lying down position, it causes pooling of the blood in the legs, \ndue to gravity. This reduces the venous return and causes a decrease in cardiac output. • Reduced cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, which in turn causes reduced firing \nfrom baroreceptors. • As a result, the vagal tone is suppressed leading to increased heart rate. 555 \nSold by @itachibot Gastrointestinal Secretion and Gastrointestinal Hormones",
