      "explanation": "Lipid-soluble substances are transported across the cell membrane via diffusion. • The rate of diffusion depends directly on lipid solubility. • Characteristics of simple diffusion • The only form of transport that is not carrier-mediated • Occurs down an electrochemical gradient (“downhill”) • Does not require metabolic energy and therefore is passive • Permeability • Describes the ease with which a solute diffuses through a membrane • Depends on the characteristics of the solute and the membrane • Small hydrophobic solutes (e.g., O2) have the highest permeabilities in lipid membranes. • Hydrophilic solutes (e.g., Na+) must cross cell membranes through water-filled channels, or \npores. If the solute is an ion, then its flux will depend on both the concentration difference and the \npotential difference across the membrane.",

      "explanation": "Transcytosis is seen in epithelial cells of intestine. Transcytosis is endocytosis across one \nmembrane of the cell followed by exocytosis across the opposite membrane. Transcytosis across epithelia or endothelia: Some molecules, such as proteins, are too large to \ndiffuse through the membrane or cross the membrane transporters of epithelia. Instead they are \nmoved across epithelia by transcytosis. Steps: • The molecule is brought into the epithelial cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. 52 \nSold by @itachibot • The resulting vesicle attaches to microtubules in the cells cytoskeleton and is transported across \nthe cell by vesicular transport. • At the opposite side of the epithelium, the contents of the vesicle are expelled into the interstitial \nfluid by exocytosis. Significance: • Transcytosis makes it possible for large proteins to move across an epithelium and remain \nintact. • It is the means by which infants absorb maternal antibodies in breast milk. The antibodies are \nabsorbed on the apical surface of the infant’s intestinal epithelium and then released into the \nextracellular fluid.",

      "explanation": "Emeiocytosis requires Ca2+ directly. Emeiocytosis is the movement of secretory granules to the plasma membrane of the cell, fusion of \nthe granule surface membrane with the cell membrane, rupture of membranes, and liberation of \ngranular contents into the pericapillary space. Insulin secretion (as shown in the image below): 53 \nSold by @itachibot • Glucose enters B cells by GLUT-2 transporters. • It is phosphorylated and metabolized to pyruvate (Pyr) in the cytoplasm. • The Pyr enters the mitochondria and is metabolized via the citric acid cycle. The ATP formed by \noxidative phosphorylation inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, reducing K+ efflux. • This depolarizes the B cell, and Ca2+ influx is increased. The Ca2+ stimulates the release of \ninsulin by exocytosis. Glutamate (Glu) is also formed, and this primes secretory granules, \npreparing them for exocytosis. It is promoted by Ca2+,  K+ It is inhibited by Mg2+, K+ depletion. The process of emeiocytosis for insulin secretion is depicted in the image below. 54 \nSold by @itachibot Membrane Potentials",
