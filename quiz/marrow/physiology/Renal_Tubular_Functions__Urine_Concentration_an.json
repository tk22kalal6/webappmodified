Since creatinine is secreted by the tubules, the clearance of creatinine will \nbe slightly higher than inulin. Hence, it overestimates GFR. Inulin is completely filtered and never reabsorbed. Hence, it can be used for GFR estimation. Glucose is completely reabsorbed below the renal threshold (i.e ~180mg/dl) in PCT.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The actual renal threshold is about 200 mg/dL (i.e., 2 g/L ) (1g/L=100mg/dl) and the transport \nmaximum for glucose is 375 mg/min. For substances that are actively reabsorbed or secreted, there is a limit to the rate at which \nthe solute can be transported, which is referred to as the transport maximum. This limit is due to \nsaturation of the specific transport systems involved. Normally, measurable glucose does not appear in the urine because essentially all the \nfiltered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The transport maximum for glucose is about 375 mg/min, whereas the filtered load of glucose is \nonly about 125 mg/min. With large increases in GFR and/or plasma glucose concentration \nthat increase the filtered load of glucose above 375 mg/min, the excess glucose filtered is not \nreabsorbed and passes into the urine. When the plasma glucose concentration is 100 mg/100 ml and the filtered load is at its normal \nlevel (125 mg/min) there is no loss of glucose in the urine. However, when the plasma \nconcentration of glucose rises above about 200 mg/100 ml, increasing the filtered load to about \n250 mg/min, a small amount of glucose begins to appear in the urine. This point is termed as the \nthreshold for glucose. Splay is due to separation between filtered load and exceretion. It occurs due to different \ntransport maximums of different nephrons. 668 \nSold by @itachibot",

Excreted Filtered Load: The filtered load of PAH increases linearly as the unbound concentration of PAH \nincreases (filtered load = GFR. [P]PAH).

When the PAH concentration increases to a level \nwhere the carriers are saturated, Tm is reached. After this point, no matter how much the PAH \nconcentration increases, there can be no further increase in the secretion rate. Excretion. For a secreted substance such as PAH, excretion is the sum of filtration and \nsecretion. At low PAH concentrations (below Tm), excretion increases steeply with increases in \nplasma PAH concentration because both filtration and secretion are increasing. At PAH \nconcentrations above Tm, excretion increases less steeply (and parallels the curve for filtration) \nbecause only the filtration component increases as concentration increases; secretion is already \nsaturated.",

Hence, the clearance is zero. In uncontrolled diabetes, since the plasma \nglucose concentration is greater than the renal threshold for reabsorption, excess glucose is \nexcreted in the urine and the clearance is greater than zero.

They detect sodium \nconcentration of the fluid in the tubule (chemoreceptor). In response to elevated sodium, the \nmacula densa cells trigger the contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing the flow of blood to \nthe glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate. This happens as follows: When there is \nincreased sodium, there is increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity which leads to increased \nATP hydrolysis causing more adenosine formation. The adenosine receptors on the macula densa \ncells stimulate it to release more calcium, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, \nthereby decreasing the GFR. • Lacis cells: Extraglomerular mesangial cells situated between afferent and efferent arteriole. • Granular cells/JG cells: Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secrete \nrenin. Fall in pressure in afferent arteriole stimulates renin release (mechanoreceptor), which, in \nturn, increases blood pressure. 677 \nSold by @itachibot Acid-Base Balance, Renal Hormones and Micturition Reflex",
