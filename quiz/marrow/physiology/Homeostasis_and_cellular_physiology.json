      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Homeostasis is called dynamic equilibrium because the body maintains an internal balance within \nfluctuating limits. It describes the maintenance of nearly constant conditions in the internal \nenvironment despite changes in the outside world. A number of variables such as body temperature, blood sugar levels, blood pH, etc. are regulated \nwithin a range of values (homeostatic ranges) and not at fixed values. These variables are not given equal importance. There is a hierarchy of importance so that the \nconstancy of certain variables may be altered markedly to maintain others within their normal \nrange. For example, respiratory or metabolic compensation to maintain blood pH. The disruption of homeostasis either due to extreme environmental challenge or a breakdown of \ninternal homeostatic mechanisms is termed as a disease.",

Components of homeostasis include: • Stimulus - It is a detectable change in the internal or external environment, such as change in \ntemperature. • Receptor - It detects environmental changes. • Integrating centre • Effector - It is an organ or cell that acts in response to a stimulus. 11 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "The increased heart rate in response to a decrease in blood pressure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Feedback regulation is seen in the increased heart rate in response to a decrease in blood \npressure. This is because, in feedback regulation, the homeostatic response (increased heart rate) \noccurs after the change (decrease in blood pressure) has occurred. On the other hand, in feedforward regulation, the homeostatic responses take place before the \nchange has occurred. This is done in anticipation of the change to minimize fluctuations. \nExamples of feedforward regulation include: • The increased heart rate that occurs in an athlete just before a sprint begins. • The smell of food triggers the secretion of salivary and gastric juices. • An increase in insulin before glucose absorption has raised blood glucose levels.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Positive feedback is seen in all except gastric secretion. It is under negative feedback control. Negative feedback consists of certain changes that affect a deficient or excessive variable to pull it \nback to a certain mean value to maintain homeostasis. Most processes in the body are under \nnegative feedback. For example, an increase in gastric acids leading to a decrease in gastric \nsecretion. Positive feedback consists of changes that affect a variable to push it further away from a certain \nmean value. For example, an increase in LH leading to a further increase in LH. Instances, where \npositive feedback plays an important role are: • Clotting of blood • Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum • LH Surge • Action potential • Shock • Parturition",
