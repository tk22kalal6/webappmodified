      "explanation": "• Each muscle spindle is 3 to 10 millimeters long. It is built around 3 to 12 tiny intrafusal muscle \nfibers that are attached to the glycocalyx of the surrounding large extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. • Each intrafusal muscle fiber is a tiny skeletal muscle fiber. However, the central region of each of \nthese fibers has few or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion does not \ncontract when the ends do. Instead, it functions as a sensory receptor. The end portions that do \ncontract are excited by small gamma motor nerve fibers.",

On the contralateral side, flexors \nare inhibited and extensors are stimulated (crossed extension reflex) to maintain balance. It results in flexion on the ipsilateral side and extension on the contralateral side. Somatosensory and pain afferent fibers elicit withdrawal of the stimulated body part from the \nnoxious stimulus. 272 \nSold by @itachibot Pain (e.g., touching a hot stove) stimulates the flexor reflex afferents of groups II, III, and IV.

Further, because of after-discharge, the reflex can hold the irritated part away from the \nstimulus for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the irritation is over.

      "explanation": "• The pontine and medullary reticulospinal tracts are involved in maintainance of posture and in \nmodulating muscle tone especially via an input to ■- motor neurons. • Pontine reticulospinal neurons are primarily excitatory and medullary reticulospinal neurons are \nprimarily inhibitory. • Stimulation of -motor neurons does not lead directly to detectable contraction of the muscles \nbecause the intrafusal fibers are not strong enough or plentiful enough to cause shortening. • However, stimulation does cause the contractile ends of the intrafusal fibers to shorten and \ntherefore stretches the nuclear bag portion of the spindles, deforming the endings, and initiating \nimpulses in the Ia fibers . This in turn can lead to reflex contraction of the muscle. • Thus, muscles can be made to contract via stimulation of the  -motor neurons that innervate the \nextrafusal fibers or the -motor neurons that initiate contraction indirectly via the stretch reflex.",

      "explanation": "In decerebrate rigidity, there is rigidity in extensor muscles of all the four extremities (not all \nmuscles of the body). Decerebration • Complete transection of the brain stem between the superior and inferior colliculi permits the \nbrain stem pathways to function independently of their input from higher brain structures. This is \ncalled a mid-collicular decerebration. • This lesion interrupts all input from the cortex (corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts) and red \nnucleus (rubrospinal tract), primarily to distal muscles of the extremities. 281 \nSold by @itachibot • The excitatory and inhibitory reticulospinal pathways (primarily to postural extensor muscles) \nremain intact. • The dominance of drive from ascending sensory pathways to the excitatory reticulospinal \npathway leads to hyperactivity in extensor muscles in all four extremities which are called \ndecerebrate rigidity. • The excitatory input from the reticulospinal pathway activates -motor neurons which indirectly \nactivate  -motor neurons (via Ia spindle afferent activity). This is called the gamma loop. Option 4. Spinal shock is different from decebrate rigidity as it is a transient state that can occur \nimmediately after a spinal cord injury.
