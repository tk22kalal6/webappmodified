Salivary  amylase (Ptyalin): • Digests starch: cleaves internal  -1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch • Optimum pH: 7 • Denatured at pH 4 Since a large portion of a meal often remains unmixed for a considerable length of time in the \nstomach, the salivary enzyme may account for the digestion of as much as 75% of the starch \npresent before it is denatured by gastric acid. Note: Even in the absence of salivary amylase, there is no defect in carbohydrate digestion \nbecause pancreatic amylase is sufficient to digest all of the ingested starch.",

      "explanation": "Gastric secretion is inhibited by somatostatin. It inhibits gastric secretion via both direct and indirect pathways: • Direct pathway - somatostatin acts directly on the acid-producing parietal cells by binding to \nreceptors on parietal cells that are coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a Gi protein. This inhibits \nadenylyl cyclase, and cAMP levels are reduced. In this way, somatostatin antagonizes the \nstimulatory effect of histamine on H+ secretion. • Indirect pathway - somatostatin inhibits the release of histamine and gastrin and thus \ndecreasing H+ secretion indirectly.",
