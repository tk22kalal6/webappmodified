      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Transport of CO is diffusion limited because of the high affinity of CO to hemoglobin. Diffusion across the alveolocapillary membrane: • Blood takes 0.75s to traverse pulmonary capillaries. • CO diffuses into blood and combines with Hb with very high affinity. Thus the partial pressure of \nCO doesn't rise (Only dissolved form of gas can increase the partial pressure, Gas which combines \nwith Hb or plasma proteins cannot). Partial pressure gradient necessary for diffusion of CO is \nmaintained for the whole 0.75s and hence it is Diffusion limited. • In the case of N2O it does not react and reaches equilibrium in about 0.1s. The amount of N2O \ntaken up is not limited by diffusion but by the amount of blood flowing through the pulmonary \ncapillaries; that is, it is Flow-limited. • O2 is intermediate between N2O and CO; it is taken up by haemoglobin, but much less avidly \nthan CO, and it reaches equilibrium with capillary blood in about 0.3 s. Thus, its uptake is \nPerfusion-limited. In the case of perfusion limited gases, an increase in pulmonary blood flow increases the amount \nof gas transferred. Hence O2 transport increases with an increase in pulmonary blood flow.",

      "explanation": "The presence of hemoglobin in normal arterial blood increases its O2 concentration \napproximately by 70 times • Normal arterial blood has Po2 of about 100 mm Hg. Amount of O2 transported in dissolved form (Calculated by using Henry's law): • Concentration of dissolved O2 = Partial pressure of O2 × solubility of O2 = 100 mmHg × 0.003 \nmL O2/100 mL blood per mm Hg = 0.3 mL O2/100 mL • Hence 1L of plasma has 3mL of 02 in dissolved form. • 5L of plasma can carry maximum 15mL of 02. • At rest, O2 demand is around 250mL/min. • Hence dissolved O2 alone is not sufficient to meet body demands. Amount of O2 transported bound to Hb: • Concentration of Hb is 15g/100 mL • Each gram of Hb binds to 1.34 mL of O2 • Hence, 15 g binds to 20.1mL of O2/100 mL • On average, the 15 g of hemoglobin in 100 mL of blood can combine with a total of about 20 mL \nof O2. Thus, this value (20.1) in the presence of Hb is about 70 times the value (0.3) in the absence of \nHb. 406 \nSold by @itachibot",

In deoxyhemoglobin, the globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration, which \nreduces the affinity of the molecule for O2. When O 2 is first bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) \nconfiguration, which exposes more O2 binding sites. The net result is a 500-fold increase in O2 In tissues, these reactions are reversed, resulting in O2 dissociation .",

The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve relates percentage saturation of the O2 carrying power \nof hemoglobin (abbreviated as SaO2) to the Po2. It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the \nT–R interconversion.

      "explanation": "411 \nSold by @itachibot Facilitation of oxygen transport depends on the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, explained \nby the Bohr effect. When the metabolic activity of tissues increases, the production of CO2 increases. This CO2 \ndiffuses into the blood and in turn, raises the blood H2CO3 and causes an increase in the H+ \nconcentration and a decrease in pH. This decreases the affinity of Hb for O2, shifting the O2- \nhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. This facilitates the unloading of O2 in the tissues. The \neffect of Pco2 and pH on O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve is called the Bohr Effect. Conversely, in the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood to the alveoli and the H+ concentration \ndecreases and theO2 hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left increasing the affinity of Hb \nto O2. Note: Double Bohr effect occurring in the placenta: Oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve of fetal \nblood and maternal blood move in opposite directions. Mechanism: • The fetal blood entering the placenta carries large amounts of carbon dioxide, but most of \nit diffuse from the fetal blood into the maternal blood. • Fetal blood - loss of CO2 - reduced H+ - shift to left - loading of O2 i.e. oxygenation of fetal Hb. • Maternal blood - increase in CO2 - increase in H+ - shift to the right - Release of oxygen.",

The  chains of adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A) are replaced by  chains in HbF. This \nmodification results in increased affinity of hemoglobin for O2, a left shift of the O2-hemoglobin \ndissociation curve, and decreased P50. The mechanism of the left shift is based on the binding of 2,3-DPG. 2,3-DPG does not bind as \navidly to the  chains of HbF as it binds to the  chains of hemoglobin A. When less 2,3-DPG is \nbound, the affinity for O2 increases and facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the \nfetus.

The equilibrium between Hb and O2 can be \nunderstood from the following equation: HbO2 + 2,3-DPG ■ Hb2,3-DPG + O2 In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall. As a result, stored blood releases less oxygen to \nthe tissues than the normal circulating blood, thus limiting its use in hypoxic patients (Eg: \nanaemia). However, such a fall in 2,3 DPG is less when it is stored in a phosphate-containing solution like \nCPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine), rather than ACD (Acid citrate dextrose).

When blood is saturated with 100% O2, the haemoglobin is also 100% saturated and each gram of \nnormal haemoglobin contains 1.39 mL of O2. However, blood normally contains some inactive haemoglobin derivatives, and the measured \nvalue in vivo is thus slightly lower hence, each gram of haemoglobin in vivo contains 1.31 mL of \nO2 (Hufner’s constant). According to the above question, when Hb=14g/dl, O2= 1.31*14= 18.34 The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve • Demonstrates a progressive increase in the percentage of haemoglobin bound with oxygen as \nblood Po2 increases, which is called the percent saturation of haemoglobin. 414 \nSold by @itachibot • Blood leaving the lungs and entering the systemic arteries usually has a Po2 of about 95 mm Hg, \nthe usual oxygen saturation of systemic arterial blood averages 97 per cent. • Conversely, in normal venous blood returning from the peripheral tissues, the Po2 is about 40 \nmm Hg, and the saturation of haemoglobin averages 75 per cent. 415 \nSold by @itachibot Lung Volumes and Lung Function Tests",
