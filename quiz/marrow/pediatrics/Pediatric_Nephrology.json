      "explanation": "In a child with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, all killed vaccines can be given. Option A: Live virus vaccines are administered with caution in children receiving corticosteroid \ntherapy. They can be given to patients in whom the prednisone dose is below 1mg/kg daily or \n2mg/kg on alternate days. If the patient is receiving corticosteroid-sparing agents \n(cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine), live virus vaccines are contraindicated. Option C: Only live vaccines are contraindicated in this child. Full pneumococcal vaccination (with \nthe 13-valent conjugate vaccine and 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine) and influenza vaccination \ncan be given annually to the child and their household contacts. Option D: Immunization of siblings/healthy household contacts with live vaccines is necessary to \nreduce the risk of infection transmission to the immunosuppressed child. Direct exposure to the \ngastrointestinal/respiratory secretions of the household contacts is avoided for about 3-6 weeks \nafter vaccination. Minimal change nephrotic syndrome is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It \nis characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. The \ndiagnosis is confirmed by performing a urinalysis and urine protein: creatinine ratio. Nephrotic \nrange proteinuria is proteinuria greater than 3.5 g per 24 hours (3+ or 4+) or a urine protein : \ncreatinine ratio exceeding 2. The recommended initial treatment for nephrotic syndrome is a daily dose of 2mg/kg (max 60mg) \nof prednisolone for 6 weeks followed by an alternate dose of 1.5mg/kg (max 40mg) for the next 6-8 \nweeks.
