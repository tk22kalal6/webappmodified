In a child with simian crease and normal growth and \ndevelopment, reassurance should be provided. • A simian crease is one of the findings of Down's syndrome however presence of only this finding \nshould not lead to a diagnosis of Down's syndrome. • Maternal history of phenytoin intake during pregnancy does not lead to this finding. However, \nmaternal alcohol intake can be associated with this condition. • Chromosomal analysis in an otherwise well child is not indicated.",
