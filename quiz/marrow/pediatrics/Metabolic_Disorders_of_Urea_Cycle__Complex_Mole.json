      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "All of the above agents are used in the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in an infant. Treatment of acute hyperammonemia in an infant: • Provide adequate calories, fluid, and electrolytes intravenously. • Minimal amounts of protein as a mixture of essential amino acids during the first 24 hours of \ntherapy. • Give priming doses of the following compounds: Sodium benzoate, Sodium \nphenylacetate, Arginine hydrochloride. • Initiate peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if the above treatment fails to produce an appreciable \ndecrease in plasma ammonia levels. Benzoate forms hippurate with endogenous glycine in the liver. Each mole of benzoate removes 1 \nmole of ammonia as glycine. Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is readily excreted \nin the urine. One mole of phenylacetate removes 2 moles of ammonia as glutamine from the body. Arginine administration supplies the urea cycle with ornithine. It is effective in all patients, except \nthose with arginase deficiency. Note: Phenylbutyrate which is metabolized to phenylacetate in our body can also be used as it scavenges \nnitrogen.",

        "d": "Hurler's syndrome"

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "This clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of I-cell disease or inclusion cell disease. It is also \nknown as type II Mucolipidosis. It is an autosomal recessive inherited as a lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused due to a defect \nin N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase required for the Golgi to phosphorylate mannose \nresidues on glycoproteins. This leads to defective mannose-6-phosphate, an important cell \nsignaling molecule required for trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme from the site of its production \nin the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. Due to this defect, the lysosomal enzymes are \nsecreted out of the cell and there is an increased serum concentration of the same. Intracellularly, \nthere are abnormal inclusion bodies and vacuolizations, thus earning the disease its name. Clinically, these patients present with symptoms either at birth or early in life with growth \nretardation, failure to thrive, delay of developmental milestones, coarse facial features with a \ncloudy cornea and gingival hypertrophy, and other non-specific findings such as hip dislocations, \ninguinal hernias, hepatomegaly, joint limitation, and skin changes. Investigations to establish a diagnosis may include \nmeasuring N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity in WBCs or in cultured fibroblasts \nand estimating serum levels of lysosomal enzymes. Option B: Galactosemia is caused due to the complete absence of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl \ntransferase. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability to convert galactose-1-phosphate \n(galactose-1-P) to uridine diphosphate galactose. It is characterized by typical clinical features \nsuch as jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, diarrhea, \nE.Coli sepsis. Infants may also have edema, ascites, full fontanelle, encephalopathy, and excessive 272 \nSold by @itachibot bruising and bleeding. They tend to develop cataracts due to the accumulation of galactitol. Option C: Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder of -oxidation of fatty acids. \nThere is a very large chain fatty acids buildup in the adrenal glands, the white matter of the brain, \nand testes. It is a progressive disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, coma, and death. Option D: Hurler syndrome is an important diagnosis in a patient presenting with clinical features \ngiven in this clinical vignette. But it is a mucopolysaccharidosis type 1-H caused due by the defect \nin the -L Iduronidase leading to the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. It is \ncharacterized by skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe intellectual disability. \nInfants develop characteristic coarse facial features, a wide nasal bridge, and a flattened midface. \nFeatures such as hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and typical skeletal \nabnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex laos are also seen. They also have developmental \ndelays and recurrent sinopulmonary diseases. Failure to thrive and growth restriction are also \nseen.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Aldolase B deficiency is likely in this child. In the given case scenario, the child becomes symptomatic after ingesting fruit juice that contains \nfructose; this indicates that she has hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by the \ndeficiency of aldolase B. Deficiency of fructose-1,6- bisphosphate aldolase (Aldolase B hereditary fructose \nintolerance): Fructose aldolase B is present in the liver, kidney, and intestine. It catalyzes the \nhydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into triose phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate. Clinical features: Patients are asymptomatic until fructose or sucrose is ingested (usually from \nfruit, fruit juice, sweetened cereal, or table sugar). Clinical features include jaundice, \nhepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. It resembles galactosemia. Acute \ningestion causes symptomatic hypoglycemia. Chronic intake results in failure to thrive and hepatic \ndisease. The persistence of fructose intake can lead to liver failure, kidney failure, and death. Diagnosis: Reducing substance is seen in the urine during an episode (Benedict's test +). An \nassay of fructaldolase B activity in the liver gives a definitive diagnosis. Treatment: Complete elimination of all sources of sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol from the diet. \nWith age, symptoms become milder even after fructose ingestion. The long-term prognosis is \ngood. Note: The deficiency of fructokinase is not associated with any clinical manifestations. Fructosuria is an \naccidental finding usually made because the asymptomatic patient's urine contains a reducing \nsubstance. No treatment is necessary, and the prognosis is excellent.",
