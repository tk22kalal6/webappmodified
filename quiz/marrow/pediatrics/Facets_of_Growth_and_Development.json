      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Thumbsucking in a child is a way of discharging tension. It is a self-limiting habit disorder, \nusually seen between 6 months to 2 years. Option A: Pica is persistent ingestion of non-nutritive substances for at least 1 month. It hampers \nthe development of the child and requires clinical attention. Children with pica are at an increased \nrisk of lead poisoning, iron-deficiency anemia, and parasitic infections. Option B: Breath-holding spells: It is preceded by a provocative event such as anger. Crying stops \nat full expiration. Child may have apnoea, cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or even loss of \nconsciousness, and generalized tonic–clonic seizure (GTCS). Subtypes include cyanotic, pallid, and \nmixed episodes. Seizures and cardiac causes should be ruled out. Parents should be reassured \nthat breath-holding spells are self-limiting. Option D: Enuresis: • When the child has never been dry, it is called primary enuresis. • When the bedwetting starts after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night, it is \ntermed as secondary enuresis. • Nocturnal enuresis is caused due to maturational delay. In a normal individual, antidiuretic \nhormone (ADH) levels usually peak between 4 am and 8 am. This circadian rhythm is impaired in \nnocturnal enuresis, leading to bedwetting. • Treatment - Behavioural therapy with positive reinforcement, bladder alarms, and desmopressin \nreserved for cases resistant to behavioural therapy.",
