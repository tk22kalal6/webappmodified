      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of mumps. Meningoencephalitis can occur before, along \nwith, or after parotitis. Most commonly, it manifests 5 days after parotitis. Mumps is caused by RNA paramyxovirus. It is spread from person to person via droplets from \nclinical and subclinical cases. The incubation period is 12-21 days. The virus appears in the saliva \nfrom up to 7 days before to as long as 7 days after the onset of parotid swelling. The patient presents with prodrome lasting 1-2 days consisting of fever, headache, and vomiting. \nAfter the prodrome, unilateral or bilateral parotitis develops, which is tender. It may be associated \nwith ipsilateral ear pain. Ingestion of sour or acidic foods may enhance pain. It can be prevented by administering live attenuated, MMR vaccine at 9 months, 15 months and \n4-6 years. Option B: Mumps can affect all the salivary glands, but most commonly affects parotid glands. Option C: The patient is infectious from 7 days before to 7 days after the onset of parotid swelling. Option D: Orchitis or oophoritis is a common finding in mumps, along with parotitis. But, mumps \nleading to infertility is very rare.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The image of the peripheral blood film shows atypical lymphocytes, also known as Downey cells. \nThe given clinical scenario along with characteristic atypical lymphocytes is suggestive \nof infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis, also called, glandular fever is caused by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). It is \ntransmitted person-to-person through salivary secretions and blood transfusion. The incubation \nperiod is 4 to 5 weeks. It presents with a classic triad of • Fever 344 \nSold by @itachibot • Pharyngitis • Lymphadenopathy Other clinical features include fatigue and hepatosplenomegaly. The patients are advised to avoid \ncontact sports for 3-4 weeks due to the risk of splenic rupture. The screening test of choice is the monospot test. This is a heterophile antibody test. Atypical \nlymphocytosis of &gt;10% is a characteristic laboratory finding. These are CD8 T lymphocytes that \ndevelop in response to the infected B lymphocytes. Other diseases caused by EBV include: • Hodgkin's lymphoma • Non-Hodgkin lymphoma • Burkitt's lymphoma • Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease • Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Option B: Kimura disease is s a chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that most \ncommonly presents as painless lymphadenopathy. Option C: Scrofuloderma is the result of cutaneous infection adjacent to a tuberculous focus, \nwhich may correspond to peripheral ganglionar tuberculosis (the most common form of \nextrapulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients and in children).",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of infantile diarrhea worldwide is rotavirus. Rotavirus causes diarrhea in children of 3-5 years of age, via the fecal-oral route. The incubation \nperiod is 1-3 days. Most cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms like watery diarrhea, \nvomiting, low-grade fever, and temporary lactose intolerance. This is presumably because of the \nprotection by maternal antibodies in breast milk. Diagnosis can be made by rapid antigen \ndetection of rotavirus in stool specimens Lactose intolerance is actually not very common in infants and typically only starts showing up \nafter age 3. All babies are born with lactase in their intestines. As they grow older, \nthe lactase enzyme decreases.",

Mother-to-child transmission of HBV can occur via the following three routes: • Intrauterine transmission • Transmission during delivery (most frequent method) 345 \nSold by @itachibot • Postpartum transmission Postpartum transmission: A proportion of babies may acquire the infection after birth due to close \ncontact with the mother. However, breastfeeding is not a risk factor for HBV infection. Transmission following amniocentesis has been described, but the risk appears low. Newborns born to seropositive Hepatitis B mothers are given Hep B immunoglobulin as well as \nHep B vaccination at birth.",

      "explanation": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare complication of measles. Hence, prior \ninfection with measles is most likely. SSPE occurs 3-8 years after a primary measles infection. It is the least common complication of \nmeasles but is almost always fatal. The clinical manifestations occur in 4 stages: Stage I: Maybe missed due to mild symptoms like irritability and reduced attention span. Stage II: Hallmark is massive Myoclonus. Involuntary muscle movements and myoclonic jerks \nstart from one group of muscles but gives way to massive spams and jerks. Stage III: Involuntary movements disappear and are replaced by choreoathetosis, immobility, \ndystonia, and lead-pipe rigidity due to destruction of deeper parts of basal ganglia. Stage IV: Loss of critical centers that lead to coma and then death. Diagnosis of SSPE is by: • Detection of measles antibody in CSF • Characteristic findings on EEG • Typical histological findings or/and isolation of virus or virus antigen from brain tissue obtained \nby biopsy or after postmortem.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given image shows small red lesions with bluish-white spots in the center on the inner aspects \nof the cheek opposite to the lower premolar, indicating the presence of Koplik spots. The \nappearance of these spots, along with a rash appearing three days later, strongly suggests a \ndiagnosis of measles. The measles virus is a single-stranded RNA virus. Measles infection has 4 phases: the incubation \nperiod, prodromal illness, exanthematous phase (characterized by the rash), and recovery phase. After an incubation period of 8-12 days, the prodromal phase of measles starts with mild fever and \nis followed by conjunctivitis, photophobia, coryza, cough, and increasing fever. Koplik spots, \nappearing 1-4 days prior to the rash, are a characteristic sign of measles. Symptoms gradually intensify over a period of 2-4 days until the first day of the rash. The rash \ntypically begins on the forehead (around the hairline), behind the ears, and on the upper neck as a \nred maculopapular eruption. It then spreads downward to the torso and extremities, often \nbecoming confluent on the face and upper trunk. Complications include acute otitis media (most common), pneumonia (the most common cause of \ndeath), croup, bronchiolitis, reactivation of tuberculosis, diarrhea, appendicitis, febrile seizures, \nand encephalitis. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare chronic complication of measles. Other options: Option B: Leukoplakia appears as a white patch in the oral cavity that cannot be wiped off. Option C: Scarlet fever is Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis and is characterized by a \ndistinctive sandpaper rash. The rash appears as a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruption \nthat turns the skin bright red and blanches on pressure. It starts around the neck and spreads to \nthe trunk and extremities. Option D: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium to \nlarge-sized vessels. It presents with fever, rash (maculopapular, erythema multiforme urticarial, or \nmicropustular), conjunctivitis, and cervical lymph node enlargement.",
