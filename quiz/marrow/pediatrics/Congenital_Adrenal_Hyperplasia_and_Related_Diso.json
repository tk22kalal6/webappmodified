      "explanation": "This child is most likely to have a 21-hydroxylase deficiency as it is the most common enzyme \ndeficiency implicated in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The second most common is 11 \nbeta-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase enzyme hydroxylates progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to yield \n11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively. They help in the synthesis of \naldosterone and cortisol. Therefore, the deficiency of this enzyme leads to the deficiencies of \naldosterone and cortisol. Also, the accumulated steroid precursors are diverted into the pathway for androgen \n(testosterone) production. 604 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical profile in 21-hydroxylase deficiency: • Aldosterone deficiency: Salt-wasting crises (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and \nmetabolic acidosis) • Cortisol deficiency: Hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation (due to increased ACTH production), \nweight loss, weakness, anorexia, vomiting, and shock • Androgens excess: Virilization of females and precocious puberty in males",

Depending on the extent of enzyme deficiency, CAH caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency is \nbroadly classified into classic and non-classic forms: Classic forms can be of two types - salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. • Salt-wasting type is the severe form in which both cortisol and aldosterone are deficient, with \nexcess androgen production. • In the simple virilizing type, there is an impaired synthesis of cortisol and adequate amounts of \naldosterone. Here, clinical features are due to the overproduction of androgens. The non-classic form is characterized by partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Cortisol and \naldosterone are produced normally, but at the expense of producing excess androgens.",

      "explanation": "614 \nSold by @itachibot The clinical scenario of hyperpigmentation, history of bilateral adrenalectomy and MRI showing \nenlarged pituitary adenoma points to the diagnosis of Nelson's syndrome. Nelson's syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is a \nprocedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary \nadenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases \nCRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the \noriginal pituitary tumor or formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: • Hyperpigmentation • Excessive ACTH secretion • Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regular \nintervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The \nprimary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid \nreplacement, as they do not produce cortisol. The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the need \nfor bilateral adrenalectomy these days. Option B: Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, also known as progressive supranuclear palsy \nis a neurodegenerative disease. It affects the brainstem and basal ganglia. Option C: Hamman-Rich syndrome also known as acute interstitial pneumonia, is a rare and \nsevere form of idiopathic interstitial lung disease. Option D: Job syndrome, also known as hyper-IgE syndrome is an autosomal dominant \nimmunodeficiency disorder. It occurs as a result of STAT3 mutation leading to deficiency in the \nIL-17 producing T cells. This results in impaired recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection.",

      "explanation": "The fetal adrenal gland produces a maximum amount of DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone). DHEA and DHEA-S serve as estrogen precursors. The maternal adrenal gland does not produce a \nsufficient amount of DHEA-S. The fetal adrenal glands are quantitatively the most important \nsource of placental estrogen precursors in pregnancy. During most of gestation, the fetal adrenal \ngland is almost solely dedicated to the production of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate DHEAS.",
