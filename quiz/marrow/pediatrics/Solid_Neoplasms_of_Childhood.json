Histopathology shows a tumor composed of small, round, blue cells and is characterized by \nHomer–Wright rosettes and an immunopositivity for synaptophysin. Standard treatment for medulloblastomas is surgical resection, with adjuvant craniospinal \nradiotherapy for those over 3 years of age and chemotherapy. Prognosis is strongly influenced by surgical resection, the presence of CSF metastases at the time \nof diagnosis, and the expression of the c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu) oncogene.
