Pendred syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder, caused by a mutation in the gene SLC26A4 \non chromosome 7, which codes for pendrin, a chloride–iodide transport protein common to the \nthyroid gland and the cochlea. Clinical features include sensorineural hearing loss and goitre with hypothyroidism. It is the most \ncommon cause of syndromic deafness. The biochemical reason for hypothyroidism in patients \nwith Pendred syndrome is impaired iodide organification (resulting from a mutation in the \nPendrin gene).",

      "explanation": "Newborn screening can fail to detect the affected twin with hypothyroidism. Discordance for thyroid dysgenesis is the rule in monozygotic twins. The transfusion of euthyroid \nblood from the unaffected twin normalizes the serum levels of T4 and TSH in the affected twin, \nresulting in delayed or missed diagnoses. Therefore, a second sample for congenital \nhypothyroidism screening at 14 days of age should be considered in monozygotic twins. Neonatal thyroid screening strategies: • Primarily TSH, backup T4; T4 is measured if TSH level is &gt;20 mU/L • Primarily T4, backup TSH: TSH is measured only if T4 level is low • Concomitant T4 and TSH; it is the most sensitive method Note: the sample is obtained after 24-48 hours, to minimize the false elevation of TSH values due \nto normal post-delivery neonatal TSH surge.",
