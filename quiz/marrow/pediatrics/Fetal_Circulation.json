      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Oxygenated blood is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein. The umbilical venous blood shunts via the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava. Thus, the \ninferior vena cava, which also carries blood from hepatic veins, kidneys, and from lower \nextremities carries a mixture of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. So, the highest percentage of \noxygen in the fetal circulation is in the umbilical vein, followed by the inferior vena cava. The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta for oxygenation. Note: In the umbilical cord, there are a pair of umbilical arteries and a single umbilical vein. Mnemonic: AVA- artery –vein- artery(2 arteries and a single vein).",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Blood in the inferior vena cava has a higher oxygen concentration compared to the superior vena \ncava. 451 \nSold by @itachibot The superior vena cava carries the deoxygenated blood from the upper part of the body to the \nright atrium. The highly oxygenated blood is carried to the fetus from the placenta via \nthe umbilical vein with 50% of the umbilical venous blood entering the hepatic circulation and the \nrest bypassing the liver and joining the inferior vena cava (IVC) via the ductus venosus. Hence, the \nblood in the inferior vena cava has a higher oxygen concentration compared to the superior vena \ncava. Also, relatively a larger percentage of oxygen-rich blood is perfused to the brain. Pressures in both the right and left ventricles are equal in a developing fetus. The upper part of \nthe body is perfused exclusively by the left ventricle while the lower extremities are perfused by \nthe right ventricle.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The total fetal cardiac output at term is approximately 450 mL/kg/min. Approximately 65% of descending aortic blood flow returns to the placenta, and hence, only the \nremaining 35% perfuses the fetal organs and tissues. The clinical relevance of this 65% blood flow being directed to the placenta comes in the context \nof delayed cord clamping vs early cord clamping after delivery. Delayed cord clamping entails the \numbilical cord is clamped more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has \nceased. This delayed clamping allows the blood flow between the placenta and neonate to \ncontinue and helps improve the iron status in the infant.",

      "explanation": "Oxygen is the most important factor controlling ductal closure. 454 \nSold by @itachibot Gestational age also appears to play an important role; the ductus of a premature infant is less \nresponsive to oxygen, even though its musculature is developed. Hence, patent ductus arteriosus \n(PDA) is more common in premature infants. The fetal circulatory adjustments after birth are given below: The patency of ductus arteriosus may either provide an alternative route for blood to bypass \ncongenital defects such as pulmonary atresia or coarctation of the aorta. Therapeutic medications can be used to either maintain the patency (prostaglandin E1) or \npromote closure (indomethacin).

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Alprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue, can be used to keep the ductus open medically in \nthe coarctation of the aorta. The ductus arteriosus (the fetal connection between the pulmonary artery and the descending \naorta) is functionally closed at 10-15hrs after birth and anatomically closed at 10-21 days after \nbirth. Survival of newborns with certain heart lesions such as coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left \nheart syndrome and transposition of great vessels depends on the patency of ductus arteriosus. \nClosure of PDA in such conditions can lead to hypoperfusion, severe hypoxia and cyanosis. PGE1 is a potent and specific relaxant of ductal smooth muscle. PGE1 analogues like alprostadil, \nmisoprost and rioprostil can be used to keep the ductus open and support systemic blood supply. In patent ductus arteriosus, the ductus is closed medically by NSAIDS (which inhibit \nprostaglandin synthesis) like ibuprofen trometamol/ ibuprofen lysine and indomethacin. \nMorphine can be used to manage respiratory distress but rarely preferred in a neonate.",
