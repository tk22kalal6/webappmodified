      "explanation": "From the given clinical picture of respiratory distress in a premature neonate and the X-ray \nfindings of diffuse ground-glass (reticulo-granular) opacities with a characteristic white-out \nappearance, hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is the most likely diagnosis. HMD, also known as neonatal Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a relatively common \ncondition resulting from insufficient production of surfactant that occurs in preterm neonates. \nMaternal diabetes, perinatal asphyxia, and multiple gestations are other known risk factors for the \ncondition. Clinical features include tachypnea, chest retractions, expiratory grunting, and nasal \nflaring. The infant may or may not be cyanosed. 410 \nSold by @itachibot X- ray features of HMD include: • Air bronchogram sign • Diffuse ground-glass opacities • Obliteration of cardiac and diaphragmatic contours giving rise to 'white-out' lung (indicates \nsevere disease) Chest radiograph (A) shows reticulogranular opacities throughout both lungs with prominent air \nbronchograms. The cardiac silhouette is preserved and both lungs are hypoaerated. Chest radiograph (B) shows more severe changes. There is obliteration of the cardiac and \ndiaphragmatic contours due to marked opacification, giving a complete ‘white out’ appearance",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "412 \nSold by @itachibot The lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio (L/S ratio) is an amniotic fluid test used to assess fetal lung \nmaturity. L/S ratio of &lt; 2 in amniotic fluid indicates lung immaturity. Surfactant starts appearing in the fetal lung by 20 weeks of gestation. Levels indicating lung \nmaturity are detected after 35 weeks. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates produced by type II \npneumocytes in the lung epithelium. The absence of surfactant in the liquid film lining the alveoli \ncauses an increase in surface tension and alveolar collapse. If not treated, such atelectasis leads to \nincreased work of breathing, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypoxia, \nand eventually respiratory failure. The relative concentration of the phospholipids lecithin (L) and sphingomyelin (S) is an indicator \nof lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amniotic \nfluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation when \nthe lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly the \nsame. An L–S ratio of 2.5 or more indicates fetal lung maturity while an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is \nassociated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. Other tests done to assess fetal lung maturity are: • Shake test/bubble test • Phosphatidyl glycerol measurement • Surfactant:albumin ratio • Lamellar body counts",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Nile blue test showing &gt;50% orange cells is a sign of fetal lung maturity, not blue cells. Tests for the assessment of fetal lung maturity include: The Nile blue test involves staining desquamated fetal cells from amniotic fluid with 0.1% Nile \nblue sulfate. The presence of orange cells &gt; 50% suggests lung \nmaturity. Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio at 31 to 32 weeks is 1, and at 35 weeks ratio is 2. The \nratio 2 indicates lung maturity (option A). The shake test or bubble test (Clement's test) (option B) involves mixing amniotic fluid with 95% \nethanol, shaking it for 15 seconds, and observing it for 15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles at \nthe meniscus is a positive test and indicates lung maturity. This is a useful bedside test. The presence of phosphatidylglycerol, (option C) saturated phosphatidylcholine and lamellar body \ncount (&gt;50,000/mcL) indicates lung maturity. Glucocorticoids accelerate lung maturation and lower the incidence of respiratory distress and \nneonatal mortality in preterms if the birth was delayed for at least 24 hours after initiation of \nbetamethasone. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for women between 24 and 36 \nweeks who are at risk of delivery within 7 days. Intramuscular injections of either 2 doses of 12 mg \nbetamethasone are given 24 hourly or 4 doses of 6 mg dexamethasone are given 12 hourly. 413 \nSold by @itachibot",

The infant has presented with moderate respiratory distress without any \nsigns of respiratory failure so early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the appropriate \ntreatment. CPAP started at birth is the choice for the management of a preterm infant at risk for respiratory \ndistress syndrome (RDS). Early nasal CPAP has shown to lower mortality and risk of \nbronchopulmonary dysplasia. Room air is better than oxygen for the resuscitation of preterm \ninfants, and 100% oxygen is also harmful, causing increased oxidative stress. The intubate-surfactant-extubate (INSURE) on CPAP technique is recommended for surfactant \nadministration when babies showed signs of RDS and needed more than 30% inspired oxygen to \nmaintain saturation in the normal range.",

The \naspirated meconium can block the large and small airways, causing patchy atelectasis and \nemphysema. This produces a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Severe overinflation can lead to air \nleak syndromes such as pneumothorax. Meconium consists of water, desquamated GIT cells, skin, lanugo hair, vernix, bile salts, \npancreatic enzymes, lipids, and mucopolysaccharides. The bile salts and pancreatic enzymes can \ncause chemical pneumonitis. Meconium can also cause surfactant inactivation by displacing it \nfrom the alveolar surface and inhibiting its surface tension-lowering ability. Severe MAS is \nassociated with remodelling and thickening of the muscular walls, resulting in pulmonary \nhypertension. Infants who develop MAS typically present in the first 12 hours after birth with varying degrees of \nrespiratory distress. On inspection, many affected infants have 'barrel chests'; crackles (rales) and \nrhonchi often can be heard on auscultation. In severe cases, the entire lungs can be involved \nresulting in a total “whiteout” of the lungs on the radiograph.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is not a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is defined as cessation of breathing for longer than 20 seconds or for any duration if \naccompanied by cyanosis or bradycardia. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is seen in preterm \ninfants and usually resolves by the 37th week of gestation. Recurrent apnea of prematurity may be \ntreated with caffeine or theophylline. It does not predict the future occurrence of SIDS. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year of age, \nwhich remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including the performance of a \ncomplete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.",

      "explanation": "The organism most likely to cause the mentioned infections is Chlamydia trachomatis. Pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis can develop in 10–20% of infants born to women with \nactive, untreated chlamydial infection. Only approximately 25% of infants with nasopharyngeal \nchlamydial infection develop pneumonia. C. trachomatis pneumonia of infancy has a very characteristic presentation. It usually occurs \nbetween 1-3 months of age and is insidious, with a persistent cough, tachypnea, and absence of \nfever. Auscultation reveals rales; wheezing is uncommon. The absence of fever and wheezing helps to distinguish C. trachomatis pneumonia from \nrespiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. A distinctive laboratory finding is the presence of peripheral eosinophilia (&gt;400 cells/µL). The most consistent finding on chest radiograph is hyperinflation accompanied by minimal \ninterstitial or alveolar infiltrates.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Once the diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is made or suspected, all patients are \nintubated. Also a nasogastric tube, connected to continuous suction, is placed in the stomach to \nreduce lung compression. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm. The most common \ntype of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia (postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia); other types include \nMorgagni hernia (anterior-parasternal), diaphragm eventration, and central tendon defects of the \ndiaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest \ncavity, hindering proper lung formation and expansion. Immediate steps of management: Endotracheal intubation  Placement of a nasogastric tube  Administration of fluids and \ninotropic agents  Administration of surfactant therapy to only preterm infants with findings \nsuggestive of respiratory distress syndrome.Other options: Option B: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided as they lead to gastric/abdominal distension \nand compression of the lung. Option C: Both arterial and central venous lines are inserted; however, this is not the first line of \nintervention. 420 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: To support respiratory failure, the first modality to be used is conventional ventilation, \nand if there is no improvement, then high-frequency ventilation is used.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture of neonatal respiratory distress, absent breath sounds in the left side of \nthe chest, and an X-ray image showing bowel loops in the thoracic cavity is diagnostic of \ncongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Though less commonly documented, dextrocardia is seen \nin association with CDH. A diaphragmatic hernia is defined as a communication between the abdominal and thoracic \ncavities with or without abdominal contents in the thorax. It is mostly congenital, with a defective \nformation of the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Females are affected twice as often as males. Bochdalek hernia accounts for up to 90% of the hernias seen in the newborn period, with 80-90% \noccurring on the left side. So, the heart will be pushed to the right side (dextroposition). Predictors of a poor prognosis include an associated major anomaly, symptoms before completion \nof 24 hours since birth, severe pulmonary hypoplasia, herniation to the contralateral lung, and the \nneed for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator. It reduces ductal shunting and pulmonary \npressures, resulting in improved oxygenation. 421 \nSold by @itachibot Childhood Respiratory Disorders",
