Clinical findings in TOF: • Right ventricular hypertrophy causing left anterior hemithorax bulge. • Single S2 or soft P2 because of the stenotic pulmonary valve • Systolic thrill in the left sternal border in 3rd and 4th parasternal spaces. • The large 'a' wave in the jugular pulse is a reflection of the forceful contraction of the right \natrium at the end of diastole as there is reduced distensibility of the hypertrophic right ventricle. • There is a loud and harsh systolic murmur due to the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) \nobstruction.

In the tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), we see concentric right ventricular hypertrophy without cardiac \nenlargement. It is because of pulmonary stenosis (PS) and the ventricular septal defect (VSD). Any \nbuild-up of pressure in the right ventricle due to PS is released through VSD to the left ventricle. Option A: P2 is of low intensity and soft because the right ventricular outflow obstruction results \nin reduced pulmonary artery pressure.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Isoprenaline/isoproterenol should be avoided in tet or hypercyanotic spells. It will cause \na decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). So, more \nblood leaves the left ventricle leading to the increased right to left shunt. This results in the \nworsening of right ventricular outflow and causes worsening of cyanosis and the symptoms. Treatment of hypercyanotic spell involves placing child in knee–chest position (or squatting), and \nuse of: • oxygen • morphine - sedates the patient • sodium bicarbonate - to counteract metabolic acidosis that develops when arterial Po2 &lt;40 \nmmHg • alpha-agonists (phenylephrine)- vasopressor used in severe cases • beta-blockers (propranolol)- improves resting saturation and decreases the frequency of spells. Drugs that increase SVR, such as IV phenylephrine (alpha-1 agonist) or propranolol (non-selective \nbeta-antagonist/beta-2 block), can improve right ventricular outflow, decrease the right-to-left \nshunt, and improve the symptoms.

      "explanation": "This baby has a cyanotic congenital heart disease that is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus. \nProstaglandin E1 infusion prevents the closure of PDA in term neonates with duct-dependent 498 \nSold by @itachibot congenital heart disease (CHD). Cyanosis failing to improve with 100% oxygen suggests an underlying cyanotic CHD. Functional closure of the PDA occurs soon after birth, usually within first week of life. The open PDA acted as a conduit between systemic and pulmonary circulations, thereby \npreventing the onset of cyanosis. Upon its closure, cyanosis manifested in the baby as the blood could not be pumped into the lungs \nfor oxygenation. Deoxygenated blood is being shunted into the systemic circulation after the \nclosure of PDA. Hence, you should maintain the patency of the duct with PGE1 infusion until \nsurgery can be done. Duct-dependent lesions: Anomalies, in a newborn with CHD, which are dependent on the patency \nof ductus arteriosus for survival. • Right-sided lesions (Tetralogy of Fallot, PA/PS) cannot pump blood to the lungs. These patients \nare dependent on an open PDA for pulmonary circulation. • Left-sided lesions (Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Aortic stenosis, Coarctation of aorta) cannot \npump blood into the systemic circulation. These patients are dependent on open PDA for systemic \ncirculation.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given chest x-ray shows 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart, which is seen in tetralogy of \nFallot (TOF). The characteristic silhouette is due to cardiac apex elevation as a result of right ventricular \nhypertrophy. The hilar areas and lung fields are relatively clear because of diminished pulmonary \nblood flow or the small size of the pulmonary arteries and the aorta is usually enlarged. The image below describes the likeness of the cardiac silhouette to a boot: TOF is cyanotic congenital heart disease with the following four components: • Obstruction to right ventricular outflow (pulmonary stenosis) • Malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (VSD) • Dextroposition of the aorta so that it overrides the ventricular septum (overriding of the aorta) • Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of the right ventricular outflow obstruction. In \nmild degrees, the symptoms become pronounced as the baby grows due to RV infundibular \nhypertrophy and may present with heart failure. In severe degrees, pulmonary blood flow \npredominantly depends on the ductus arteriosus. As soon as the duct closes, the baby presents \nwith cyanosis and circulatory collapse in the neonatal period. Clinical features include significant hypercyanotic spells in infants which are characterised by \nhyperpnea, cyanosis, and gasping followed by syncope. The spells occur most frequently in the \nmorning on initially awakening or after episodes of vigorous crying. These spells are due to a \nprolonged reduction of pulmonary blood flow resulting in severe systemic hypoxia and metabolic \nacidosis. Older children present with exertional dyspnea and assume a squatting position to relieve the \ndyspneic episode after which the child is able to resume the activity. 500 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given chest x-ray shows an egg-on-string appearance seen in the transposition of great \narteries (TGA). Enlargement of the left atrium is seen in TGA, not the right atrium. The reason for left atrial enlargement is due to increased pulmonary blood flow. TGA is characterized by the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from \nthe left ventricle. This abnormal configuration leads to a narrow vascular pedicle. As pulmonary vascular resistance drops during the first few days of life, blood flow through the \npulmonary vasculature is increased. There is also elevated pulmonary venous pressure seen in \nTGA, especially in infants with an intact interventricular septum. The globular (egg) appearance of the heart due to abnormal convexity of the right atrial border \nand left atrial enlargement, and the narrow superior mediastinum (string) result in the classical \negg-on-string appearance. TGA is the most specific heart disease in infants of diabetic mothers. Early management includes an immediate infusion of prostaglandin E1 which keeps the ductus \narteriosus patent for improving oxygenation. Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy is a palliative \ncatheter-based intervention that can be done to improve the hypoxic state before definitive \nsurgery. The procedure creates an opening in the atrial septum which allows better \ninter-circulatory mixing of the blood. Jatene arterial switch procedure is the definitive surgery. Most infants with TGA do not survive till adulthood without corrective surgery.",
