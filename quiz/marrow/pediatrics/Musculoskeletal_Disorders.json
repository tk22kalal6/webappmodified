      "question": "Question 1: A 3-year-old child is brought to the clinic because of walking difficulties. His mother says he \nhas always walked on his toes and walks by tilting side-to-side. He also has progressive \nmuscle weakness. There is no history of trauma, fever, or rash. On examination, calf \nhypertrophy with atrophied thigh muscles is noted as shown below. There is no tenderness on \npalpation. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
        "b": "Myotonic dystrophy",
        "c": "Spinal muscular atrophy",
        "d": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The finding of enlarged calf muscles and atrophied thigh muscles with a history of muscle \nweakness and waddling gait are suggestive of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease. It is \nan X-linked recessive disorder. In DMD, pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles which occurs due \nto muscle enlargement by the infiltration of fat. It is paradoxically weak, unlike the muscle that \nenlarges due to hypertrophy. Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles is the characteristic feature of \nDMD, whereas the other 3 conditions mentioned in the options do not have this feature. Clinical features: • Progressive weakness with developmental delay • Pseudohypertrophy of calves • Wasting of thigh muscles • Characteristic Trendelenburg gait or hip waddle. • Gower’s sign • Dilated cardiomyopathy Diagnosis: • Elevated serum creatine kinase levels • Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for dystrophin gene 697 \nSold by @itachibot • If PCR is normal, but clinical suspicion is high, muscle biopsy with dystrophin \nimmunocytochemistry is done. Treatment includes supportive management for cardiac decompensation, nutritional \nmanagement, physiotherapy, and glucocorticoids. Death usually occurs by 18 to 20 years of age \ndue to respiratory failure, intractable heart failure, pneumonia, or aspiration. Note- The FDA has approved Vamorolone, a novel corticosteroid for the treatment of DMD. The \ndrug offers enhanced anti-inflammatory properties and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism as \nwell. It is potentially a safer and more effective alternative to glucocorticoids. Other options: Option B: Myotonic dystrophy presents with distal muscle weakness, proximal muscle \ninvolvement is very late. Option C: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), type 1 (which is most common) presents in infancy. \nDeath occurs early. Option D: Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy presents with predominant involvement of \nscapular and humeral muscles. The given question describes the involvement of lower limb \nmuscles. Hence, Emery–Dreifuss dystrophy, in this case, is less likely.",

      "explanation": "The structure marked as B in the image represents dystrophin protein (a sarcolemmal protein), \nwhich is absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to a mutation in the dystrophin \ngene. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X near the p21 locus (Xp21).

An early Gowers \nsign is often evident by age of 3 years and is fully expressed by age of 5 or 6 years. This maneuver can be seen in patients with: • Duchenne muscular dystrophy • Becker's muscular dystrophy • Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy • Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy • Polymyositis • Dermatomyositis 699 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The image shows winging of the scapula, which when combined with this patient's features are \nsuggestive of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition that generally presents with \nasymmetric weakness in facial and shoulder girdle muscles. Occasionally, finger and wrist \nweakness is the first symptom. The mouth is rounded and appears puckered because of the protruding lips. Upper facial \nweakness will manifest as an inability to close the eyes completely in sleep. Scapular winging is \nprominent, even in infants. Flattening or even concavity of the deltoid contour is seen, and the \nbiceps and triceps brachii muscles are wasted and weak. Eventually, proximal muscles get \ninvolved and undergo atrophy, and Gowers sign &amp; Trendelenburg gait appear. Lumbar \nlordosis, foot drop, and kyphoscoliosis are common complications. Treatment includes orthopedic measures for scoliosis and foot drop, surgical intervention for \nscapular deformity. Physiotherapy has no value. Other options: Long thoracic nerve palsy: No history of trauma or surgery rules out this diagnosis. Klippel-Feil syndrome: Classic triad of Klippel–Feil syndrome (congenital musculoskeletal \ncondition) • low posterior hairline • short neck • decreased cervical range of motion Myotonic dystrophy patients have a characteristic V-shaped upper lip, a history of myotonia, and \nprogressive weakness. 700 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Dermatomyositis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical picture showing pain in the calves occuring within a week of an upper respiratory \ntract infection (URI), with elevated creatine kinase levels suggests the diagnosis of viral myositis. \nThe specific history of URI suggests influenza myositis. Infectious myositis has a male predominance and is typically seen in young adults. Childhood \nform presents with fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea and is usually followed by severe pain, \nespecially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms last \nfor about a week. In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of the \ninvolvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles. Other viral causes of myositis include HIV-1 (one of the most common causes of myositis), group \nB coxsackievirus (epidemic myalgia), HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus), and \ncytomegalovirus (CMV). Lab features of influenza myositis include elevated CK which may be as high as 500 times normal \nthe value. Urine myoglobin is usually positive. Detection of the virus with PCR testing of \nnasopharyngeal specimens can be carried out but is not of much clinical significance. The \nhistopathological examination would reveal muscle fiber necrosis without much inflammatory \nchange. Treatment includes bed rest, IV fluids, and symptomatic management with analgesics and \nantipyretics. Amantadine and other antiviral agents may be considered in adults. Complications \ninclude myocarditis and respiratory dysfunction. Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon complication.",

        "d": "Emery-Dreifuss syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, only Spinal muscular atrophy presents in infancy. The rest present in \nlate childhood. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative disease of motor neurons, that is inherited in \nan autosomal recessive manner. It usually starts in infancy with hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and thin \nmuscle mass (atrophy). Polyhydramnios may be present prenatally due to weakness in \nswallowing. Diagnosis is done by genetic testing for SMN gene mutation. Muscle biopsy is done for cases with \nnegative genetic testing and strong clinical suspicion. The muscle biopsy in infancy shows a \ncharacteristic pattern of perinatal denervation that is unlike that of a mature muscle. Groups of \ngiant type I fibers are mixed with fascicles of severely atrophic fibers. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recent updates: • Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide approved by the FDA for treating SMA. It is \nadministered intrathecally. • Risdiplam (first oral drug) has been approved by FDA to treat infants &gt;2 months of age with \nSMA. It is an oral splicing modifier that corrects the splicing defect of SMN2, which leads to 701 \nSold by @itachibot increased levels of full-length SMN protein.",

      "explanation": "A maculopapular rash over the metacarpophalangeal joints is indicative of Gottron papules in a \nchild with proximal muscle weakness is suggestive of juvenile dermatomyositis. As it is an \ninflammatory myopathy, the next investigation is serum creatine kinase. Though the gold standard investigation is a muscle biopsy, it is indicated only when the diagnosis \nis in doubt or when grading of the disease severity is required. Nerve conduction studies are \nusually normal unless associated with severe muscle necrosis and atrophy.
