      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Respiratory effort, not rate is a component of Apgar score. The Apgar score is an objective method of evaluating the newborn's condition using the 5 \nparameters explained below. It is performed at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. • Color (A, appearance) • Heart rate (P, pulse) • Response to a catheter in nostril (G, grimace) • Muscle tone (A, activity) • Respiratory effort (R) Apgar score is not used to guide resuscitation, and resuscitation must be initiated before the \n1-minute score. The change of score at sequential time points following birth reflects how well the 60 \nSold by @itachibot baby is responding to resuscitative efforts.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The Apgar score in this baby is 4. It is calculated as: Appearance: blue - score 0 Pulse: &lt;100 beats/min - score 1 Grimace: with minimal response to stimulation - score 1 Activity: some flexion of the extremities - score 1 Respiratory effort: irregular - score 1 The total score is 4. Apgar score is not used to guide resuscitation, and resuscitation must be initiated before the \n1-minute score. The change of score at sequential time points following birth reflects how well the \nbaby is responding to resuscitative efforts. Causes for low Apgar score are: • Fetal distress • Prematurity • Drugs like analgesics, narcotics, sedatives, magnesium sulfate • Acute cerebral trauma • Precipitous delivery • Airway obstruction (choanal atresia) • Congenital pneumonia or sepsis • Haemorrhage- hypovolemia False-negative Apgar score is seen in maternal acidosis and high fetal catecholamine levels. A total score of 10 indicates that the infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with a score \nof 0-3 requires immediate resuscitation. If the score at 5 minutes remains less than 7, the infant \nshould be assessed again every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes. 61 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "During neonatal resuscitation, the mouth is suctioned first and then the nares, in order \nto decrease the risk of aspiration. A 12 or 14 French suction catheter is used, with the suction \npressure kept between 80-100 mmHg. Routine suctioning of the trachea during neonatal resuscitation is not recommended. \nThe suctioning of the esophagus and stomach is avoided if not indicated specifically. It may \nproduce a vagal response - apnea and/or bradycardia due to stimulation of the nerve in the \nposterior pharynx.",

A 3:1 compression-to-ventilation ratio is used for neonatal resuscitation where compromise of gas \nexchange is nearly always the primary cause of the cardiovascular collapse. Chest compressions are indicated if the heart rate is below 60/min even after 30 seconds of \npositive pressure ventilation.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Room air is the preferred initial gas for neonatal resuscitation in term infants. Resuscitation with room air in term infants is as effective as using 100% oxygen. By using room \nair, we may reduce the risk of hyperoxia which is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow \nand generation of oxygen free radicals. If the neonate does not achieve normal oxygen saturation levels within 90 seconds, increased \nconcentrations of oxygen are administered until normal saturation levels are achieved. If pulmonary hypertension is suspected (meconium aspiration, diaphragmatic hernia), one may \nconsider 100% oxygen as the initial gas for resuscitation. Resuscitation of most preterm infants \ncan be initiated with a slightly higher fraction of inspired oxygen (21–30%). 64 \nSold by @itachibot",

A newborn is defined as \nnon-vigorous if any of the above three signs are absent. Resuscitation of non-vigorous newborns with meconium-stained amniotic fluid includes \npositive-pressure ventilation and in severe cases, endotracheal intubation and chest compressions.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most important immediate management is to maintain adequate ventilation via bag and \nmask, because the baby is apneic. Meperidine is a narcotic and the administration of narcotics such as opioids or barbiturates, to \nthe mother shortly before delivery (within 4 hours prior) result in narcosis and respiratory \ndepression in the newborn. In these babies, naloxone hydrochloride is given while adequate ventilation (bag and mask) is \nmaintained. Breathing in the depressed infant should be maintained until a response to naloxone \nis noted. Naloxone hydrochloride, 0.1 mg/kg, can be given intravenously or intramuscularly.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ex-utero intrapartum treatment procedure (EXIT) is a procedure by which the airway is secured \nbefore the infant is separated from the placenta. It allows time to secure the airway in an infant known to have airway obstruction due to various \ncauses, including laryngeal atresia or stenosis, teratomas, hygromas, and oral tumors before the \ninfant is separated from the placenta. Uteroplacental gas exchange is maintained throughout the \nprocedure. Option A: BiPAP machines provide positive airway pressure during exhalation and additional \npositive pressure during inspiration. It allows for adjusting of inspiratory and expiratory \npressures. The additional pressures augment tidal volume and improve alveolar ventilation. \nChildren with neuromuscular weakness and intrathoracic airway obstruction benefit from this. Option C: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass \nthat augments systemic perfusion and provides gas exchange. This may be helpful to prevent and \ntreat hypoxia and respiratory acidosis and decrease the work of breathing in ARDS, central apnea, \nrefractory shock, severe sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, etc. 66 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: CPAP is provided via a high-flow nasal cannula, with a gas flow of 4-16 L/min.
