It affects the bones, skin, and several endocrine tissues. Fibrous dysplasia of multiple bones (polyostotic) represents a major cause of morbidity in this \nsyndrome. The base of the skull and the proximal femurs are most commonly involved, but any \nbone can be affected. A CT scan is usually recommended even in absence of deformities.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia/adrenogenital syndrome is a family of autosomal-recessive \ndisorders caused by the deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones in \nthe adrenal cortex. The majority of cases of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This \ndeficiency leads to a lack of synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in the salt-wasting \nform of the disease, which is the most severe form. Severe 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with symptoms including weight loss, dehydration, \nweakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Accumulated steroid precursors like 638 \nSold by @itachibot 17-hydroxyprogesterone, are shunted into the pathway of androgen synthesis leading to elevated \nlevels of androstenedione and testosterone. This can result in abnormal genital development in \naffected female fetuses during early gestation. Females may have masculinized external genitalia.
