      "explanation": "The given image shows an abnormally short lingual frenulum called Ankyloglossia. Ankyloglossia is also called “tongue-tie” due to an abnormally short lingual frenulum that can \nhinder tongue movement. It can interfere with speech or feeding. In such cases, surgical \ncorrection is indicated. The image below shows tongue tie and the classic W-shaped appearance of the tongue on \nprotrusion: Fissured tongue (Option C) (scrotal tongue or lingua plicata) is a benign malformation in which \nnumerous small furrows or deep grooves are present on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Food \nparticles and debris may become trapped in the fissures, resulting in irritation, inflammation, and \nhalitosis. Macroglossia (Option D), or an abnormally large tongue, may be seen in disorders like Down's \nsyndrome, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, Hurler's syndrome, and cretinism.",

      "explanation": "Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, an electrolyte and acid-base imbalance \ncharacteristically seen in congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS). A pH of 7.55 indicates alkalosis and plasma HCO3- is 30 mmol/L, which is in the higher range. \nBoth these findings indicate metabolic alkalosis. Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality. \ni.e Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. • Persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development \nof metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-). • Kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3-. However, loss of sodium \nstimulates the secretion of aldosterone through the RAAS pathway. • The aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions. • Loss of potassium ions leads to the development of hypokalemia. • Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It is \ncalled paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead of \ncompensating for that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine. CHPS typically presents with the following: • Non-bilious vomiting, which is progressive, maybe projectile, occurring immediately after a feed, \nusually presents after the 3rd week of age. • As the vomiting continues, a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ions, chloride ions, and \npotassium leads to hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Hyperbilirubinemia is the most common clinical association of pyloric stenosis, which is also \nknown as the icteropyloric syndrome.",

      "explanation": "The presence of non-bilious vomiting and visible gastric peristalsis is highly suggestive of \ncongenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis is \nultrasound. CHPS is associated with hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus resulting in constriction \nand obstruction of the gastric outlet. It is common between 3-6 weeks of age. First-born male \ninfants are at the highest risk. Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting. Clinically, an olive-shaped mass is \npalpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. When the infant is given a test feed, visible \nperistalsis is usually observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. The \ncharacteristic metabolic abnormality is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to recurrent \nvomiting. Ultrasound features: • Double-layered hypertrophic mucosa protrudes into the stomach, creating the so-called ‘Nipple \nsign’ • The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervix \nand is sometimes referred to as the ‘cervix sign’ • The diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis are a muscle thickness of 4 mm and a pyloric length \nof 16 mm If ultrasound is inconclusive, contrast studies (barium) are performed, which demonstrate • An elongated pyloric channel (string sign), • A bulge of the pyloric muscle into the antrum (shoulder sign), and • Parallel streaks of barium seen in the narrowed channel, producing a “double tract sign.” The image attached below shows the USG findings in CHPS. 362 \nSold by @itachibot Signs in Congenital Pyloric stenosis: Sign String sign \nPassing of small streak of bar \nium through pyloric canal Double/triple track sign \nCrowding of muscle folds in \npyloric canal Diamond sign/twining recess \nTransient triangular tent like \ncleft in mid portion of pyloric \ncanal with apex pointing infe \nriorly.

      "explanation": "The diagnosis in the above case is a urachal fistula. The clinical vigentte suggesting straw -yellow \nfluid (suggestive of urine) along with secondary infection (mildly elevated temperature) and \npresence of fluid only on straining are all suggestive of urahcal fistula. The urachus is an embryologic canal connecting the dome of the fetal bladder with the allantois, a \nstructure that contributes to the formation of the umbilical cord. In this condition, there is \ncontinuous urinary drainage from the umbilicus on straining. It usually presents as a tender, \nswollen mass secondary to infection. Diagnosis is made by ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT). Definitive management is surgical resection of the tract. A patent vitellointestinal duct, patent omphalomesenteric duct and bladder diverticulum will \ncause umbilical discharge even in the absence of straining.

      "question": "Question 18: A full-term neonate was found to have distention of the abdomen. He also passed his \nmeconium late and based on further workup was later diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease. \nWhich of the following conditions is least likely to be found in association with this?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Von Recklinghausen's disease",
        "b": "Joubert syndrome",
        "c": "Edward syndrome",
        "d": "Downs syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Hirschsprung disease is not associated with Edward syndrome (trisomy 18). It is associated with: • Trisomy 21/ Downs syndrome • Joubert syndrome • Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome • Shah–Waardenburg syndrome • Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 syndrome • Neurofibromatosis (Von recklinghausen disease) 367 \nSold by @itachibot • Neuroblastoma • Urogenital or cardiovascular abnormalities. Hirschsprung disease or congenital aganglionic colon is characterized by the absence of ganglion \ncells in the submucosal and myenteric plexus. It is more common in males. Risk factors include \nDown's syndrome and RET oncogene. The imaging modality of choice in Hirschsprung's disease is a contrast radiograph \nwith barium or gastrograffin enema (image shown above). The most important film is a lateral or oblique view of the rectum during slow filling. It typically \nshows a low bowel obstruction. The rectum is seen as a narrow tube and a cone-shaped transition \nzone, seen proximal to the dilated ganglionated bowel. A rectal suction biopsy is a gold standard for the diagnosis and operative intervention is the \ndefinitive treatment. Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows: • Swenson procedure, where aganglionic bowel is removed and a coloanal anastomosis is \nperformed. • Duhamel procedure, where the aganglionic rectal stump is left in place and the ganglionated \nnormal colon is pulled posterior. • Soave procedure: In this procedure, endorectal mucosal dissection is done within the aganglionic \ndistal rectum and then the ganglionated normal colon is pulled through the remnant muscular \ncuff, and a coloanal anastomosis is performed. NOTE: In the fetus, migration of the neuronal crest tissues to form myenteric plexus and ganglion cells is \ncompleted by the 24th week of life. If interrupted in migration, it results in Hirschsprung disease.",

      "explanation": "368 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical vignette is suggestive of imperforate anus in a neonate with VACTERL \nassociation (presence of vertebral and renal anomalies in addition to the anal \natresia). Lymphedema is not a component of VACTERL syndrome. VACTERL association is a disorder that affects many-body systems. People diagnosed \nwith VACTERL association typically have at least three of the following characteristic features. Components of VACTERL association: • Vertebral • Anorectal • Cardiac • Tracheal • Esophageal • Renal • Radial • Limb anomalies Anorectal malformations: • It occurs due to the post-allantoic gut with the proctodaeum. • Newborns classically present with inability to pass meconium within 48 hours, abdominal \ndistention, intestinal obstruction, improper anal dimple, and sometimes with complaints of \npassing meconium per urethra. Wingspread Classification: • Low - Below the level of the pelvic floor (puborectalis). • Intermediate - Occurs at the level of the puborectalis with or without fistula. • High - Anorectal agenesis, rectal atresia. Investigations: • Wangenstein's invertogram is done 6-12 hours after birth with a metal coin strapped to the \npresumed site of the anus. The X-ray taken is used to measure and classify the deformity. • USG abdomen • Imaging to evacuate associated abnormalities Treatment is surgical.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In this case, the most likely cause of rectal prolapse would be Trichuriasis. It is common in poor \nrural communities with inadequate sanitary facilities and soil contaminated with human or \nanimal feces. The highest infection rate occurs among children between 5-15 years. 369 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical manifestations include chronic dysentery, anemia, poor growth, and developmental \ndeficits. In heavy infections, adult worms can extend throughout the colon down to the rectum. \nOver time, inflammation of the rectum causes tenesmus leading to prolapse. Other options: Pertussis would present with cough, low-grade fever, and sneezing. Increased abdominal pressure \ndue to the persistent cough could cause a prolapse. Chronic constipation is unlikely as the child has a history of frequently soiling his pants, \nsuggestive of dysentery. Cystic fibrosis would manifest much earlier in life with respiratory symptoms like recurrent \npneumonia. These children have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, causing protein and fat \nmalabsorption. This leads to bulky, greasy stools and eventually a prolapse if untreated. 370 \nSold by @itachibot Medical GI disorders",
