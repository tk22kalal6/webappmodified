      "explanation": "The risk of death from diarrhoea is increased in the presence of deficiencies of micronutrients \nsuch as vitamin A, and zinc (2 and 4 only). Both these micronutrients are essential for maintaining mucosal immunity. Vitamin A deficiency \nincreases mortality from diarrhoea, measles, and malaria while Zinc deficiency increases mortality \nfrom diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria.

Diarrhoea is defined as • stool volume of more than 10 g/kg/day in toddlers/infants (or) • stool volume greater than 200 g/day in older children Persistent diarrhoea is increasingly observed in children with malnutrition. These are due to \ninfections commonly caused due to enteroadherent Escherichia coli and Aeromonas.

      "explanation": "The clinical vignette is suggestive of acquired lactose intolerance which is an example of osmotic \ndiarrhoea. Lactose is present in milk and dairy products. If it is not absorbed in the small intestine, it reaches \nthe colon, where it is fermented to short-chain organic acids. This releases hydrogen that can be \ndetected in the lactose breath test and also generates an osmotic overload. 377 \nSold by @itachibot The child with lactose intolerance generally has perianal excoriations. The condition is diagnosed \nby using stool examination which shows acidic stool positive for reducing substances. Treatment \nis by diet control using a diet devoid of lactose. It can be congenital due to lactase deficiency or \nacquired after post-viral gastroenteritis. In secretory diarrhoea, the epithelial cells’ ion transport \nprocesses are turned into a state of active secretion. The most common cause of acute-onset \nsecretory diarrhoea is a bacterial infection of the gut. Chronic diarrhoea is, in many cases, the result of an intestinal infection that persists longer than \nexpected. Dysentery/Shigellosis is a type of food poisoning caused by infection with the Shigella species. It is \nspread by means of faeco-oral transmission.",

      "explanation": "Isotonic dehydration with acidosis is the most common finding in children with severe viral \nenteritis. Viruses that cause human diarrhoea selectively infect and destroy the villus tip cells in the small \nintestine. In the small intestine, the upper villus enterocytes are differentiated cells, which have absorptive \nfunctions, such as the transport of water and electrolytes. On the other hand, the crypt \nenterocytes are undifferentiated cells and are net secretors of water and electrolytes. 379 \nSold by @itachibot Selective viral infection of intestinal villus tip cells thus leads to decreased absorption of salt and \nwater (proportionate loss of water and salt—isotonic dehydration) and an imbalance in the ratio \nof intestinal fluid absorption to secretion. Metabolic acidosis may be a result of stool bicarbonate losses in children with diarrhoea. These \ncan also be seen due to secondary renal insufficiency or lactic acidosis as a sequelae to diarrhoea.",
