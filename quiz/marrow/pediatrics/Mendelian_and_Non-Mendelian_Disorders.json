This is characteristically seen in \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy, which is an X-linked recessive disorder. Salient features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: • Most common hereditary neuromuscular disease. • X-linked recessive mutations of dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. Clinical features: • Progressive weakness, developmental delay, and intellectual impairment • In toddlers: delayed walking, falling, toe walking, and trouble running or walking upstairs • Common sites of muscular hypertrophy: calf &gt; tongue &gt; forearm • Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles due to fibrofatty replacement of muscle • Gower's sign: Patients use their arms and hands to walk up their own body from a squatting \nposition due to the reduced strength in the proximal muscles(hip &amp;thigh) of the lower limbs. • Trendelenburg gait/hip waddle • Inability to walk develops by the age of 10-14 years. • Complications: Contractures, scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, malignant hyperthermia after \nanaesthesia. • Death occurs by 3rd decade of life due to respiratory failure. Note: Becker's Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) vs. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Mnemonic- • BMD: Badly makes dystrophin (defective) • DMD: Does not make dystrophin (absent) 206 \nSold by @itachibot",
