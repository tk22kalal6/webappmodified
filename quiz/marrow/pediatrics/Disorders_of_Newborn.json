This incompatibility between the mother and fetus generally results in milder disease than Rh \nincompatibility does. It arises when a mother with blood group type O becomes pregnant with a fetus of different blood \ntype (A/B). The mother's serum contains naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B, which can cross \nthe placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs. Although antibodies against A and B factors occur without previous immunization (natural \nantibodies), they are usually IgM, which do not cross the placenta.

Asymptomatic \nneonates can be managed conservatively with early nutrition. Symptomatic neonates should \nreceive iv or oral calcium replacement.

Respiratory distress syndrome, macrosomia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, renal vein \nthrombosis, visceromegaly, heart failure, and persistent pulmonary hypertension are other \nfeatures seen in infants of diabetic mothers. Congenital anomalies are seen in infants of mothers with pregestational diabetes. Neural tube \ndefects (Encephalocele, meningomyelocele, anencephaly), transposition of great vessels (TGA), \nventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis \nand coarctation of the aorta are commonly seen. Caudal regression syndrome is rare, but a specific anomaly seen in infants of diabetic mothers. \nSmall left colon syndrome is a rare anomaly that develops in the second and third trimesters.",
