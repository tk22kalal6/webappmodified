Transitional milk • Secreted after 3 to 4 days until 2 weeks • Immunoglobulin and protein content decreases, while the fat and sugar content increases. Mature milk • Follows transitional milk. • Thinner and more watery. • Contains all the nutrients essential for the optimal growth of the baby.

Breastmilk jaundice is seen in about 2–4% of exclusively breastfed babies. There is significant \nunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia after the 7th day and may last for 2–3 weeks. This may be \ncaused by the breast milk that might contain -glucuronidase, which deconjugates intestinal \nbilirubin and promotes its absorption and other inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase. Persistently \nhigh bilirubin levels may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24–48 h and/or \ntreatment with phototherapy, without cessation of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice (BFJ) It is an early-onset, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of breastfed infants. Occurs in the 1st week \nafter birth (usually appears after 24 - 72 hours of birth).

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Finger-feeding is optimally indicated for short-term use and may improve breastfeeding rates at \ndischarge. It is indicated in neurologically compromised and preterm infants for a short period of \ntime. Paladai feeding is indicated in preterm, late preterm, and term infants for supplementation. It is \neconomic, cheap, and is easy to use and clean. It has a risk of aspiration and is a slower method of \nfeeding. Feeding tubes- orogastric or nasogastric tubes are an efficient way of measuring intake. It is \noptimally used in very preterm infants with no suck-swallow-breathe coordination for long-term \nuse. It requires frequent replacement. Bottle and teat feeding, though not recommended is an efficient way to feed. Slow-flow teats \nmimic breastfeeding and are preferred to rapid-flow teats. They allow overfeeding and there is a \nrisk of aspiration. 116 \nSold by @itachibot Protein Energy Malnutrition",
