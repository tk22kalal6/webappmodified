      "question": "Question 1: A mother brought a healthy-looking, 3-month-old infant for routine immunization. As you \nwere giving the shot, you noticed some noisy breathing in the baby, which became worse once \nhe started crying. However, it decreased, as you held him in a prone position. There were no \nclear signs of distress. According to his mother, he had been feeding well at home and has not \nhad any episodes of apnea or cyanosis. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A clinical picture of inspiratory stridor that worsens on crying and relieves in a prone position in a \nnewborn without respiratory distress is suggestive of laryngomalacia. Laryngomalacia is the most common congenital laryngeal anomaly and the most common cause \nof stridor in infants and children. Stridor is exacerbated by any exertion: crying, agitation, or \nfeeding. In the prone position, the stridor disappears. On laryngoscopy, an omega-shaped epiglottis is visualized. In most children, only expectant observation is required as the condition resolves secondary to \nnervous system maturation, within 18 to 24 months of birth. However, neonates with severe \nlaryngomalacia may develop marked upper airway obstruction resulting in cor pulmonale, \nlife-threatening apneic episodes, feeding difficulties, obstructive sleep apnea, and failure to \nthrive. In such cases, surgical resection of supraglottic tissues and supraglottoplasty has been the \nfavoured approach.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Thumb sign on lateral x-ray of neck is pathognomonic for acute epiglottitis (AE). It is seen due to \nepiglottic enlargement. AE is an inflammation of the epiglottis. The arytenoids, false cords, and posterior tongue may also \nbe involved. In children, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is the most common cause. This has decreased \ndramatically since the widespread availability of immunization (pentavalent). Streptococcus \npyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus have also been implicated. Non-infectious causes can be \nforeign body ingestion and trauma from thermal or caustic agents. It has a progressive and potentially fulminating course, characterised by high fever, sore throat, \ndyspnea, and rapidly progressing respiratory obstruction. AE is a clinical diagnosis and a true emergency, X-ray soft tissue neck is not necessary to confirm \nit. It may be used to rule out differentials such as laryngotracheobronchitis, foreign body \nobstruction, retropharyngeal abscess or congenital anomalies. The time taken for X-rays should be \navoided in a critically ill child due to the risk of sudden complete airway obstruction. The definitive diagnosis of AE is made during direct laryngoscopy. However, since manipulation \ncan induce a laryngospasm, it is generally avoided. The image below shows thumb sign:",

But, since the widespread use of the H. influenzae type b vaccine, invasive \ndisease caused by H. influenzae type b in pediatric patients has been reduced by 99%.

The age of presentation of laryngotracheobronchitis ranges from 6 months-6 years. The clinical \nfeatures include barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, low-grade fever. Management: • Racemic epinephrine nebulization leads to the rapid improvement of upper airway obstruction. \nEpinephrine constricts pre-capillary arterioles in the upper airway mucosa and decreases capillary \nhydrostatic pressure, leading to fluid resorption and improvement in airway edema. • Dexamethasone-by the least invasive route (Oral&gt;IV&gt;IM ).

Acute bronchiolitis refers to airway inflammation and obstruction of the lower respiratory tract. Clinical features of bronchiolitis include fever, cough, fine inspiratory crackles, expiratory \nwheezes, and breathing difficulty. Cyanosis may be seen in severe cases.

It is reserved as a last-line agent for life-threatening bronchiolitis in \npatients who are immunocompromised or who have hemodynamically significant \ncardiopulmonary disease. In otherwise healthy children, the management of acute RSV \nbronchiolitis is typically supportive. Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolized resembles purine RNA nucleotides.

      "explanation": "The history of progressive torticollis, neck pain and dysphagia in a young child along with a neck \nX-ray demonstrating a prevertebral soft-tissue swelling are all indicative of a retropharyngeal \nabscess. In young children, an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection is the most common \ncause of an RP abscess and not trauma. It involves the suppuration of lymph nodes present in the RP space and is more common in \nchildren younger than 3-4 years since these lymph node chains involute after 5 years of age. Boys \nare affected more often than girls. In older children and adults, the cause is usually trauma to the \nposterior pharynx, which leads to inoculation of the retropharyngeal space. Risk factors include poor oral hygiene, diabetes, an immunocompromised state, and low \nsocioeconomic status. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and include fever, decreased oral intake, and drooling. \nNeck stiffness and torticollis may also be present. As the abscess grows in size, it can also lead to \nupper airway obstruction and asphyxiation.
