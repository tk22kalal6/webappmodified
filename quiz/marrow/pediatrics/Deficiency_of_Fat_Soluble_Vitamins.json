      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Vitamin A is required for the maintenance of epithelial functions, creating an effective barrier \nagainst pathogens; hence, it is called as an anti-infective vitamin. So, vitamin A deficiency can \nlead to changes in the epithelia of all mucosal surfaces, leading to increased chances of infections. Vitamin E (Tocopherol) helps is an anti-oxidant. Deficiency manifests as skin changes and hair \nloss. Vitamin D maintains calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Deficiency can lead to rickets in \nchildren and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin C helps in the formation of connective tissues and collagen in the skin, bone, and blood \nvessels. Deficiency leads to their fragility and causes scurvy. 139 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The girl is suffering from measles. It is associated with vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with an increased risk of infection and increased mortality with \na variety of infectious diseases particularly measles. Hence, vitamin A therapy is indicated in all \npatients with measles. The main functions of vitamin A are as follows: • Maintenance of vision, especially night vision • Maintenance of epithelial tissues • Differentiation of various tissues, particularly during reproduction and gestation, by regulating \ngene expression. Features of vitamin A deficiency: • Eyes: Defective dark adaptation is a characteristic early clinical feature, resulting in night \nblindness (earliest manifestation). This can further progress to xerophthalmia, Bitot's spots, \nconjunctivitis, or keratomalacia, leading to blindness. • Poor overall growth, anaemia • Diarrhoea, susceptibility to infections • Increased intracranial pressure • Keratinization of mucous membranes and skin (hyperkeratosis)",

Bitot spots are triangular, frequently bilateral, and present on the bulbar \nconjunctiva. Normally, bulbar conjunctiva is a stratified, columnar, non-keratinized epithelium. In vitamin A \ndeficiency, there is squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and tangles of keratin \nadmixed with gas-forming bacteria producing a dry, scaly patch with a foamy appearance called \nBitot spots. Option A: Deposition of calcium in the conjunctiva is termed conjunctival concretions, which \nusually occurs over the palpebral conjunctiva, in chronic inflammatory conditions of the eye. Option B: Scarring of the conjunctiva is seen in chlamydial infection of the eye. Option C: Excessive growth of conjunctival tissue is seen in the pterygium of the eye. 140 \nSold by @itachibot",

It promotes \nhair growth and prevents hair roots from getting damaged by free radical injury. Alpha-tocopherol is the active component of vitamin E and it is mainly located within cell \nmembranes, preventing lipid peroxidation and the formation of free radicals. Deficiency of this can also lead to neurological defects, hemolysis, and posterior column defect. Treatment includes vitamin E supplementation (25–50 units/day for a week). Note: The other vitamins having antioxidant properties are vitamins A, C, and E (vitamin E is the most \nimportant). The other vitamin beneficial in the treatment of hair fall is biotin.",

Hypophosphatemic rickets: X- linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common genetic cause of rickets while \nthe most common, overall is nutritional vitamin D \ndeficiency. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on x chromosome) products are \nresponsible for the inactivation of phosphatonin. Mutation of this PHEX leads to increased \nphosphatonin (FGF 23) levels, and hence, the excretion of phosphorous is increased. This is also \nassociated with impaired renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate leading to its excess excretion. The chart attached below summarizes the evaluation of hypophosphatemic rickets. Treatment-resistant rickets : Patients respond well to a combination of oral phosphorus and 1,25-D (calcitriol). Frequent dosing \nhelps prevent prolonged decrements in serum phosphorus levels because there is a rapid decline \nafter each dose. In addition, frequent dosing decreases diarrhea, which is a complication of \nhigh-dose oral phosphorus.",

        "a": "2, 3, 4",
        "b": "1 and 4 only",
        "c": "1, 3, 5",
        "d": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Phosphatonin is a group of phosphate-regulating factors produced by osteocytes, and FGF 23 is \nthe most important phosphatonin. Phosphatonin increases renal excretion (not reabsorption) of \nphosphate. Mechanism of phosphatonin action: Vitamin D receptor activation by 1,25 dihydroxy D (active vit D)  FGF 23 release by osteocytes 149 \nSold by @itachibot  Reduces expression of sodium-phosphate transporter in proximal convoluted tubules of the \nkidney  Increased urinary phosphate excretion Meanwhile, phosphatonin decreases the activity of 1 alpha hydroxylase and, therefore, the \nproduction of 1,25-D as well. So, the absorption of phosphate from the intestine is also reduced. 150 \nSold by @itachibot Deficiency of Water-soluble Vitamins & Trace Elements",
