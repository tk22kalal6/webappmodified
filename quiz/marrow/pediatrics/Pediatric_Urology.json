      "explanation": "530 \nSold by @itachibot The presence of a single umbilical artery can be expected to be seen in the case of a baby with \nunilateral renal agenesis. Renal agenesis occurs secondary to a defect of the Wolffian duct, ureteric bud, or metanephric \nblastema. It is often discovered during the course of an evaluation for other congenital anomalies \n(VACTERL syndrome). Its incidence is increased in newborns with a single umbilical artery. The \ncontralateral kidney undergoes compensatory hypertrophy. Some children also have contralateral \nvesicoureteral re■ux. Most males have an ipsilateral absent vas deferens. NOTE: VACTERL syndrome - Vertebral defects, imperforate Anus, Congenital heart disease, \nTracheo-Esophageal fistula, Renal and Limb defects",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a young girl with continuous dribbling of urine, despite normal \nvoiding, strongly suggests the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter. An ectopic ureter refers to a condition where the ureter drains outside the bladder. It is more \ncommon in females and opens either into the urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina. \nHence, they present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though the child voids regularly \n(paradoxical incontinence). The terminal part of the ureter is frequently narrowed, leading to hydroureteronephrosis. Urinary \ntract infections (UTIs) are common due to urinary stasis. In males, ectopic ureters usually enter the posterior urethra above the external sphincter, hence \nthey are usually continent and most patients present with UTI or epididymitis. Investigations include renal ultrasound (USG), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and renal scan \nto assess function. USG shows a hydronephrotic kidney or dilated upper pole and ureter. If there \nis a satisfactory function, the recommended treatment options are ureteral reimplantation into \nthe bladder or ureteroureterostomy. The poor function may require partial or total nephrectomy. Other options: Option B: A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, typically obstructive due to a \nsmall ureteral opening. In childhood, they commonly present with infections. Larger ureteroceles \ncan cause obstruction at the bladder neck. Option C: Congenital megaureter (dilated ureter) presents UTI, urinary stones, hematuria, and \nflank pain because of urinary stasis. Option D: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from the \nbladder to the ureter and kidney. They usually present with recurrent attacks of UTI.",
