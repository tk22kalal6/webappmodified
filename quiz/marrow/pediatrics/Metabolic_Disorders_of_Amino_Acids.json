      "explanation": "Mousy odor is characteristically seen in phenylketonuria due to excess phenylacetate (phenyl \nketone) formed in the body. In the absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine enters into alternate metabolic \npathways which result in the formation of phenyl lactate, phenylacetate, and \nphenylacetylglutamine.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical vignette describes a case of phenylketonuria. CNS damage in patients with \nphenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by hyperphenylalaninemia in brain tissue. High blood levels of phenylalanine saturate the transport system across the blood-brain barrier \ncausing inhibition of the cerebral uptake of other large neutral amino acids such as tyrosine and \ntryptophan impairing brain protein synthesis. Microcephaly, prominent maxillae with widely spaced teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and growth \nretardation are other common findings in untreated children. Low bone mineral density and \nosteopenia have been reported in affected individuals of all ages. Excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenyl ketones (phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate) that \nare excreted in the urine. However, these metabolites have no role in the pathogenesis of CNS \ndamage; their presence in body fluids simply signifies the severity of the condition. 247 \nSold by @itachibot Hypotyrosinemia can be partially responsible for the signs and symptoms but the primary cause is \nhyperphenylalaninemia. Laboratory diagnoses of phenylketonuria include: • Guthrie's test: growth of bacillus subtilis is seen • Ferric chloride urine test: transient blue-green color • Blood phenylalanine levels: elevated • Enzyme studies • Genetic mutation studies • Tandem mass spectrometry: Gold standard screening method for all metabolic disorders.",

      "explanation": "Defects of either phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) or tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4) can cause \nhyperphenylalaninemias. PAH deficiency is diagnosed as phenylketonuria. Malignant hyperphenylalaninemias include three enzyme defects, dihydropteridine \nreductase,pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and GTP cyclohydrolase which help in BH4 \nsynthesis. The deficiency of BH4 impairs three hydroxylase(phenylalanine, tyrosine, and \ntryptophan), and severe neurological symptoms develop because of the lack of neurotransmitters.

Dietary deficiency of this amino acid is manifested \nby lethargy, failure to thrive, anorexia, anemia, rashes, diarrhea, and even death; moreover, \ntyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in this disorder and its adequate intake must be \nensured.

      "explanation": "The diagnosis is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) which is due to deficiency of branched-chain \n-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH). Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are the 3 essential amino acids, which are branched-chain amino \nacids. Their decarboxylation is accomplished by BCKDH using thiamine (vitamin B1) \npyrophosphate as a coenzyme. Leucine is metabolized by BCAA aminotransferase to -ketoisocaproic acid, which leads to the \ndisrupted metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids (glutamate, GABA, glutamine, 256 \nSold by @itachibot alanine, and aspartate). -Ketoisocaproic acid can reversibly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation \nand result in cerebral lactic acidosis. Collectively, these processes are detrimental to the normal \nfunction of neurons and glia, clinically manifesting as encephalopathy and brain edema and \nreferred to as leucinosis. Treatment options include hemodialysis, restricting dietary substances, thiamine for milder \nforms, and orthotopic liver transplant.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Biotin is the treatment of choice for multiple carboxylase deficiency. Multiple carboxylase deficiency refers to one of two inherited defects of biotin metabolism. \nTomcat urine is characteristically seen in multiple carboxylase deficiency. • Neonatal/infantile form is caused by a deficiency of holocarboxylase synthetase and presents in \nthe first week of life with lethargy, poor muscle tone, and vomiting. • Juvenile/late form is caused by biotinidase deficiency and is associated with a slow but \nprogressive loss of biotin in the urine, leading to organic aciduria. It is characterized by alopecia, \nataxia, ketoacidosis, dermatitis, seizures, myoclonus, and nystagmus. Both infantile and late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency can be treated with pharmacological \ndoses of biotin. It is called multiple carboxylase deficiency because biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is a \ncofactor for all 4 carboxylase enzymes in humans: • Pyruvate carboxylase • Acetyl CoA carboxylase • Propionyl CoA carboxylase • 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase Note: Acquired deficiency of biotin may occur in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition without \nadded biotin, in patients with prolonged use of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nprimidone, carbamazepine), and in children with short bowel syndrome or chronic diarrhea who \nare receiving formulas low in biotin. Excessive ingestion of raw eggs may also cause biotin \ndeficiency because the protein avidin in egg white binds biotin, decreasing its absorption. Infants \nwith a biotin deficiency may develop dermatitis, alopecia, and candidal skin infections. This 257 \nSold by @itachibot condition readily responds to treatment with oral biotin.",
