      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The WHO states that the perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks and ends at seven \ncompleted days after birth - 154 days. It corresponds to when the fetus weighs 500g or more. This definition is not to be confused with the period used for the calculation of the perinatal \nmortality rate (PMR). To calculate the PMR, a fetal weight above 1000 g is considered, which is \nachieved at 28 weeks of gestation. Therefore, for all statistical purposes, international \ncomparisons, and calculation of perinatal mortality rate, the period from the 28th week of life is \nconsidered. 10 \nSold by @itachibot Perinatal period: from the 22nd week. Perinatal mortality rate calculation: from the 28th week. The neonatal period is defined as the first 28 days after birth. Infancy is defined as the first \nyear of life. The image below shows various time periods. Only the time period for perinatal mortality and the \nperinatal period are different as shown in the image. For others, corresponding mortality rates are \ncalculated using the same time periods shown.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Neonates do not generate heat by shivering. Heat production in neonates happens by increasing the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption \nby releasing norepinephrine, which results in non-shivering thermogenesis through \nbeta-oxidation of brown fat. This sympathetic surge also causes cutaneous vasoconstriction. 12 \nSold by @itachibot Increased physical activity - crying, increased body movements, and muscular activity also \ncontribute to thermogenesis.

      "explanation": "Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) can be carried out by the mother or any other caregiver. KMC was introduced for the prevention of neonatal hypothermia in low birth weight/ premature \nnewborns. It has 4 components— • Skin-to-skin positioning of the newborn on the mother’s chest. • Adequate nutrition through breastfeeding. • Early discharge and ambulatory care. • Support for mother and family for child care. Evidence shows that- • It is as good as incubators, in terms of safety and thermal protection (measured by mortality) • Reduces severe morbidity by way of facilitating breastfeeding • Humanization of neonatal care • Promoted bonding between mother and child Eligibility criteria for KMC: It is indicated for all hemodynamically stable low birth weight babies. Short sessions of KMC can \nbe initiated in babies on medical treatment like IV fluids or oxygen therapy. Initiation of KMC can \nvary with the birth weight of the baby. • Birth weight &lt;1200 g - It may take days to weeks for initiation of KMC • Birth weight =1200-1800 g - Only a few days may be taken before KMC initiation 13 \nSold by @itachibot • Birth weight &gt;1800 g - KMC can be initiated immediately after birth All mothers without any serious illness can provide KMC. Positioning for KMC: The baby is placed between the mother's breast in an upright position. The \nhips are abducted and flexed in the frog position and the arms are also flexed. The abdomen of the \nbaby should be at the level of the mother's epigastrium. In this position, the mother's breathing \nwould stimulate the baby and prevent the development of apnea. The duration of KMC should be gradually increased from short sessions of more than one hour to \n24 hours a day. KMC is not necessary once the baby attains 2500 g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation. Note: Incubatory care, feeding via nasal catheter, and prevention of infection are part of intensive care \nfor low birthweight babies.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The greenish-black color of the first stool in the newborn is due to biliverdin. Meconium is a dark, sticky material that is normally present in the intestine at birth and passed in \nthe feces after birth. It is detected in the ileum at about 70–85 days of fetal life and begins to fill \nthe colon and lower ileum late in the 4th month of gestation. The greenish color of the meconium \nis the consequence of the bile pigments excreted by the biliary tract. The main component 16 \nSold by @itachibot responsible for the greenish color of the meconium is biliverdin (a pigment formed from the \noxidation of bilirubin). Up to the 22nd week of gestation, the intestinal content is not greenish and for this reason, fetal \ndefecation would not stain the amniotic fluid. The production of biliverdin starts over the next few \nweeks or at a time closer to labor, probably due to a biochemical switch related to the bilirubin \noxidation system. Bilirubin is responsible for the yellow color of the stools. Neonates do not harbor gut flora at birth.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A brisk Moro reflex can be seen in neonates with hypoglycemia. In hypoglycemic babies, there is an activation of the autonomic system, which results in \njitteriness. Newborns often exhibit this as an exaggerated Moro reflex. The Moro reflex is a primitive reflex that is very sensitive to the infant's level of alertness. It is \nelicited by supporting the infant in the semierect position and allowing the infant’s head to fall \nbackward onto the examiner’s hand. An animated gif of normal response to Moro's reflex where there is symmetrical extension and \nabduction of the upper extremities, followed by flexion of the upper extremities is shown below 17 \nSold by @itachibot The Moro reflex disappears by 6 months of age in normal infants. Absent Moro reflex: caused by significant generalized disturbance of the CNS • Stage III HIE • Kernicterus Asymmetric Moro reflex: feature of the root, plexus, or nerve disease • Fractured clavicle • Brachial plexus injury (Erb's palsy) • Hemiparesis Brisk Moro reflex: • Neonatal hypoglycemia • Can also be a normal variant in healthy infants • Stage I HIE Exaggerated, stereotyped, non-habituating Moro reflex is a feature of severe bilateral intrauterine \ncerebral disturbance, perhaps because of the release of the brain stem from inhibitory cortical \ninfluences. It is seen in conditions such as the following: • Hydranencephaly • Severe micrencephaly Moro reflex in different stages of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE): • Stage I HIE (mild): Brisk • Stage II HIE (moderate): Weak/incomplete • Stage III HIE (severe): Absent Option A: In kernicterus, there is a deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia and \nbrain stem. Hence, the Moro reflex is absent Option C: In stage III HIE, the muscles are flaccid and the infant is comatose. Thus, the Moro \nreflex is absent. Option D: Erb's palsy results from an injury to the brachial plexus. So, the reflex is absent on the \nside of injury as the nerve supplying the muscles involved (efferent of the reflex) is affected.",
