His previous medical \nrecords give the diagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy. Which micronutrient deficiency is \nmost likely seen in this case?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Keshan disease is due to the deficiency of selenium. It is a congestive cardiomyopathy that is \ncaused due to dietary deficiency of selenium. Keshan is a county of China where the symptoms were noted first. The disease is also endemic to \nthat province. The patients will mostly present with acute breathlessness, paroxysms of \nexacerbated attacks. Selenium is an enzyme cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, which prevents oxidative damage. Note: Kashin Beck disease is a chronic, endemic osteochondropathy due to selenium deficiency.",

      "explanation": "Scurvy is a deficiency of vitamin C. The correct answer is 1, 3, 5. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, which cannot be synthesized in the human body due to \ndeficient L-gulonolactone oxidase enzyme. Breast milk contains adequate amounts of ascorbic \nacid, whereas the pasteurisation of animal milk at high temperature destroys vitamin C. Functions of Vitamin C / Ascorbic Acid : • Synthesis of collagen (Hydroxylation of proline, which is vital for collagen; in the formation of \nthe bone matrix). • Neurotransmitter metabolism (conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine and tryptophan to \nserotonin) • Cholesterol metabolism (conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones and bile acids) • Biosynthesis of carnitine 158 \nSold by @itachibot • Antioxidation (electron donor) • For the cellular and immunologic functions of the hematopoietic system The image below shows peri-follicular haemorrhages.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette is suggestive of chronic zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency affects both \ncell-mediated and humoral immunity. The cell-mediated immunity is impaired predominantly, as \nzinc is essential for T-cell division, maturation, and differentiation. In a child with a phytate-rich diet, a chronic deficiency of zinc and iron usually co-exist. Isolated \nchronic zinc deficiency can be seen in the setting of a child suffering from chronic diarrhoea, \nrepeated pneumonia or chest infections, and congenital malabsorption disorders. Chronic zinc deficiency manifests as: • Dwarfism • Hypogonadism • Dermatitis of extremities and around orifices • T-cell immunodeficiency • Diarrhoea The features of acute zinc deficiency include: • Decreased growth • Poor wound healing • Diarrhea 159 \nSold by @itachibot",

Selenium toxicity is characterised by nausea, diarrhoea, neurologic manifestations, nail and hair \nchanges, and garlicky odour. It is commonly seen in areas where drinking water and the collated \nsoil is extremely rich in selenium. In India, selenium toxicity is endemic to agricultural sites \nlocated in the states of Punjab and Haryana. The presentations are usually acute in nature rather \nthan chronic. Chromium toxicity (Option - B) is commonly seen only in adults with occupational exposure. \nChromium is a pulmonary irritant and the symptoms are predominantly respiratory complaints \nsimilar to bronchitis. They also cause chronic allergic dermatitis and is carcinogenic too. Molybdenum toxicity (Option C) is very rarely seen in humans. It manifests usually as acute \ndiarrhoea.
