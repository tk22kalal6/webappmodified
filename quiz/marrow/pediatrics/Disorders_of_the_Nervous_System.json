Her \npregnancy was unplanned and she did not take folic acid supplementation prior to \nconception. Moreover, owing to the pandemic led lockdown and her remote residence, she \ncould not adhere to regular antenatal care. The newborn was born with a neural tube defect \nand immediately shifted to the NICU. What is the least likely diagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "550 \nSold by @itachibot Holoprosencephaly is not a neural tube defect (NTD) and hence, it is the least likely \ndiagnosis. Folic acid deficiency, especially in a young primigravida, is a risk factor for the \ndevelopment of NTDs in children, as seen in the given clinical vignette. NTDs result from the failure of the neural tube to close spontaneously between the 3rd and 4th \nweek of in utero development. These can be detected in antenatal ultrasound scans and \nsubsequently managed for a better prognosis. The major NTDs include the following: • Spina bifida occulta • Meningocele • Myelomeningocele • Encephalocele • Anencephaly • Syringomyelia • Diastematomyelia (split spinal cord) • Iniencephaly In holoprosencephaly, the forebrain fails to develop into two hemispheres due to mutations in the \nsonic hedgehog gene at the long arm of chromosome 7. It is a developmental disorder of the brain \nthat results from the defective formation of the prosencephalon and the inadequate induction of \nthe forebrain structures. The three types include, alobar, semilobar, and lobar, apart from the \nmiddle interhemispheric fusion variant or syntelencephaly. The image given below shows alobar holoprosencephaly-",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region in a newborn is suggestive of occult spinal dysraphism \nor neural tube defect. It comprises a range of conditions, including spina bifida occulta, intradural 551 \nSold by @itachibot lipoma, and dorsal dermal sinus. Spinal dysraphism is due to the defective fusion of the midline embryonic neural, vertebral, and \nmesenchymal structures. Associated clinical features are high-arched feet, muscle size and \nstrength differences between legs, and abnormal walking patterns. In newborns and young \ninfants, the neurological examination is usually normal, but older children may experience a lack \nof sensation in the perineal area and back pain. Most of the patients will have a cutaneous abnormality overlying the lower spine, including a \nsmall dimple, a tuft of hair, or a subcutaneous lipoma. The image shows a tuft of hair in a case of spinal dysraphism: Spinal dysraphism also includes meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, \ndiastematomyelia (split spinal cord), thickened filum terminale, and cauda equina tumour. The initial investigation is usually ultrasound in the neonate and the best investigation is MRI. Spina bifida is the most common type of spinal dysraphism, in which the spinal column does not \nclose completely, leaving the spinal cord and its protective covering exposed. 552 \nSold by @itachibot Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida, where the spinal cord and nerve roots \nare exposed and may be damaged. A sac-like protrusion, containing spinal cord tissue, meninges, \nand cerebrospinal fluid, is visible outside the body, often leading to significant neurological \nimpairments and disabilities.",

        "d": "Acetylcholinesterase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the presence of abnormal sonographic markers, like the lemon and \nbanana sign, is highly suggestive of neural tube defects (NTDs). Acetylcholinesterase is used as a \nbiochemical marker of neural tube defects during the screening tests. NTDs account for the largest proportion of congenital anomalies of the CNS. The failure of closure \nof neural tube allows excretion of fetal substances such as -fetoprotein (AFP) and \nacetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid thereby serving as biochemical markers for NTDs. The lemon and banana sign, noted on antenatal imaging, are one of the many notable fruits' \ninspired signs. The banana sign refers to the shape of the cerebellum owing to caudal \ndisplacement while the lemon sign refers to the lemon-shaped head resulting from scalloping of \nthe frontal bones. It is seen in fetuses with open neural tube defects. The image below shows the characteristic lemon sign on ultrasound- 553 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows the characteristic banana sign on ultrasound- Note: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA), inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotrophin \n(hCG) are the biochemical markers of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome).",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus in \nnewborns. Ventriculomegaly is the dilation of the ventricles. When ventriculomegaly occurs in association \nwith raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, it is called hydrocephalus. Pathologic etiologies can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include structural \nabnormalities such as aqueductal stenosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker \nmalformations, Chiari malformations, and neural tube defects. Acquired causes are intracranial \ninfections(cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic injury, and brain \nparenchymal tumors. Aqueductal stenosis is the narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow channel \nthat connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. As a result, the fluid accumulates within \nthe ventricles, causing them to enlarge. Treatment for aqueductal stenosis includes ventriculostomy, diuretics, serial lumbar punctures in \nspecific cases, and CSF diversion. In severe cases, CSF diversion procedures (shunting), may be \nnecessary to redirect the flow of CSF and relieve pressure on the brain. 555 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The clinical features of frequent vomiting, large head, bulging fontanelles, and a positive sunset \nsign (as seen in the image) point to a likely diagnosis of hydrocephalus. A vein of Galen \nmalformation can expand to become large and, because of its midline position, obstruct the flow \nof CSF, thereby causing an obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus. Vomiting is more in \nthe morning and becomes better when sitting due to poor absorption of CSF in a lying down \nposition. Hydrocephalus is not a specific disease; it represents a diverse group of conditions that result \nfrom impaired circulation or absorption of CSF.

It starts in early adolescence with one or more of the following features: bilateral \nmyoclonic jerks in the morning, causing patients to drop things, generalized tonic-clonic or \nclonic-tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening, and juvenile absence seizure. Consciousness is usually preserved. Precipitating factors include sleep deprivation, alcohol, and \nphotic stimulation. EEG shows 4 to 5Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. A family history of \nepilepsy is often present. The treatment options for JME include sodium valproate, levetiracetam, and \ntopiramate. Benzodiazepine, lamotrigine, perampanel, phenobarbital, primidone, and zonisamide \ncan be considered as add-on drugs. Complete remission is uncommon and has a high risk of \nseizure recurrence, hence antiepileptics are continued lifelong in a majority of the patients. Other options: Option B: Atypical absence seizures have been associated with myoclonic components and head \ndrop. They are precipitated by drowsiness and EEG shows 1 to 2 Hz spike and slow wave \ndischarges.

        "a": "Two doses of polysaccharide vaccine",
        "b": "Antibiotic prophylaxis",
        "c": "Two doses of conjugate vaccine",
        "d": "Single dose of meningococcal vaccine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Antibiotic prophylaxis is provided to the close contacts of persons with confirmed meningococcal \ndisease. Close contacts of individuals with confirmed meningococcal disease are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping the illness. Prophylaxis is also offered to individuals with direct and prolonged contact \nwith a case of meningococcal disease. Antibiotics are effective in preventing additional cases by \neradicating the carriage of the invasive strain. Treatment is provided to the contacts within 24 hours of identification of the index case. The \nantibiotics effective include rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Prophylaxis is not generally recommended for medical personnel, except in cases where there is \nexposure to aerosols of respiratory secretions, such as during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, \nintubation, or suctioning. This recommendation applies within 24 hours before or after the \ninitiation of antibiotic therapy in the index case. For the treatment of cases, penicillin is the preferred drug, but ceftriaxone or other \nthird-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with penicillin allergy. Droplet \ninfection control precautions should be followed for hospitalized patients for 24 hours after \neffective therapy has been initiated. Offering quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, W, Y conjugate vaccines in addition to antimicrobial \nprophylaxis can further reduce the risk of disease among close contacts of cases caused by vaccine \ncapsular groups. Meningococcal vaccines are available in two forms: polysaccharide vaccines and \npolysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines can be given as a single dose \nto individuals aged 2 years and older. They are offered in bivalent (A, C), trivalent (A, C, W135), \nand quadrivalent (A, C, W135, Y) formulations. 576 \nSold by @itachibot Meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available as monovalent (A or C) or quadrivalent (A, C, \nW135, Y) formulations. Conjugate vaccines, which offer increased immunogenicity and potential \nfor herd protection, are preferred over polysaccharide vaccines, especially in children under 2 \nyears of age. Both types of vaccines are safe to use during pregnancy.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Till 24 hours after starting antibiotics",
        "b": "Till cultures become negative",
        "c": "Till antibiotic course is complete",
        "d": "Till 12 hours after admission"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Isolation of the child is recommended until 24 hrs after the initiation of effective therapy after \nbeing diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis to prevent further transmission. Droplet precautions are recommended for patients with Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b (Hib) meningitis until they have received 24 hours of effective therapy. Patients \nshould be in private rooms, and hospital personnel should wear a face mask when they are within \n3 feet (1 meter) of the patient. The child with meningitis shows nonspecific symptoms like fever, anorexia, poor feeding, \nheadache, myalgia, hypotension, petechia, purpura, or a rash. Meningial irritation is indicated \nby nuchal rigidity, back pain, and Kernig, and Brudzinski signs (usually not seen in infants). \nSeizures and altered mental status may be present. The recommended empirical antibiotic regimen in a suspected case of meningitis outside the \nneonatal period is vancomycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin. Patients allergic \nto penicillin or cephalosporin can be treated with meropenem, fluoroquinolones, or \nchloramphenicol. Chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin/ceftriaxone/ciprofloxacin is recommended for all close contacts \nwith meningococcal meningitis regardless of age or immunization status. Rifampicin prophylaxis \nshould be given to all household contacts of patients with invasive disease caused by Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b, if an immunocompromised child of any age resides in the household or close \nfamily member younger than 48 months has not been fully immunized.",

      "question": "Question 31: A 2-year-old child with a history of fall 1 year back with parietal bone fracture, has now \npresented with a painful and growing parietal swelling. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Growing scalp hematoma",
        "b": "Growing fracture",
        "c": "Subdural hygroma",
        "d": "Chronic abscess"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a child with a painful and growing parietal swelling, coupled with a \nhistory of a prior parietal bone fracture one year ago, strongly suggests the diagnosis of a growing \nfracture, also known as traumatic encephalocele or leptomeningeal cysts. Skull fractures associated with a dural tear may fail to heal properly. The herniated brain, dilated \nventricles, or a leptomeningeal cyst may cause an enlargement of this tear. These fractures are \ncalled growing skull fractures. They are usually seen in children &lt; 3 years of age. They present as a localized swelling or palpable skull defect that increases in size, most commonly \nseen in the parietal region. However, they may go undetected for years and present with delayed \nonset of neurologic symptoms (headache, seizure, or neurologic deficit). Other options: Option A: The extended duration of one year makes scalp hematoma unlikely, as it usually \nresolves within a few months. 577 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Subdural hygromas are characterized by fluid accumulation in the subdural space. Most \npatients with subdural hygromas are asymptomatic, but uncommon symptoms may include \nheadaches, changes in mental status, nausea and vomiting, focal neurological deficits, and \nseizures. They don't present with scalp swelling. Option D: Chronic abscess may show inflammatory changes like erythema, pus, sinus, and \nsystemic features like fever.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Decerebrate or decorticate posturing is not seen in brain death as they are motor responses to \nnoxious stimuli that originate from the midbrain and cortex. Brain death, also known as death by neurologic criteria refers to the irreversible and total \ncessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The three components for diagnosing brain death are a demonstration of coexisting irreversible \ncoma with a known cause, absence of brain stem reflexes, and apnea. Coma requires the patient to \nbe unresponsive, even to noxious stimuli. The diagnosis of brain death can still be made despite \npositive spinal reflexes. (option B) Brainstem reflexes (pupillary responses, oculocephalic reflex, oculovestibular responses, corneal \nreflex, jaw reflex, facial grimacing, pharyngeal gag reflex, coughing) are absent. Apnea is the \nabsence of respiratory drive at PaCO2 of 60mmHg and &gt; 20mmHg above baseline, which is \nconsistent with brain death. The following manifestations are occasionally seen and should not be misinterpreted as evidence \nof brainstem function: • Normal systolic blood pressure - SBP &gt;100 mmHg (option A) • Movements originating from the spinal cord or peripheral nerve may occur • Sweating, flushing, tachycardia (option C) • Deep tendon reflexes; superficial abdominal reflexes; triple flexion response • Babinski reflex • Spontaneous movements of limbs other than pathologic flexion or extension response • Respiratory-like movements (shoulder elevation and adduction, back-arching, intercostal \nexpansion without significant tidal volumes) 578 \nSold by @itachibot Disorders of Thyroid",
