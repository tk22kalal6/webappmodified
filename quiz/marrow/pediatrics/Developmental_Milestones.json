      "explanation": "Understanding that objects continue to exist even when not seen is called object permanence. This \nis due to an ability to form a mental representation of the object. It is attained at the age of 8–9 \nmonths. Option A: Separation anxiety begins at about 9 months of age. Children wake up crying from their \nnaps as they realize that their parents are not in the same room as them. This is different from \nstranger anxiety displayed by the child at the age of 6-7 months, wherein they react to \napproaching strangers by crying or clinging to their parent. Option B: A transitional object is an object, such as a blanket or a stuffed toy, that is used by many \nchildren as a symbol of the absent parent. It is seen at around 18 months. Option C: Symbolic transformations in play: • At 12 months - make-believe (symbolic) play centres on the child’s own body, e.g., the child \npretends to drink from an empty cup. • At 18 month - symbolic transformations in play are not limited to the child's body, e.g., a doll \ncan be fed from a plate.",
