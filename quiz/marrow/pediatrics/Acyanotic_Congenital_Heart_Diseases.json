      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Wide, variable splitting of S2 is a feature of VSD and not reverse splitting. The basic defect in VSD is a left-to-right shunt which occurs at the ventricular level. During \nsystole, the left ventricle empties into the aorta and the right ventricle via the VSD, because of \nwhich the total amount of blood in the right side of the heart increases, and that on the left \ndecreases. Due to this increase, the right ventricle takes a longer time to empty causing a delayed \nP2 and on the other hand, the left ventricle empties sooner causing an early A2. This explains the \nwide S2. Variations due to respiration still happen and hence, the second heart sound is widely \nand variably split. Auscultatory findings of VSD include a pansystolic murmur also known as Roger's murmur/shunt \nmurmur can be best heard in the fourth left intercostal space. Flow murmurs that can be heard \ninclude, an MDM at the mitral area and an ejection systolic murmur at the pulmonary area.

In ventricular septal defect (VSD), there is left to right shunting of blood, and this large volume of \nshunted blood passes through the lungs, which is recognized in the chest X-ray as pulmonary \nplethora (increased pulmonary vasculature).

Surgical repair is not recommended. Guidelines from the Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young of the American Heart \nAssociation (AHA) state that an isolated, small, hemodynamically insignificant VSD is not an \nindication for surgery. VSDs may get smaller or close completely without treatment, but they \nwon't get any bigger.

The presence of a mid-diastolic, low-pitched rumble at the apex is caused by increased blood flow \nacross the mitral valve and usually indicates a Qp: Qs ratio of 2: 1. This murmur is best \nappreciated with the bell of the stethoscope.

A soft \nejection systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border is also commonly found. The soft ejection systolic murmur is a flow murmur heard due to increased blood flow through the \nnormal pulmonary valve. A delayed diastolic murmur can also be heard in the tricuspid area. As \nthe right ventricle now receives more blood, the time required for its emptying is increased \nresulting in prolonged P2. Since the two atria are linked, inspiration does not produce any net \npressure changes between them abolishing respiration-related changes in venous return hence \ncausing fixed S2. Causes of Wide and fixed splitting of S2 include, • Atrial septal defect • RBBB • TAPVC Other options: TAPVC - patients usually present with cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure around 4-10 weeks \nof age - this is when the fetal pulmonary vasculature regresses and there is increased pulmonary \nblood flow which results in early-onset cardiac failure.

It is a result of reduced arterial oxygen saturation in the distal aorta \ncompared to that in the aorta proximal to the left subclavian artery.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The right upper limb is the best area to check pre-ductal oxygen saturation in a newborn infant as \nit receives blood supply primarily from the right brachial artery, which arises from the aorta \nbefore the ductus arteriosus. In routine neonatal screening for critical congenital heart diseases (CCHD), saturation probes are \nplaced on the right upper limb (pre-ductal) and the right lower limb (post-ductal) respectively. If the difference between pre-ductal and post-ductal saturation is more than five percent, it \nconfirms the presence of hypoxemia. Any reading showing an SpO2 &lt;90% or greater than a \nthree percent difference between the right hand and right foot for three successive readings \nseparated by an hour each would suggest the presence of a congenital cardiac disease. Screening is done to identify critical conditions before they present symptomatically, and before \nthe neonate leaves the hospital post-delivery. This would allow for early and effective treatment of \nan underlying disease. Critical congenital heart diseases include coarctation of the aorta, double outlet right ventricle, \nEbstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia, \nsingle ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVC), \nd-transposition of the great arteries (TGA), tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.",

Pansystolic or holosystolic murmurs begin almost simultaneously with the 1st heart sound and \ncontinue throughout systole (do not spill into diastole like a continuous murmur).

The \nfemoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in up to 40% of \npatients), in contrast to the bounding pulses of the arms and carotid vessels.
