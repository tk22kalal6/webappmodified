MAS is a rare but potentially fatal complication of systemic JIA. It is characterized by an \nuncontrolled activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages.

It is \ncharacterized by the following: • Macrophage hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow • Hypofibrinogenemia (paradoxical fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) • Hypertriglyceridemia 714 \nSold by @itachibot • Extreme hyperferritinemia • Fever &gt;38.5°C • Splenomegaly • Cytopenia affecting at least two of three cell lineages Treatment usually includes high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents in refractory \ncases.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The baby has raccoon eyes (periorbital rash) with complete heart block (P-R dissociation) \nsuggestive of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). Anti-Ro antibodies are used to \ndiagnose neonatal lupus. Neonatal Lupus Erythematosus(NLE): NLE is not an autoimmune condition. It occurs when maternal autoantibodies enter the fetal \ncirculation (passive transfer). The antibodies responsible for this condition are anti-Ro \nantibody (anti-SSA) and anti-La antibody (anti-SSB). The periorbital rash typically appears within 6 weeks of life and lasts 3-4 months. However, it can \nbe present at birth. Infants may also have cytopenias and hepatitis, but the most feared \ncomplication is congenital heart block. Cardiomyopathy is seen in the most severe cases. The \nnoncardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus are usually reversible, whereas congenital heart block \nis permanent. Conduction system abnormalities can be detected in utero by fetal echocardiogram \nbeginning at 16 weeks of gestational age. Fluorinated corticosteroids seem to improve cases of hydrops. Significant conduction system \nabnormalities after birth are treated with cardiac pacing and occasionally intravenous \nimmunoglobulin and steroids, while severe cardiomyopathy may require cardiac transplantation. \nTransient, noncardiac manifestations are conservatively managed, with topical steroids used \noccasionally to treat the rash. Other options: Anti-Jo antibodies are a type of myositis-specific antibodies. These are not related to neonatal \nlupus. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE (Systemic Lupus erythematosus). Anti-histone antibodies are present in Drug-induced SLE. Note: SS in SSA and SSB stands for Sjögren's syndrome-related. Anti-SSA and anti SSB are antinuclear \nantibodies and are mainly found in patients with SLE and Sjögren's syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario showing swelling of knee joints (arthritis), non-blanching rash in the \nlower limbs (palpable purpura), along with hematuria and proteinuria (renal involvement) in a \nchild is suggestive of Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP). HSP (IgA vasculitis) is a small vessel vasculitis most commonly seen in the age group of 3-8 years. \nIt generally follows an upper respiratory tract infection and there is a history of atopy in one-third \nof the cases. The pathology of HSP involves leukocytoclastic vasculitis and the deposition of IgA in the affected \nblood vessels. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to that of \nIgA nephropathy. Clinical manifestations include palpable purpura, the hallmark feature of HSP, which \ncharacteristically involves the extensor surfaces of arms and legs. Musculoskeletal symptoms such \nas arthritis and arthralgia are common. Gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain, \nvomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. Renal involvement may lead to gross or microscopic hematuria, \nnephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal manifestations are more severe in adults. A \nrapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases. Nephritis usually follows the \nappearance of the rash. Diagnosis of HSP is primarily based on clinical findings, including the palpable purpura, along \nwith the presence of other symptoms. Laboratory tests are not specific to HSP but may show \nnonspecific markers of inflammation and sometimes elevated levels of IgA. Imaging studies and \nbiopsies of affected tissues can provide additional diagnostic information Treatment of HSP is generally supportive, focusing on hydration, pain relief, and nutrition. \nCorticosteroids may be used in severe cases or for significant gastrointestinal involvement. \nIntravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are occasionally employed for severe \ndisease. Nephritis due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressants \nlike prednisolone and azathioprine. Complications of HSP can include serious gastrointestinal \nproblems, kidney disease, and recurrences, but overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP is \nfavorable. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and urine is recommended to detect and manage \npotential complications.",
