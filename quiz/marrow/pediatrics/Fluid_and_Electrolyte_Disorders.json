      "question": "Question 1: A 6-month-old infant was brought to the OPD by his mother with a history of passing watery \nstools more than 4 times in the past day. On examination, the baby is alert and on pinching \nhis skin, it goes back quickly. The infant weighs 5.7 Kg. What is the initial fluid of choice for \ntreating diarrhoea in this infant?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Tender coconut water",
        "b": "Oral rehydration solution (ORS)",
        "c": "Salted yoghurt",
        "d": "ReSoMal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In an infant with diarrhoea, the initial fluid of choice is oral rehydration solution (ORS). The glucose-dependent sodium and water absorption is the principle behind replacing glucose and \nsodium in a 1:1 molar ratio in the WHO oral rehydration solution (ORS). The low osmolarity of the \nORS in the lumen as compared to the blood facilitate absorption of fluid and hence the \nelectrolytes due to the solvent drag. Studies have shown that low osmolarity ORS causes reduction of stool output, decrease in \nvomiting and decrease in the use of unscheduled intravenous fluids without increasing the risk of \nhyponatremia. Other home available fluids that can be used are salted rice water/salted yoghurt \ndrinks, vegetable/chicken soup with salt. ReSoMal is given to severely malnourished children. In this case, since the infant’s weight is \nappropriate for its age ORS is given.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows intraosseous cannulation for fluid transfusion in the anterior proximal \ntibia. The intraosseous route is an alternative to the intravenous (IV) route in the transfusion of fluids in \nshock. • The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into a central venous canal, \nemissary veins, and ultimately the central circulation. • So, the bone marrow functions as a non-collapsible venous access route. Intraosseous cannulation is recommended for patients in whom IV access proves difficult or \nunattainable. (e.g., in cardiopulmonary arrest). In such a case, if venous access is not available 173 \nSold by @itachibot within 1 min, an intraosseous needle should be placed in the anterior proximal tibia. Insertion sites for intraosseous infusion: • In the proximal tibia, 1-2 cm anteromedial from the tibial tuberosity • Distal tibia at the junction of the medial malleolus and the shaft of the tibia • Distal one-third of the femur",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with serum osmolality and urinary osmolality, after a cranial \nsurgery, suggests a diagnosis of post-surgical central diabetes insipidus (DI). Irreversible central \nDI follows most cases of complete resections of craniopharyngioma. Serum osmolality of &gt;295 mOsm/L (normal: 280-295 mOsm/L) and the urine osmolality \nof &lt;300 mOsm/L (normal: 500-850mOsm/L) are suggestive of DI. A water deprivation test is \ndone to further classify the types of DI. Option A: In postoperative patients, because of IV fluids there is an acute expansion of ECF \nvolume. This suppresses high ADH activity and causes diuresis with normal serum osmolality. Option B: In SIADH, serum osmolality is decreased. Option D: In cerebral salt-wasting syndrome there is hypersecretion ANP and their levels \nare usually elevated.",

Severely malnourished children have excess intracellular sodium (leaky cell membranes and \nreduced activity of the sodium–potassium pump). So, sodium intake should be reduced and a \nlow-sodium oral rehydration solution (ReSoMal) is advised.

But, the weight of the child here is 7 \nKg, which suggests that the child is malnourished. The child may be having edematous \nmalnutrition (kwashiorkor), where skin may go back to the original position even in the presence \nof dehydration. Hence, the skin pinch is not reliable for the assessment of dehydration in this \nchild.

Hypernatremia causes movement of water from brain cells into hypertonic extracellular fluid, \ncausing brain cell shrinkage and shearing of blood vessels within brain. This leads to central \nnervous system hemorrhages and thrombosis. The fluid deficit is corrected slowly as rapid treatment of hypernatremic dehydration causes \nmovement of water from the extracellular space into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema, \nseizures, brain herniation, and even death.",
