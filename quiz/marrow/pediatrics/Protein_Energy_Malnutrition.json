      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A low weight-for-height, or wasting, indicates acute malnutrition. Nutritional status is often assessed in terms of anthropometry • Low weight-for-height, or wasting, indicates acute malnutrition. • High weight-for-height indicates overweight. • Low height-for-age, or stunting, indicates chronic malnutrition. This is the best indicator of \nlong-term nutritional status in the pediatric population. • Low weight for the age indicates acute or chronic malnutrition. It does not differentiate between \nwasting and stunting. Hence, it has limited clinical significance. Note: Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is an age-independent parameter used for screening \nwasting in children. 122 \nSold by @itachibot",

In \nedematous malnutrition, the initial appearance of edema is commonly observed in the feet and \nlower legs, progressing into generalized edema affecting the hands, arms, and face. The skin over \nthe swollen areas may show dark, crackled, peeling patches (flaky paint dermatosis) with pale skin \nunderneath, making it susceptible to infections. There may be sparse and easily pluckable hair. Hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration is a common \nfinding. Associated symptoms of misery, apathy, and loss of appetite are seen in children with \nedema. Other options: Option B: Marasmus is a severe form of wasting characterized by significant loss of fat and muscle \ntissue as the body utilizes these resources for energy. It is often triggered by acute starvation or \nillness in individuals with borderline nutritional status. Option C: Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is a chronic liver disease that affects infants and young \nchildren. Common symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The \ndisease progresses rapidly, leading to the development of cirrhosis. Option D: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium to \nlarge-sized vessels.

The general treatment involves 10 steps in 2 phases: Initial stabilization phase: It focuses on restoring homeostasis and treating medical conditions \nand requires 2-7 days of inpatient treatment. Mnemonic: SHIELDED • Sugar deficiency(hypoglycemia) • Hypothermia • Infection • ELectrolyte imbalance • DEhydration • Deficiency of nutrients Rehabilitation phase: It focuses on rebuilding wasted tissue and generally takes several weeks. Steps: • Treat hypoglycemia (blood glucose level &lt;54 mg/dl): if symptomatic, give 10% Dextrose IV at \n5ml/kg. Feeding should be initiated with starter F-75 (formula with 75 kcal/100 ml of feed) • Treat hypothermia (axillary &lt;35°C or 95°F): Skin-to-skin contact with care called “kangaroo \ntechnique” or dress in warmer clothes, cover head, wrap in a warmed blanket, and provide \nindirect heat. • Treat dehydration: Hydrate with ReSoMal (45 mmol Na/L). It is a low-sodium rehydration \nsolution for malnutrition. 128 \nSold by @itachibot • Correct electrolyte imbalance: There is a deficit of potassium and magnesium and excess \nsodium. Give extra potassium (3 to 4 mEq/kg/day) and magnesium (4 mEq/ kg/day) for at least 2 \nweeks. • Treat an infection: Starting on the first day, give broad-spectrum antibiotics to all children. • Correct micronutrient deficiencies: • Do not give iron in the stabilization phase, because excess iron leads to free radical injury. Give \niron 3 mg/kg/day once the child starts gaining weight after the stabilization phase. • Give vitamin A on day 1. Repeat on day 2 and day 14. • Folic acid 1 mg (5 mg on day 1) • Zinc (2 mg/kg/day) • Copper (0.3 mg/kg/day) • Start cautious feeding: Give ù to 12 small feeds of F75 feeds. It is low-lactose milk that \ncontains 75 kcal and 0.9 g protein per 100 mL. After 3 days, transition to F100 feeds is made \nwhich is called a catch-up diet. This provides 100 kcal and 2.9 g protein per 100 mL. After 1 week, \ncalories are further increased to 150–200 kcal/kg/day and protein to 4–6 g/kg/day. • Rehabilitation: The indications of entry to this phase are reduced/minimal oedema and the \nreturn of appetite. • Beginning of feeding. • After 3 days, the transition to energy-dense feeding • Stimulation of emotional and sensorial development • Transfer to home-based diet",

When accompanied by loose stools, management includes the \nuse of low sodium ORS for rehydration of 5ml/kg every 30 min for the first 2 hours. Management of fluid/electrolyte status in SAM: • Do not give IV fluids unless the child is in shock. • Give ReSoMal (low-sodium rehydration solution for malnutrition) 5 mL/kg every 30 min for the \nfirst 2 hr orally or NG tube. • Then give 5-10 mL/kg in alternate hours for up to 10 hour. The amount depends on stool loss \nand eagerness to drink. Feed every other alternate hour. • Give ReSoMal after each watery stool as a prevention strategy. • Do not continue aggressive hydration even after dehydration resolves. Treatment of hypoglycemia in malnutrition: • If conscious: 10% glucose (50 mL) orally or 1 teaspoon sugar under the tongue, whichever is the \nquickest. • If unconscious: Immediately give sterile 10% glucose (5 mL/kg) by IV.
