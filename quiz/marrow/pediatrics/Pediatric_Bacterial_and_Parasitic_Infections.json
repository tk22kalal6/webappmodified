Scarlet fever is a delayed type of skin reaction to streptococcal exotoxin and occurs as a \ncomplication of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. There is a diffuse erythematous maculopapular \nrash, which blanches on pressure. This gives a sandpaper quality to the skin. A characteristic physical finding in which red or pink petechial lines appear in skin creases is \ncalled Pastia's sign, Pastia lines, or Thompson's sign.

Puhl’s lesion is chronic tuberculosis (TB) of the apex of the \nlung, not seen in the primary infection. 313 \nSold by @itachibot The majority of children develop no signs or symptoms at any level. In primary pulmonary disease, the combination of the parenchymal pulmonary lesion and the \ncorresponding lymph node is called Ghon’s complex or the primary complex. Asymptomatic \npleural effusion is common and forms part of the primary complex. Erosion of a parenchymal \nfocus of tuberculosis into the blood or lymphatic vessel can result in dissemination of the bacilli \nand a miliary pattern, with small nodules evenly distributed on the chest radiograph. Sputum \nsmear-negative TB does not rule out pediatric pulmonary TB. Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is common in children above 7 years of age. The commonest site \nis the apex of the lung—Puhl’s lesion. Regional lymph nodes are not involved. The most common site of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children is the lymph node. NOTE: • Ranke complex: Ghon's complex undergoes fibrosis and calcification. • Simon focus: Hematogenous spread to the apex of the upper lobe, resulting in a post-primary \ninfective lesion, which heals with scarring. • Simmond's focus: Tuberculous focus in the liver. • Weigert focus: Caseating metastatic tuberculous focus in the wall of a pulmonary vein. • Rich focus: Tuberculous granuloma occurring in the cortex of the brain.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of neonatal tetanus. It is caused by a neurotoxin produced \nby Clostridium tetani, which inhibits inhibitory neurons, not excitatory neurons. Clostridium tetani is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe commonly found in soil, dust, and \ngastrointestinal tracts of various animals. The baby's umbilical stump covered with cow dung \nserves as the source of infection. It also occurs in infants of unimmunized mothers. Tetanus \ntypically manifests within 3-12 days of birth as progressive difficulty in feeding, rigidity, or \nspasms. Tetanus toxin binds at the neuromuscular junction and enters the motor nerve; it is then \ntransported to the alpha-motoneuron via retrograde axonal transport. Subsequently, the toxin \nenters the adjacent spinal inhibitory interneurons, where it prevents the release of the \nneurotransmitters glycine and -aminobutyric acid. This leads to blockade of normal antagonistic \nmuscle inhibition, while agonist muscles undergo sustained contraction without relaxing. Neonatal tetanus presents with progressive feeding difficulty (sucking and swallowing), \nirritability, and crying. Characteristic features include reduced movement or complete muscle \nparalysis, rigidity, and spasms. These features may or may not be associated with opisthotonos. Treatment includes supportive care in the form of muscle relaxants (diazepam), along with the \nadministration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) and metronidazole, which is the \nantibiotic of choice. Parenteral penicillin G can serve as an alternate antibiotic. Excising the umbilical stump in a baby with neonatal tetanus is no longer recommended.",

It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Carriers are the most common causes of infection. \nImmunization does not prevent the carrier state. It spreads via droplets through the respiratory \ntract (most important), cutaneous lesions, and fomites. The regulation of toxin production in the bacterium is partially controlled by iron, thus making it \nan important prerequisite for toxin production. Clinical features: • Respiratory tract diphtheria (most common): • Thick, adherent pseudomembrane (grey or white) on one/both tonsils and adjacent pharynx. \nDislodging of the membrane may cause bleeding. • Underlying soft tissue edema and enlarged lymph nodes can cause a bull-neck appearance • Patients with laryngeal diphtheria are at risk for suffocation because of local soft-tissue edema \nand airway obstruction by the diphtheritic membrane. • Cutaneous diphtheria is an indolent, non-progressive infection characterized by a superficial, \necthyma-like, non-healing ulcer with a gray-brown membrane. • Occasionally, it causes mucocutaneous infections at other sites, such as otitis externa, purulent \nconjunctivitis, and vulvo-vaginitis. Diagnosis: The culture of the organism from the nose and throat swab specimens is the gold \nstandard. Demonstration of the toxin is done by Elek's gel precipitation test.
