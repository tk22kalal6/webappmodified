Palmar erythema(redness of the palms) and ascites (swelling of the abdomen) are features of liver \nfailure seen in this patient. Upper GI endoscopy is the preferred diagnostic test for oesophagal varices. The management of acute variceal bleeding- • Attain hemodynamic stability through blood transfusion/fluids • Vasoactive drugs (e.g., octreotide) • Endoscopy to perform ligation or sclerotherapy • Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be considered for variceal bleeding \nrefractory to medical and endoscopic therapy. Secondary prophylaxis to reduce the recurrence of bleeding includes- • Nonselective  blockade (propranolol, nadolol) • Obliteration of varices through serial treatment via ligation or sclerotherapy 391 \nSold by @itachibot",

Thus, an ATP7B deficiency leads to excess deposition of free copper within tissues.

      "explanation": "Biliary atresia is the most common indication for liver transplantation in children. Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is defined as a partial or total absence of permeable bile duct \nbetween the porta hepatis and the duodenum. It is due to inflammatory fibrosis of the biliary \ntree. It leads to obstruction to bile flow thereby causing the leaking of conjugated bilirubin into \nthe circulation. Infants have symptoms of jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine right after birth. In advanced \ndisease, infants present with failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and ascites due to liver cirrhosis. HIDA scan is the investigation of choice for extrahepatic biliary atresia. An intraoperative \ncholangiogram is a gold standard investigation for diagnosis. Children with biliary atresia, who do not achieve successful drainage after \nhepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai's procedure), require liver transplantation within the first year of \nlife.
