Infection is the most well-known \netiology, yet only 30% of ACS episodes will have positive sputum or bronchoalveolar culture. The \nmost common bacterial pathogens implicated are S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and \nChlamydia spp. Oxygen should be supplemented to all patients who demonstrate hypoxia. Blood transfusion is the only method to abort a rapidly progressing episode of ACS. Because of the clinical overlap between pneumonia and ACS, all episodes should be treated \npromptly with antimicrobial therapy, including at least a macrolide and possibly a \nthird-generation cephalosporin.

Globin gene sequencing is used for its definitive diagnosis. 747 \nSold by @itachibot High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a screening test for thalassemia \n(option A). Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains. \nDepending on the chain affected, it is classified into -thalassemia and -thalassemia. -thalassemia is caused by point mutations of the -thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, which \ndiminish the synthesis of -globin chains. Splicing mutations are the most common cause of (+) \nthalassemia. There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an elevation of HbA2 and HbF levels in \n-thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with distinctive facial features such as \nmaxilla hyperplasia, a flat nasal bridge, and frontal bossing. Other manifestations include \npathologic bone fractures, significant hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia. Blood smears show marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. \nTarget cells, basophilic stippling, and fragmented red cells also are common. A radiographic \nimage of the skull shows the classic 'crew cut' appearance. Hb Electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used as screening \ntests for thalassemia. DNA diagnosis to detect -thalassemia mutations is used for definitive \ndiagnosis. The Mentzer index is the ratio of MCV to RBC count. It is used to differentiate between \niron-deficiency anemia and -thalassemia trait. The Mentzer index is &lt;13 in thalassemia minor \nsyndrome. Transfusions are administered every 3-4 weeks to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of \n9.5-10.5 g/dL. Transfusion-induced hemosiderosis is a significant complication in \ntransfusion-dependent thalassemia.

Other lineages are \nunaffected. • Craniofacial anomaly is the most common congenital anomaly seeen. • Hypertelorism, snub nose, and high-arched palate seen. • Thumb abnormalities- flattening of the thenar eminence and triphalangeal thumb • Short stature Treatment: Corticosteroids, chronic red cell transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation.

Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive hemolytic disorder in which acanthocytosis is \nassociated with fat malabsorption, progressive ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa. Acanthocytes or spur cells are spiculated red cells with a few projections of varying size and \nsurface distribution. The most significant associations include abetalipoproteinemia and severe \nliver disease. Note: Do not confuse acanthocytes with echinocytes or burr cells. They appear with multiple small \nprojections that are uniformly distributed on the red cell surface. It is a universal feature of \nuremia. 753 \nSold by @itachibot Image: The peripheral smear below shows regularly spaced, smoothly rounded crenulations, \nwhich are characteristic of a burr cell.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the megaloblastic picture elevated homocysteine levels, and \nnormal methylmalonate levels are suggestive of folate deficiency anemia. Goat’s milk is deficient in folate. So goat milk-fed infants are likely to develop folate deficiency \nanemia. Human breast milk, infant formulas, and pasteurized cow’s milk provide adequate \namounts of folic acid. In folate deficiency anemia, lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum are elevated. Folate-deficient \nmothers do not give birth to infants with folate deficiency because there is a selective transfer of \nfolate to the fetus via the placental folate receptors. Methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate \nmetabolism, and severe cases can produce neurologic and vascular complications; there is no \nassociated megaloblastic anemia. Malnutrition is the most common cause of folate deficiency in children. Note: Both homocysteine and methylmalonate levels are elevated in B12 deficiency anemia.",
