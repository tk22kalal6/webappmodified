      "question": "Question 2: Asha was being bullied about her height in school. The concerned parents bring her to the \npediatrician who plots the growth chart as shown below.

        "d": "Maternal Deprivation Dwarfism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The presence of high GH levels and low insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels point \ntowards Laron syndrome/dwarfism. It is caused by end-organ resistance to growth hormone(GH \ninsensitivity) due to the GH receptor mutation. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder with clinical \nfeatures as those seen in pituitary dwarfism. Here, growth hormone is produced but is unable to act on the target tissues. Thus, the resting and \nstimulated GH levels are high and IGF-1 levels are low. In Turner's syndrome (Option A), loss of the short arm of the X chromosome is implicated in \ndwarfism. The short stature occurs due to a state of GH resistance, relative deficiency, and \ndecreased utilization. Pituitary dwarfism (Option B) is a condition with GH deficiency. Maternal deprivation dwarfism (Option D) is due to psychosocial causes such as emotional \ndeprivation and neglect. There is an inadequate response to GH stimulation tests. The mechanism \nis not fully understood. No history suggestive of disturbed maternal or family relationships rules \nthis out.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Children with growth hormone deficiency usually have normal growth at birth. Growth \nretardation (decline in growth velocity) becomes apparent around 1 year of age. Growth in-utero is dependant on genetic, environmental, nutrition and growth factors. GH levels \npeak at mid-gestation, increase at birth, and then reduce by 2 weeks of life. At around 6 months of \nage, GH levels reach pre-pubertal levels and from there on have a major influence on \ngrowth. Thus the deficiency becomes apparent after a significant period of GH-dependent growth \nhas occurred. Characteristic features of growth hormone deficiency (Pituitary Dwarfism): • Normal growth at birth with growth retardation becoming apparent around 1 year of age • Proportionate short stature • Hypoglycemic seizures in newborn 622 \nSold by @itachibot • Small larynx with a high-pitched voice • Small genitalia (micropenis) • Delayed skeletal maturation • Delayed dentition • Delayed puberty (sexual infantilism) • Doll-like facial appearance: small, round facies, frontal prominence, depressed nasal bridge \n(saddle nose), eyes may bulge, underdeveloped mandible and chin, normal head circumference \nbut craniofacial disproportion due to small facies • Short neck • Normal intelligence.",

Hyperpituitarism causes growth hormone (GH) excess, leading to tall stature (giants) with weak \nmuscles.

Clinical features include: • Gigantism, prognathism (protrusion of jaw), hypertrophy of frontal bones • Proximal myopathy (though there is muscle hypertrophy, it is weakened due to atrophy of type II \nmuscle fibers) • Acral enlargement in hands and feet (due to thickening of soft tissues) • Visceromegaly: Enlargement of most organs especially the tongue, thyroid, salivary gland, liver, \nspleen, kidney, and prostate • Local effects of the adenoma: Headache, visual field defects, raised ICT Note: Although hypothalamic hamartomas can also produce gigantism, the most common cause \nof gigantism is pituitary adenomas.",

      "explanation": "Lesions in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus can cause central \ndiabetes insipidus. These nuclei synthesize vasopressin, a 9-amino-acid peptide with antidiuretic and vascular \npressor activity.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by pathologic polyuria and polydipsia (&gt;2 L/m²/24 hr or \n5 mL/kg/hr). It can result from either: • Vasopressin deficiency (decreased anti-diuretic hormone production) causes central DI. • Vasopressin insensitivity at the level of the kidney causes nephrogenic DI.",
