      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis for the evisceration of bowel loops, coming out of a defect in the \nabdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus is gastroschisis. It occurs when there is a failure in \nthe closure of the body wall in the abdominal region. The defects seen in the ventral body wall include: 45 \nSold by @itachibot • Gastroschisis- The intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall. The defect \nusually lies to one side of the umbilicus (right side commonly). The loops of the bowel are not \ncovered by amnion as they herniate through the abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. \nThe affected bowel loops can be damaged by exposure to amniotic fluid. • Omphalocele- The bowel loops fail to return from the physiologic umbilical hernia. Since the \numbilicus is covered by a reflection of the amnion, the omphalocele is also covered by amnion. • Congenital umbilical hernia- This is due to a failure of the umbilical ring to close after \nphysiologic herniation of the intestines. Ectopia Vesicae/ Bladder exstrophy is a congenital abnormality that occurs when the lower \nabdominal wall does not form properly and the bladder is open and exposed.",

      "explanation": "The video clip of a 2-day-old neonate exhibiting repetitive, rhythmic movement in unilateral \nupper and lower limbs suggests a neonatal seizure of focal clonic type. A focal clonic seizure is characterized by multiple, repetitive, rhythmic contractions of muscle \ngroups of the limbs, face, or trunk, maybe unifocal or multifocal. It may occur synchronously or \nasynchronously in muscle groups on one side of the body. It may occur simultaneously but \nasynchronously on both sides. It cannot be suppressed by restraint. Other options: Option A: Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained posturing of a single limb, sustained \nasymmetrical posturing of the trunk, and sustained eye deviation. They cannot be provoked by \nstimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option C: Spasms are sudden generalized jerks lasting 1-2 sec and are usually associated with a \nsingle, very brief, generalized discharge. They may be flexor, extensor, or mixed extensor/flexor \nand can occur in clusters. They too cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option D: Subtle seizures include transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking, mouthing, \nabnormal extremity movements (rowing, swimming, cycling, pedalling), fluctuations in heart rate, \nhypertension episodes, and apnea. They are more common in preterm than in term babies. Myoclonic seizures are random, single, rapid muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk. \nThey are not repetitive or may recur at a slow rate. They can be generalized, focal, or fragmentary. \nThey can be provoked by stimulation. Clinically apparent seizures in a neonate should be treated if they last &gt;3 minutes or are brief \nserial seizures.
