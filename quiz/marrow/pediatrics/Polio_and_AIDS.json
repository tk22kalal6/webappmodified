      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Poliovirus mainly affects the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata (cranial \nnerve nuclei), causing lower motor neuron (LMN) type of paralysis. It damages motor and \nautonomic nerves; sensory nerves are not involved. Poliovirus is a non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae \nfamily. Three antigenically distinct serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) are known. Ages 6 months to 5 \nyears are most commonly affected. The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and has an \nincubation period of 8-12 days. Humans are the only known reservoir for the polioviruses. The virus colonizes and replicates in the GI mucosa (M cells), followed by entry into the blood via \nregional lymph nodes. In blood, it causes viremia and gets access to the CNS via the peripheral \nnerves, finally reaching the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. Most cases are subclinical. Some have minor illnesses like fever, sore throat, headache, and \nmalaise. It can present as non-paralytic polio (aseptic meningitis) or paralytic polio (flaccid \nparalysis with absent deep tendon reflexes). Most frequently, the completely affected muscle is \nthe tibialis anterior. It is asymmetric paralysis which is more severe if strenuous physical exercise \noccurred during the onset of paralysis. Death usually occurs due to respiratory paralysis. Vaccination schedule for polio: 286 \nSold by @itachibot • Live attenuated: oral polio vaccine (OPV) (Sabin) at birth (day 0); then boosters at 6, 10, and 14 \nweeks and at 15-18 months; additional doses till 5 years • Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (Salk) given intradermally; two fractional doses at 6 and 14 weeks \nas well as 9 months of age.",

        "b": "Type 2 virus",
        "c": "Type 3 virus",
        "d": "Type 4 virus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Most of the outbreaks of paralytic polio are caused by the type 1 virus. Three antigenically distinct serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) of poliovirus are known. Poliovirus type 1 \nhas historically been the predominant cause of poliomyelitis worldwide and continues to be \ntransmitted in endemic areas. Most infections with poliovirus are asymptomatic. Rarely, patients can have the following \npresentations: • Abortive poliomyelitis - a minor illness, manifested by fever, malaise, sore throat, or headache. • Non-paralytic poliomyelitis - manifested by aseptic meningitis. • Paralytic poliomyelitis - aseptic meningitis followed by severe back, neck, and muscle pain with \nrapid/gradual onset of motor weakness. It is the least common presentation of poliovirus \ninfection. Wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999. Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV (circulating \nvaccine-derived polioviruses) cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. Bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains serotypes 1 and 3. Serotype 2 has been removed, as it is \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of cVDPV and occasionally vaccine-associated paralytic polio \n(VAPP). Note: On 25 April 2016, India switched from trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV; this day \nis called the National switch day.",

Usually, \nthe head will also raise, but in the case of poliomyelitis, the head drops backward.",

Note: • VAPP: Vaccine-associated paralytic polio • VDPV: Vaccine-derived polio virus. A very rare strain of polio virus, genetically changed from \nthe original strain contained in OPV. • cVDPV: circulating vaccine-derived polio virus.

      "explanation": "Vaginal cleansing before delivery is least likely to prevent the perinatal transmission of HIV. Methods to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV include the following: • Antiretroviral therapy (ART): • Single-dose nevirapine at the onset of labor followed by a single dose to the newborn within 72 \nhours of birth. • Zidovudine can also be used from the 2nd trimester onwards throughout pregnancy and for 6 \nweeks after birth to infancy. • Breastfed infants should receive NVP for 6 weeks if the mother is receiving cART, or NVP for the \nduration of breastfeeding if the mother is not on therapy. Formula-fed infants in resource-limited \ncountries should receive ZDV bid or NVP qd for 6 weeks. • Elective cesarean section* • Breastfeeding: Usually contraindicated, except in developing countries where breastfeeding may \nbe continued for 6 months. *Note: Maternal cART is documented to decrease the rate of perinatal HIV-1 transmission to &lt;2%, and \n&lt;1% if the mother’s viral RNA level is &lt;1,000 copies/mL at delivery. Thus, elective C-section \nat 38 weeks of gestation should be considered only for women whose viral load is &gt;1,000 \ncopies/ mL in late gestation, to further reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral drugs during C-section are as follows: • For elective (planned) C-section, ART should be given prior to the operation. • Women on lifelong ART should continue their standard ART regimen. • In case of emergency C-section in pregnant women who are not on ART, the three-drug regimen \nshould be started before the surgery and continued thereafter. 291 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "HIV in a baby born to an HIV-infected mother is diagnosed using HIV DNA PCR. NACO recommends the use of a qualitative HIV-1 DNA PCR (NAT) in children aged &lt;18months Antibody assays (e.g., ELISA) that are commonly used for HIV testing in adults and older children \nare not reliable in infants and young children because of the persistence of transplacentally \nacquired maternal antibodies until 18 months after birth. For this reason, HIV virologic testing \n(PCR) must be performed using tests that detect HIV DNA or RNA. Scheduled repeated testing is \nnecessary because test sensitivity increases with time from HIV virus exposure. Also, a very recent \ninfection will not be detectable by PCR. Cord blood should not be used for testing because of the possibility of contamination of the \nsample with maternal blood.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given image shows, infection through fecal oral route, colonization of the organism, and \nreplication in the GI mucosa (M cells), followed by entry into blood via regional lymph nodes. In \nblood, it causes viremia and gets access to the CNS via the peripheral nerves, finally reaching the \nanterior horn cells in the spinal cord. The pathogenesis expalined above is that of polio infection. Option A: Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is implicated in the pathogenesis of Guillain–Barre \nsyndrome, where the antibodies against C. jejuni cross-react with the gangliosides (GM1) in the \nperipheral nervous system. Option B: Hepatitis A infection occurs through the fecal-oral route, and the virus replicates in the \nGI mucosa and is then transported to the liver. Option D: Rotavirus causes diarrhea by causing malabsorption. 294 \nSold by @itachibot",
