Properties of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) • HbF is resistant to alkali denaturation. • This property forms the basis of the alkali denaturation test (or Apt test) to detect the presence \nof fetal blood in maternal circulation in suspected feto-maternal hemorrhage. • The Kleihauer–Betke test (or acid elution test) is used to quantitate the amount of feto-maternal \nhemorrhage to calculate the dosage of anti-D required in Rh-negative mothers. • HBF accounts for ™0% of the hemoglobin at term. • Increased HbF can be seen in hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, sickle cell anemia, \nbeta-thalassemia, HbC disease, and HbE disease 726 \nSold by @itachibot • HbF has a higher affinity for oxygen. • This allows for gas exchange from maternal circulation by binding to oxygen at a relatively low \noxygen tension in the maternal blood supplying the chorion. • HbF has lower affinity for 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) than HbA. • Lack of interaction between HbF and 2,3 BPG increases the affinity of HbF to oxygen.",

Treatment of ITP: • Mild to moderate bleeding symptoms- watchful expectancy, education, and counseling. • Platelet count &lt; 30,000 + risk factors for bleeding (antiplatelet drugs/anticoagulants or \nconcomitant bleeding disorders)- oral glucocorticoids/ intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or IV \nanti-D • Severe bleeding symptoms- IV methylprednisolone ± IVIG or IV anti-D • Life-threatening bleeding (eg. intracranial hemorrhage)- platelet transfusion + IV \nmethylprednisolone + IVIG or IV anti-D Note: The role of splenectomy in ITP should be reserved for 2 circumstances: • The older child (4 yr) with severe ITP that has lasted &gt;1 year (chronic ITP) and whose \nsymptoms are not easily controlled with therapy • When life-threatening hemorrhage (ICH) complicates acute ITP and the platelet count cannot be \ncorrected rapidly with transfusion of platelets and administration of IVIG and corticosteroids. 728 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common congenital bleeding disorder. VWD is thought to affect approximately 0.1- 1% of the population. It is due to abnormal von \nWillebrand factor (VWF). VWF is an adhesive protein that acts as a bridge between subendothelial collagen and platelets. It \nalso binds and protects the circulating factor VIII from rapid clearance in circulation. Von Willebrand disease is mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (rarely autosomal \nrecessive). The types of disease include quantitatively deficient vWF (partial = type 1 or absolute = \ntype 3) or qualitatively abnormal vWF (type 2 = dysproteinemia). The majority (~ 80%) have type \n1 disease. Hemophilia A (factor 8 deficiency) occurs in 1 in 5,000 males. Hemophilia B (factor 9 deficiency) \noccurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 males.",

The presence of petechiae and purpura at birth, especially after vaginal delivery, along with \nprolonged bleeding time, normal platelet count, normal aPTT are seen in qualitative platelet \ndefect disorders like Bernard-Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The presence of large platelets rules out Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Evans syndrome is an \nautoimmune hemolytic disorder with thrombocytopenia. Von Willebrand's disease doesn't usually \nmanifest at birth. Bernard–Soulier syndrome is an autosomal recessive functional/qualitative platelet disorder. It is \ncharacterized by the deficiency of Gp Ib-IX receptor causing defective platelet adhesion.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The ristocetin-aggregation test is abnormal in both von Willebrand disease and Bernard–Soulier \nsyndrome. All of the above diseases are inherited bleeding disorders affecting platelet function. Hence, there \nis prolonged bleeding time but platelet levels are not significantly affected. Platelet aggregation tests use a panel of platelet agonists (adenosine diphosphate [ADP], \nepinephrine, collagen, and ristocetin) to measure platelet activation and aggregation in vitro. Ristocetin induces the binding of VWF to platelets and agglutinates platelets. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a severe congenital platelet function disorder, is caused by an absence \nor severe deficiency of the VWF receptor on the platelet membrane. Hence, in Bernard–Soulier \nsyndrome, no response (or no aggregation) is seen with ristocetin. The ristocetin-aggregation test is also abnormal in von Willebrand disease. However, it \nnormalizes after the addition of normal plasma (which contains vWF) since there is no defect in \nbinding receptors.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Delayed separation of the umbilical stump beyond 4 weeks is a characteristic finding seen \nin factor XIII deficiency. However, these findings can also be seen in septicemia or local \ninfections. Factor XIII is responsible for the crosslinking of fibrin to stabilize the fibrin clot, symptoms of \ndelayed hemorrhage are secondary to the instability of the clot. Typically, patients have trauma \none day and then have a bruise or hematoma the next day. Results of the usual screening tests for hemostasis are normal in patients with factor XIII \ndeficiency. Screening tests for factor XIII deficiency are based on the observation that there is \nincreased solubility of the clot because of the failure of cross-linking. 733 \nSold by @itachibot Pediatric Anemias",
