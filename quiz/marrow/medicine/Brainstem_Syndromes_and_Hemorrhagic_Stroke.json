      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Gerstmann syndrome. It is commonly associated with \ndamage to the left (dominant) inferior parietal lobule. Gerstmann syndrome consists of: • Acalculia - impairment of simple arithmetic • Dysgraphia - impaired writing • Finger anomia - an inability to name individual fingers • Right-left confusion - an inability to tell whether a hand, foot, or arm of the patient or examiner \nis on the right or left side of the body Option B: Anton syndrome also known as visual anosognosia occurs due to bilateral infarction in \nthe distal PCAs. It produces cortical blindness and the patients are unaware of the blindness or \nmay even deny it. Option C: Millard-Gubler syndrome occurs due to ventral pontine injury. It causes functional loss \nof the 6th and 7th cranial nerves and corticospinal tract. This presents as diplopia, ipsilateral \nfacial palsy, ipsilateral loss of corneal reflex, contralateral hemiparesis. Option D: Dejerine-Roussy syndrome is associated with hemisensory loss and severe burning pain \nin the affected region. It is also known as thalamic pain syndrome.",

Dejerine- Roussy syndrome occurs due to occlusion of the thalamic and thalamogeniculate \nbranches arising from the P1 segment resulting in contralateral hemisensory loss and severe \nburning pain in the affected regions. The P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery extends from the basilar bifurcation to the \njunction with the posterior communicating artery. This pain responds poorly to analgesics.

Patients with an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery can present with symptoms of \noculomotor nerve palsy such as: • Unilateral ptosis (LPS) • Outward eye deviation (MR) • Dilated pupil. The nerves controlling the pupils are located very superficially and these are always affected due \nto the mass effect of the aneurysm. Therefore the pupil sparing third nerve palsies are unlikely to \nbe due to an aneurysm. Pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy is often assumed to be caused by ischemic injuries such as \nhypertension and diabetes mellitus. Expanding unruptured aneurysms can occasionally lead to prodromal symptoms which suggest \nthe location of the aneurysm.",

The image \nof the CT scan reveals a hyperdense crescentic lesion. Mass effect with midline displacement can \nalso be seen. Causes of SDH are: • Trauma • Anticoagulants • Antiplatelets • Alcohol abuse • Shaken baby syndrome. Non-contrast CT is the investigation of choice. Radiographic features of subdural hemorrhage are: • Typically unilateral • Crescent-like distribution (concavo-convex) around the periphery of the brain • Not limited by sutures and can fill dural reflections • Chronic subdural hemorrhage: Crescent-shaped hypodense lesion on axial CT • Acute subdural hemorrhage: Hyperdense collections on CT",

The \npresence of blood in the Sylvian fissure confirms this diagnosis. 1129 \nSold by @itachibot Trauma is the most common cause. However, spontaneous sub-arachnoid bleeding occurs most \noften due to the rupture of a berry aneurysm. Most of them are found in the anterior circulation, \nmostly on the circle of Willis. The three most common locations are: • Terminal ICA • MCA bifurcation • Top of the basilar artery. A non-contrast CT scan is the investigation of choice. LP shows xanthochromatic CSF. Treatment involves clipping or coiling the aneurysm to eliminate the risk of rebleeding.",

The next line of \nmanagement is decompressive surgery. Cerebral edema is a potential complication in 5-10% of patients with strokes, leading to \nobtundation and brain herniation. The severity of edema is highest on the second or third day \nafter the stroke and can last for around 10 days. Medical management may not be successful in case of significant edema or infarcts involving the \ncerebellum. Decompressive surgery is recommended for patients who are less than 60 years old and \nexperience deterioration  48 hours, despite receiving medical therapy. Hypodensity on head CT \nwithin the first 6 hours of stroke onset, involving  one-third of the MCA territory, early midline \nshift, and a diffusion-weighted imaging volume on MRI within 6 hours  80 mL are predictors of \nsevere cerebral edema.",
