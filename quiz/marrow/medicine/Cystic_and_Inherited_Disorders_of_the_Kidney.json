      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in autosomal dominant \npolycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Infections are the second most common cause. ADPKD is usually clinically silent. Many cases remain asymptomatic until the fifth decade of life \nand are diagnosed incidentally. PKD-1 mutations cause more severe disease than PKD-2 \nmutations. The following clinical features may be seen in symptomatic patients: • Abdominal mass • Back or flank pain • Recurrent UTIs - Renal cyst infections by Gram-negative bacteria are common • Nephrolithiasis - most commonly uric acid stones • Hematuria • Cardiac: • Hypertension - early feature • Left ventricular hypertrophy • Mitral valve prolapse, valvular insufficiency 753 \nSold by @itachibot • Extra-renal: • Intracranial aneurysms • Hepatic cysts As the cysts grow they compress on the surrounding normal tissue which leads to a progressive \nreduction in the GFR. Eventually, it leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the fifth decade of \nlife.",

      "question": "Question 2: A 48-year-old woman developed a sudden severe headache and vomiting. Her neighbor \nrushed her to the hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. She lived alone and her \nfamily history is unknown. An autopsy revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage and the \nfollowing findings in her kidneys. Which of the following is incorrect about this condition?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Mutation of PKD-1 is responsible for 85% of cases",
        "b": "PKD-2 mutation has higher risk of end-stage renal disease than PKD-1",

        "d": "Cysts are formed only in 5% of the tubules of the kidney"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and multiple renal cysts is \nsuggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The PKD-1 mutation has a \nhigher risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than PKD-2. ADPKD is a disorder which is characterized by progressive bilateral formation of renal cysts. It is \ncaused by the following mutations: • PKD1 gene on chromosome 16 (85%) - codes for polycystin-1 • PKD2 gene on chromosome 4 (15%) - codes for polycystin-2 Polycystins are transmembrane proteins that are present on the primary cilia of the tubular cells. \nThe mutated proteins in ADPKD alter the normal functioning and triggers cell growth and cyst \nformation. Though cysts are formed only in 5% of the tubules of the kidney, they compress surrounding renal \ntissue due to their enormous growth. This results in loss of renal function.",

      "explanation": "In patients with ADPKD, cysts in the lungs are very rare. There are very few case reports with lung cysts in ADPKD patients, but the association between \nADPKD and lung cysts has not been proved. However, there is a three-fold increase in the \nincidence of bronchiectasis in ADPKD patients. The common extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD include: • Hepatic cysts (50-70%) - most common • Seminal vesicle cysts (40%) - can result in infertility • Arachnoid membrane cysts (8%) - usually asymptomatic, may increase the risk of subdural \nhematoma • Pancreatic cysts (7-36%) • Splenic cysts 754 \nSold by @itachibot",

Hence, contrast-enhanced CT \n(CECT) would usually be avoided due to the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity. The following investigations are done in patients with ADPKD: • USG abdomen - for screening and diagnosis • Non-contrast CT abdomen - more sensitive and picks up cysts of smaller size • MR-angiography of brain - pre-symptomatic screening for intracerebral aneurysms",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A PKHD1 mutation in the deceased infant is suggestive of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney \ndisease (ARPKD). As the woman has signs of oligohydramnios, it is likely that this fetus also has \nARPKD. Severe cases of ARPKD can be diagnosed in-utero with a USG. Prenatal testing can also \nbe done. ARPKD is a hereditary renal disease of childhood caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene on \nchromosome 6. It codes for fibrocystin/ polyductin (FPC), a membrane protein present in the cells \nof the cortical and medullary collecting ducts. Affected fetuses show greatly enlarged kidneys and reduced fetal urine production. This leads to \noligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. About 30% of neonates die soon after birth due to \nrespiratory insufficiency. Most deaths occur &lt; 1 month of life. Others develop chronic kidney \ndisease and hypertension in early childhood.",

It presents with a \nlate-onset, slowly progressive renal failure. Renal cysts are not common but can be seen \noccasionally. Medullary cystic kidney diseases are of two types, MCKD1 and MCKD2. MCKD1 is due to a defect in the mucin 1 (MUC1) gene. The mutated gene codes for a large protein \nfragment that has a toxic effect on the tubules. It is not associated with elevated uric acid levels \nand gout. MCKD2 is due to a defect in the UMOD gene, which codes for the protein uromodulin. It is \nassociated with hyperuricemia and gout.",
