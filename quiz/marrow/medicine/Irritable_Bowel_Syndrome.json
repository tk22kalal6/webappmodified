      "explanation": "The most common pattern in IBS patients is constipation alternating with episodes of diarrhoea. Based on bowel movement patterns, IBS is classified as: • IBS-C: Irritable bowel syndrome-constipation predominant • IBS-D: Irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhoea predominant • IBS-M: Irritable bowel syndrome-mixed 378 \nSold by @itachibot The majority of patients change subtypes over the course of illness. Note: Abdominal pain is a pre-requisite for the diagnosis of IBS. This means that for the diagnosis \nof IBS, recurrent abdominal pain must be present.",

Features in favour of IBS: • Abdominal pain that improves/worsens with defecation • Association with stress or emotional symptoms • Small volume of stools Features not in favour of IBS: • Onset of symptoms in old age • Presence of fever and weight loss • Persistent diarrhoea after a 48h fast • Nocturnal diarrhoea • Steatorrhoea",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Decreased colonic motor potentials are not implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel \nsyndrome (IBS). On the contrary, increased colonic motor potentials are seen. The pathogenesis of IBS is poorly understood. However, the following have been implicated in its \npathogenesis: • Increased colonic motor potentials lead to increased high-amplitude propagating contractions \n(HAPCs) which causes diarrhea. • Visceral hypersensitivity leads to exaggerated sensory responses to visceral stimulation by food. \nThis explains the postprandial symptoms in IBS. • CNS dysregulation - dysfunctional activation of the mid-cingulate cortex and prefrontal lobes \nleads to increased perception of visceral pain. • Abnormal serotonin pathways - serotonin-containing enterochromaffin cells are increased in IBS \npatients. • Altered gut flora 379 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Serotonin is associated with irritable bowel syndrome diarrhoea type (IBS-D). Abnormal serotonin pathways is one of the causes for symptoms in IBS. The serotonin containing \nenterochromaffin cells are increased in a subset of IBS-D patients. This provides a rationale for \nthe use of serotonin antagonists in the treatment of this condition.",

IBS is a clinical diagnosis that can be made without performing many tests if the patient presents \nwith typical symptoms. However, it is recommended to perform the following tests in most \npatients to rule out other conditions: • Complete blood count • Sigmoidoscopic examination • Stool examination for ova and parasites 380 \nSold by @itachibot • 3-week lactose-free diet In patients &gt;40 years, air-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy should also be performed.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Fecal lactoferrin is the marker of IBD that is used to rule out irritable bowel syndrome. Fecal \nlactoferrin is a highly sensitive and specific marker for detecting intestinal inflammation. Fecal calprotectin is another marker of IBD and it is used to rule out irritable bowel syndrome and \nbacterial overgrowth. It correlates well with histologic inflammation, predicts relapses, and \ndetects pouchitis. Option A: Fecal fat is normally digested by pancreatic lipase and absorbed from the jejunum. In \ndisorders of exocrine pancreatic function, fat absorption decreases, resulting in steatorrhea and \nincreased fecal fat. Options C &amp; D: Fecal trypsin, chymotrypsin are pancreatic enzymes, therefore a decrease in \nfecal levels below normal suggests a disorder of the exocrine pancreas.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "FODMAPs are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. FODMAPs stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And \nPolyols. Foodstuff containing lactose, fructose, and sorbitol are some examples of FODMAPs. Since FODMAPs are poorly absorbed, they are fermented by gut bacteria in the colon to produce \ngas and osmotically active carbohydrates. So, a diet low in FODMAPs is recommended to reduce \nsymptoms in IBS patients.",
