      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The above ECG shows a pattern of premature ventricular contractions, one premature beat after \none normal beat. This is seen in ventricular bigeminy. Premature ventricular contractions/beats (PVC) are single ventricular beats that occur earlier than \nthe next normal supraventricular beat. They originate from abnormal foci in the ventricular \ntissue: • Unifocal PVCs arise from a single focus and hence have the same QRS morphology 871 \nSold by @itachibot • Multifocal PVCs arise from multiple foci and therefore have different QRS morphologies They are not preceded by a P wave as they do not originate in the atria. They show wide QRS \ncomplexes (&gt;0.12 ms) on the ECG because they are conducted via normal myocardial tissue \ninstead of the Purkinje system. Ventricular bigeminy refers to a pair of normal and premature ventricular contractions, whereas \nventricular trigeminy refers to a premature beat that occurs after two normal beats. Quadrigeminy \nis when a premature beat follows three normal beats. Few other terms associated with premature ventricular contractions: • Two successive PVCs are known as a couplet • Three successive PVCs are known as a triplet. The given ECG shows ventricular bigeminy with premature beats circled in red and normal \nventricular contractions circled in green.",

      "explanation": "The ECG feature of ventricular tachycardia seen in the given image is a fusion beat. It occurs when \na sinus and ventricular beat coincide to produce a hybrid complex. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as  3 consecutive premature ventricular contractions at a \nrate of &gt;100/min. It is characterized by: • Wide QRS complex • AV dissociation- Atrial activity independent of ventricular activity, seen on the ECG as every p \nwave not followed by QRS complex • Fusion beats- occur when a sinus and ventricular beat coincide to produce a hybrid complex • Capture beats occur when the SA node transiently ‘captures’ the ventricles, that is, ventricles are \ndepolarized by the impulses from the SA node producing a QRS complex of normal duration. 872 \nSold by @itachibot The given ECG shows a fusion beat (red arrow), and a capture beat (green arrow) can also be seen: The given image shows capture beats in VT: Option C: Polymorphic QRS, that is, continuously changing QRS morphology is seen in \npolymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a man with history of coronary artery disease developing \nsyncope. The ECG shows wide QRS complex (&gt; 0.12 s) tachycardia with a single QRS \nmorphology suggestive of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The most appropriate \ntreatment of VT in a hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg) patient \nis DC cardioversion. VT can be casued by structural heart disease, scar-related reentry, cardiomyopathies, or \nabnormalities in the conduction pathways. VT is said to be sustained if it lasts for at least 30 \nseconds or requires intervention for termination. 874 \nSold by @itachibot Rapid VT can lead to hypotension and syncope, especially in patients with ventricular \ndysfunction. Patients with normal cardiac function may tolerate sustained VT, presenting with \npalpitations. Monomorphic VT associated with structural heart disease can progress to ventricular \nfibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac arrest. QRS synchronous electrical cardioversion is performed for unstable patients. Intravenous \namiodarone is the preferred drug for stable VT associated with heart disease. After restoring sinus rhythm, further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying heart \ndisease. Treatment options include antiarrhythmic medications, catheter ablation, or implantable \ncardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for recurrent or high-risk VT. ICDs are commonly used for \nsecondary prevention of sudden death in patients with sustained VT and structural heart disease.",

Idioventricular rhythm is defined as  3 consecutive premature ventricular contractions with a \nheart rate of &lt;50 bpm. If the heart rate is 60-100 bpm, it is known as accelerated idioventricular \nrhythm, and if it is more than 100 bpm it is known as ventricular tachycardia. It may be the result \nof an abnormal focus in the ventricle that generates an impulse faster than the sinus node and \ntherefore assumes control. Other causes of AIVR include: • Buerger disease • Congenital heart disease • Dilated cardiomyopathy • Myocarditis • Drugs: Digoxin toxicity, cocaine toxicity, and various anesthesia agents • Electrolyte abnormality • Postresuscitation Episodes of AIVR have not been found to affect prognosis in acute MI and usually do not require \nintervention. If AIVR is accompanied by hemodynamic compromise, treatment with atropine or \natrial pacing will often suppress the rhythm. 875 \nSold by @itachibot",

Torsades de pointes means twisting of points, it implies twisting of the QRS complexes around the \nisoelectric line of the ECG. It is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that is seen in \npatients with a prolonged QT interval. A prolonged QT interval usually results from prolonged ventricular repolarization (lengthening of \nT wave). A premature ventricular contraction falling in the elongated T wave can initiate torsades \nde pointes. The features of torsades de pointes are: • Polymorphic QRS complexes that change in amplitude • Cycle length giving an appearance of oscillations around the baseline • QT prolongation 877 \nSold by @itachibot",

In this example, for every 5 'P' waves, \nthere are only 4 'QRS' complexes; hence, this is a 5:4 Wenckebach block.",

It can also cause premature \natrial and ventricular beats, sinus bradycardia, paroxysmal atrial or junctional tachycardia, \natrioventricular block, and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Other options: Option B: Hyperkalemia causes tall peaked T waves with a shortened QT interval. There is a \nprogressive lengthening of the PR interval and QRS duration with an increase in potassium levels, \neventually leading to the disappearance of the P wave; and widening of the QRS complex to a sine \nwave pattern. 886 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval. There is a lengthening of the ST \nsegment, while the T wave (which correlates with the time for repolarization) remains unaltered.
