Other options: Option A: The risk of thrombosis strongly correlates with erythrocytosis, not the degree of \nthrombocytosis. Option C: In polycythemia vera, there is an increased risk of H.pylori infection. Option D: Thrombosis is the major cause of mortality in polycythemia vera. The incidence of acute \nleukemia in patients not exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy is low. PV is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which red cells, granulocytes &amp; platelets \naccumulate in the absence of a physiological stimulus. The most common mutation seen in PV is \nthe JAK2 mutation. Clinical features of polycythemia vera are: • Thrombosis is the most common manifestation and is the major cause of mortality. \nUncontrolled erythrocytosis causes increased viscosity of the blood causing thrombosis of the \nvessels. Patients may present with stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and \nBudd-Chiari syndrome. • Aquagenic pruritis is generalized itching following a warm bath or a shower due to increased \nmast cells and histamine. 1336 \nSold by @itachibot • Erythromelalgia is erythema and pain in the fingers, hands, and feet due to increased platelet \nstickiness. • Splenomegaly due to increased destruction of RBCs in the spleen • Gout is due to the excessive proliferation of the marrow cells leading to elevated uric acid levels.",
