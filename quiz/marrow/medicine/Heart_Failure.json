Natriuretic peptides are protein molecules that are secreted by the ventricular myocytes in \nresponse to volume or pressure overload. Ventricular musculature releases pre-proBNP which is \ncleaved into active BNP and inert NT-proBNP. BNP causes natriuresis, vasodilatation, and diuresis that leads to improved myocardial \nrelaxation. These peptides also counteract the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem.

Options B and C: Spironolactone (K+ sparing diuretic) and enalapril (ACE inhibitor) can cause \nhyperkalemia. The first step in managing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is addressing the factors \nthat caused the decompensation. They include nonadherence to medications, dietary indiscretion, \nmedication use that exacerbates heart failure, coronary ischemia, arrhythmias, valvular heart \ndisease, infection, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Volume management is crucial in ADHF. Intravenous loop diuretics are used to relieve \ncongestion. The effectiveness of diuretic therapy can be assessed by changes in weight, \nimprovement in symptoms, and clinical examination findings. Natriuretic peptide levels can also \nhelp assess the adequacy of therapy and predict risk. Cardiorenal syndrome, characterized by the interplay between heart and kidney dysfunction, is a \ncommon complication of ADHF. Diuretic therapy should be carefully managed to avoid worsening \nrenal function in patients with elevated right-sided filling pressures. In cases of severe low cardiac \noutput, inotropic therapy or mechanical circulatory support may be necessary to preserve or \nimprove renal function temporarily. Vasodilators like nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and nesiritide (recombinant BNP) are used \nto reduce filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. Inotropic therapy with drugs like dopamine and milrinone is used to increase myocardial \ncontractility and improve cardiac output in patients with low-output ADHF. Dopamine has \ndose-dependent effects on different receptors, while milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor.",
