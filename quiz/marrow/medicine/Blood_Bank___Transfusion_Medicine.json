      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The blood group 'antigen A' is composed of N-acetyl galactosamine attached to the H substance. H substance is formed by the addition of fucose to the glycolipid or glycoprotein backbone. It is \npresent in all blood groups, even the O group. A antigen = N-acetyl galactosamine + H substance B antigen = galactose + H substance However, in case of the Bombay phenotype, RBCs lack H antigen. Hence, these individuals have \nanti-A, anti-B, and anti-H antibodies. The only compatible blood donor is another person with the \nBombay blood group.",

Multiparous women are frequently implicated \ndonors. Recipients with a history of liver disease, smoking, alcohol use are at a higher risk.

Each mmol of citrate generates 3 mEq of bicarbonate \n(a total of 23 mEq of bicarbonate due to each unit of blood). Metabolic acidosis can also be seen in multiple blood transfusions as citrate is acidic, but \nmetabolic alkalosis is more common. 1474 \nSold by @itachibot HIV / AIDS - Epidemiology and Clinical Features",
