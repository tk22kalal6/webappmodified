      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Restitution is an epithelial mucosal defense mechanism. It is the process by which healthy surface \nepithelial cells from the adjoining areas migrate to restore a damaged region of the gastric \nmucosa. The gastric mucosa has well-established mucosal defense mechanisms against various assaults \nlike HCl, pepsin, alcohol, etc. These include: • Pre-epithelial defense: A layer of mucous over the surface epithelium. This is secreted by the \nsurface epithelium and contains HCO3- which maintains neutral pH at the cell surface • Epithelial defense: It is constituted by the surface epithelial cells and their intercellular tight \njunctions that perform the following functions • Act as a physical barrier • Restitution is the migration of healthy cells to damaged areas • Rapid renewal of surface epithelial layer • Generating factors that prevent cellular damage such as heat shock proteins • Sub-epithelial defense: • Rich microvascular bed of the gastric submucosa that provides HCO3- and washes away the \ntoxic metabolites. 356 \nSold by @itachibot • Alkaline tide- It is caused by the release of HCO3- into the gastric capillaries by the parietal cells. \nThis HCO3- helps in the quick neutralization of HCl.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The NSAIDs impair the mucosal defense mechanism primarily by inhibiting prostaglandin \nsynthesis. NSAIDs also decrease nitric oxide synthesis and have an irritant effect on the gastric mucosa but \ninhibition of COX enzymes/ prostaglandin synthesis is the most prominent factor. Almost all the mucosal defense mechanisms are primarily mediated by prostaglandins synthesized \nby the gastric mucosal cells. Apart from the prostaglandins, the other factors that play a role in \nmucosal defense include: • Nitric oxide (NO)- Causes vasodilation thereby increasing the mucosal blood flow. • Several growth factors like EGF, TGF, FGF- Play a role in epithelial regeneration and restitution.",

      "explanation": "Antral predominant gastritis is associated with duodenal ulcers. Antral predominant gastritis is \nassociated with increased acid production by the parietal cells.

H. pylori infection may result in the following patterns of gastritis: 357 \nSold by @itachibot • Non-atrophic pangastritis- mostly asymptomatic and sometimes associated with MALToma. • Corpus predominant gastritis- affects the corpus and causes atrophy. This leads to the loss of \nacid-producing parietal cells that are primarily found in the corpus. Hence, it is associated with \ndecreased acid production. This is also a predisposing factor for the development of gastric \ncancer. • Antral predominant gastritis- spares the parietal cells. Hence, it is associated with increased acid \nproduction. Option A: Autoimmune gastritis is caused due to autoantibodies against the parietal cells. It is not \nassociated with H. pylori.
