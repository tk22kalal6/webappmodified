      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Vasopressin acts on the V2 receptor using cAMP as its second messenger. Vasopressin acts on GPCR using different second messengers to accomplish its various actions as \nfollows: • V1 receptor - vasoconstriction using phospholipase C as its second messenger • V2 receptor - reabsorption of water through aquaporin 2, using cAMP as its second messenger 53 \nSold by @itachibot Vasopressin has a maximum effect on the collecting ducts. It acts by inserting aquaporin \n2 present in cytoplasmic vesicles of principal cells on to the apical membrane.",

      "explanation": "Nitric oxide mediates its action via cyclic GMP or cGMP. cGMP is the second messenger associated with smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Atrial \nnatriuretic factor (ANF) and NO (nitric oxide) are the only hormones that mediate their action via \ncGMP. Note: Recent studies show that NO is a hormone. NO, which functions as a chemical messenger, \nhas similar properties to hormones (which are known as the body's chemical messengers).",
