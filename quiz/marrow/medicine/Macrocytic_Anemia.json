      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given image shows hypersegmented neutrophils (&gt; 5 nuclear lobes), which are seen \nin megaloblastic anemia. Chronic alcoholism causes non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is a form of macrocytic anemia with impaired nucleic acid metabolism and \ndefective erythropoiesis. The causes include vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and orotic \naciduria. Nuclear maturation lags behind cytoplasmic maturation giving the appearance of \nhypersegmented neutrophils. Peripheral smear findings include: • Oval macrocytes 1300 \nSold by @itachibot • Anisocytosis • Hypersegmented neutrophils Other features of ineffective erythropoiesis seen in megaloblastic anemias include: • Howell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants in red cells. They are usually single, round, dark \npurple-red in color and peripheral in location, as shown below. • Basophilic stippling refers to blue granules of various sizes dispersed throughout the cytoplasm \nof the red cell. They represent ribosomal precipitates. • Cabot rings are red cell inclusions appearing as fine, purple filamentous loops or figure-of-eight \nforms, as shown below. They are presumed to be remnants of mitotic spindles.",

Small amounts of blood loss during the attachment of hookworms to the intestinal \nmucosa can cause iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor (IF) complex is absorbed in the ileum. Tropical sprue, \nDiphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm) infection and Crohn's disease affect the ileum leading to \ndefective absorption of vitamin B12.",

The following autoantibodies are seen: • Type I or blocking antibodies - prevent the combination of IF and cobalamin • Type II or binding antibodies - prevent attachment of IF to the ileal mucosa • Anti-parietal cell antibodies - target the gastric proton pump located in these cells This leads to the deficiency of the intrinsic factor of Castle (IF) and hydrochloric acid produced by \nthe parietal cells. The resulting atrophic gastritis causes high gastrin and low pepsinogen \nlevels. Lack of IF further causes vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia.",

In patients with \ncombined deficiency of B12 and folate, B12 deficiency must always be corrected first. This is \nbecause the administration of folate supplements may improve hematologic abnormalities \nbut worsens neurological manifestations. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is as follows: • Replenishment of body stores: Six 1000-g IM injections of hydroxocobalamin given at 3- to \n7-day intervals. 1305 \nSold by @itachibot • Maintenance therapy: 1000 g hydroxocobalamin IM once every 3 months Treatment of folate deficiency is as follows: • 5–15 mg oral folic acid daily for a minimum of 4 months.
