These usually \npresent as a single lump in the stomach and are formed by ectopic pancreatic tissue. 441 \nSold by @itachibot Thickened gastric folds can represent a local malignant process, inflammatory process, or \nhormonal response. The differential diagnoses of large gastric folds include: • Menetrier's disease • Zollinger–Ellison syndrome - hypergastrinemia leads to parietal cell hyperplasia and prominent \nfolds • Malignancy- lymphoma, infiltrating gastric cancer • Infections- histoplasmosis, tuberculosis.",

Foveolar hyperplasia results in the development of large rugal folds in the body and fundus of the \nstomach, sparing the antrum.

      "explanation": "The given case scenario and endoscopy image showing large, rugal gastric folds are suggestive of \nMenetrier's disease. Among the given options, hematemesis is least likely to occur in this patient. Large, gastric rugal folds in Menetrier's disease occur due to massive overgrowth of mucous \ncells (foveolar cells) lining the stomach. Patients usually present with epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, peripheral \nedema, and weight loss. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding may occur, but overt bleeding is \nunusual. If overt bleeding is seen, it is usually due to superficial mucosal erosions. 442 \nSold by @itachibot They develop protein-losing gastropathy, leading to hypoproteinemia as a result of increased \nsecretion of gastric mucus. There is also a decrease in the number of parietal cells which leads to \ndecreased acid secretion (hypochlorhydria) in the stomach. They are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping gastric carcinoma.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the image showing foveolar hyperplasia are suggestive of \nMenetrier's disease. The treatment of choice is cetuximab. Increased epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) signaling has been implicated in the \npathogenesis of Menetrier's disease. Cetuximab is an EGFR inhibitor, and blocks this signaling \npathway and helps in the improvement of the symptoms. Therefore, it is the first line of \ntreatment. Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole) and somatostatin analogues \n(octreotide) may also be tried to manage symptoms. If the patient continues to have protein loss \ndespite medical therapy, then total gastrectomy is indicated.

The majority of the cases of MALToma are associated with H. pylori induced chronic gastritis. \nThis infection results in an increased proliferation of lymphocytes in the mucosa of the stomach \ncausing MALToma. It is initially low grade and if the infection is not treated, it later progresses to \nhigh grade. The patients usually present with non-specific symptoms like epigastric pain and discomfort. It is \nusually diagnosed in patients around 60 years of age. It is also associated with autoimmune \ndiseases like Sjogren's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

The diagnosis is confirmed by immunophenotyping. 445 \nSold by @itachibot Histopathological examination of a MALToma shows the presence of lymphoepithelial \nlesions. These are caused due to the invasion of gastric glands and crypts by the neoplastic \nlymphocytes. These lymphocytes are positive for CD19, CD20 and negative for CD5 and CD10. \nBiopsy or aspiration of the bone marrow is also done to see the bone marrow involvement. Radiological investigations like CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans are useful in identifying the extent \nof the tumor and infiltration of the tumor to the adjacent organs. Note: Cytogenetic testing will be helpful in identifying chromosomal abnormalities. The image given below shows the histopathological appearance of a MALToma.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of a low-grade gastric MALToma. The treatment of choice for \nthis condition is H. pylori eradication therapy which can be done with the OCM \nregimen (omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole). Immunophenotyping in MALTomas shows positive staining for CD19 and CD20 which is \nsuggestive of a B-cell neoplasm. Negative staining for CD5 and CD10 is seen, suggesting it arises \nfrom the marginal zone of lymphoid tissues. Chronic infection with H. pylori leads to the development of MALTomas. When these lesions are \nlimited to the mucosa, treatment of the infection alone is sufficient to cause regression of the \ntumour. In high-grade tumors or the tumors which invade into the adjacent or distant organs, \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy are required to treat the tumor. Radiotherapy is usually \nthree-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of \nMALToma are rituximab, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, doxorubicin, vincristine, and \nprednisone. Radical gastrectomy has a limited role and is done when the disease is confined to the \nstomach.",

It \nis common in older women, and they usually have a history of smoking, coronary artery disease, \ncerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease. The important clinical features of chronic mesenteric ischemia are: 447 \nSold by @itachibot • Postprandial abdominal pain occurs as a result of a mismatch between the increased demand \nand decreased blood flow to the intestine. This is called intestinal angina • Weight loss- patients avoid eating due to postprandial pain and this leads to significant weight \nloss • Diarrhea- occurs as a result of decreased absorption • Physical examination may reveal epigastric bruit in almost half of the patients. The gold standard investigation to diagnose the blockade is mesenteric angiography. Once the \ndisease is confirmed, the patients have to be started with antiplatelets and mesenteric angioplasty \nand stenting should be performed. Option A: Acute mesenteric ischemia present with acute abdomen, bloody diarrhea and nausea. \nAngiography will show occlusion of superior mesenteric artery.
