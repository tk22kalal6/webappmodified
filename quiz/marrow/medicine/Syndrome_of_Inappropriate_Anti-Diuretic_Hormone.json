      "question": "Question 1: Which of the following findings will you not expect to see in a patient with SIADH?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Normal serum urea and creatinine levels",
        "b": "Low uric acid levels",
        "c": "Hypernatremia",
        "d": "Normal blood pressure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "SIADH does not cause hypernatremia. SIADH is the most common cause of euvolemic \nhyponatremia. The excess ADH secreted leads to the gain of water in the body. This stimulates baroreceptors to \nrelease atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP leads to the loss of water and salt in the urine, \nleading to urine sodium level of &gt; 20 mEq/L in these patients. Thus, the level of water reaches a \nsteady state (euvolemia) but the urinary loss of sodium continues to occur, giving rise to \nhyponatremia. SIADH is characterized by low levels of uric acid, normal blood pressure, and normal urea and \ncreatinine levels. SIADH is diagnosed based on the following criteria (Bartter-Schwartz criteria): 1. Reduced serum osmolality 2. Urine osmolality &gt; Serum osmolality 3. Clinical euvolemia 4. Increased levels of urinary sodium 5. Absence of other causes of hyponatremia like pituitary, renal, adrenal, thyroid or liver diseases.",

After the initial workup, he is \ndiagnosed to have syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). This condition is \ncharacterized by which of the following findings?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Hyponatremia and urine sodium excretion &gt; 20 mEq/L",

        "d": "Hypernatremia and urine sodium excretion &lt; 20 mEq/L"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) is associated with increased urinary \nexcretion of sodium (urine sodium excretion &gt; 20 mEq/L), and hyponatremia. Small cell lung cancer is commonly associated with SIADH due to the ectopic release of \nantidiuretic hormone.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of cerebral salt wasting. Both SIADH and cerebral salt wasting \ncause hyponatremia, but polyuria happens in cerebral salt wasting. Cerebral salt wasting results from hypersecretion of atrial natriuretic peptide. It is seen primarily \nwith central nervous system disorders including brain tumors, head trauma, hydrocephalus, \nneurosurgery, cerebrovascular accidents, and brain death. It is associated with hyponatremia, \npolyuria and elevated urinary sodium excretion. Treatment is by restoring intravascular volume \nwith sodium chloride and water.

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of acute symptomatic SIADH and this condition is best treated by \nthe infusion of hypertonic (3%) saline. This mode of treatment also helps in the correction of \nsodium deficiency that is partly responsible for hyponatremia. The other form of treatment is to help reduce the concentration of body water by giving an AVP \nreceptor-2 antagonist, conivaptan. Conivaptan blocks the antidiuretic effect of AVP and increases \nurine output. 96 \nSold by @itachibot DDAVP is a synthetic analog of AVP and should not be used as it will further increase water \nretention.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The drug of choice for the treatment of chronic SIADH is tolvaptan. Vaptans are selective V2 receptor antagonists that act by increasing urinary water excretion by \nblocking the antidiuretic effect of AVP. Treatment options for chronic SIADH include: • Restriction of fluid intake to below the level of urine output - This is considered the mainstay of \ntreatment. But it also has certain disadvantages as stated below, and hence adding on a drug like \nvaptan is necessary in most cases. • Tolvaptan • Demeclocycline • Fludrocortisone Advantages of vaptans over fluid restriction: • Fluid restriction is usually a burden to the patient, unreliable, impractical, and slow to work. • Increased thirst is a frequently observed characteristic of hyponatremia in SIADH, and is \nparticularly difficult to suppress. Hence, water restriction in SIADH frequently leads to \nnon-compliance in the long run.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Rapid correction of hyponatremia may result in central pontine myelinolysis. Central pontine myelinolysis is an osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), wherein rapid \ncorrection of hyponatremia results in water being driven out of the cell which has adapted to a \nchronic state of hypotonicity, leading to damage to the myelin sheath of these cells. It is characterized by the acute onset of quadriparesis, ataxia, and abnormal extraocular \nmovements. 97 \nSold by @itachibot Thyroid Disorders - Clinical Features",
