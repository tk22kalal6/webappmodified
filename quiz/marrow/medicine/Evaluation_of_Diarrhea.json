      "question": "Question 1: A patient presents with chronic diarrhea, bloating sensation, and weight loss. History is \nsignificant for stools that are bulky, pale, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. Further testing \nreveals fecal fat excretion of 8.2g/day. Which of the following would be a differential \ndiagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Short bowel syndrome",
        "b": "Primary lactase deficiency",
        "c": "Pernicious anemia",
        "d": "Wilson's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of steatorrhoea, which is seen in short bowel syndrome. Steatorrhoea is defined as excess fat in stools (&gt;7g/day) due to poor absorption of lipids. It is \ncharacterized by stools are bulky, pale, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a malabsorption disorder caused by a lack of functional small \nintestine. It can lead to the typical features of malabsorption such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, \nsteatorrhoea, weight loss and anaemia. Option B: Primary lactase deficiency leads to defective absorption of lactose. It does not affect \nlipid absorption. Option C: Pernicious anemia is due to an absence of gastric parietal cell-intrinsic factor which is \nnecessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Option D: Wilson's disease is associated with increased absorption of copper and is not a part of \nmalabsorption syndrome.",

      "question": "Question 2: A 22-year-old man presented with diarrhea and intolerance to dairy products. On \ninvestigation, he was found to have a lactase deficiency. Which of the following agents is least \nlikely to cause symptoms of lactose intolerance?",
      "options": {

        "c": "Yogurt",
        "d": "Ice Cream"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Yogurt is the least likely to cause symptoms of lactose intolerance. It contains lactobacillus that \nproduces lactase and is generally well tolerated. Lactase is a brush border enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose. In lactase \ndeficiency, patients have great variability in clinical symptoms, depending on both the severity of \nlactase deficiency and the amount of lactose ingested. The goal of treatment in patients with isolated lactase deficiency is achieving patient comfort \nthrough the elimination of dietary lactose. Foods that are high in lactose include milk (12 g/cup), ice cream (9 g/cup), and cottage cheese (8 \ng/cup). Aged cheese has lower lactose content. Most people can tolerate up to 12g of lactose a day 368 \nSold by @itachibot without significant symptoms.",

        "c": "Delayed gastric emptying decreases the symptoms",
        "d": "Rapid small-intestinal transit time decreases the symptoms"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Rapid small-intestinal transit time increases the symptoms of lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance can be due to: • Primary lactase deficiency- a genetically determined deficiency or absence of lactase enzyme • Secondary lactase deficiency- due to small intestinal mucosal diseases such as celiac disease Factors affecting symptoms of lactose intolerance: • Amount of lactose in the diet. • Rate of gastric emptying- symptoms are more likely when gastric emptying is rapid \n(post-gastrectomy and skimmed milk intake). • Small intestinal transit time- more rapid small intestinal transit time makes symptoms more \nlikely. • Antibiotic use- results in decreased colonic microflora which in turn decreases the production of \neasily absorbed short-chain fatty acids from non-absorbed lactose. This can worsen the symptoms.",

In patients with diarrhea, stool \nosmolality is always &gt;290-300 mOsm/kg H2O. A stool osmolality of &lt;290 mOsm/kg H2O is \nsuggestive of dilution with urine or water to the sample, by the patient. In this case stool \nosmolality can be lower than plasma osmolality (&lt;250 mOsm/kg) or very high (&gt;400 \nmOsm/kg) due to purposeful dilution with hypotonic/concentrated solute by the patient to the \nstool sample. The stool osmolar gap is used to differentiate between osmotic and secretory diarrhea. A gap of: • &lt;50 suggests secretory diarrhoea • &gt;100 suggests osmotic diarrhoea Stool osmolar gap = measured osmolality - calculated osmolality = (290 to 300) - 2 (stool Na+ + stool K+)",
