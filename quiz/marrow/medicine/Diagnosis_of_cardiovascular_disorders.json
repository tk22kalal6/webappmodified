The typical JVP finding here is absent y-descent. JVP shows a prominent x (early systolic) descent and an absent y (early diastolic) descent because \nof the ventricle's limited or absent early diastolic filling. JVP is almost always elevated in cardiac \ntamponade and may be associated with venous distention in the forehead and scalp. There may be reductions in the amplitude of the QRS complexes, and electrical alternans of the P, \nQRS, or T waves in cardiac tamponade. Note: Alternation of QRS complexes, usually in a 2:1 ratio, on ECG is called electrical alternans. It \nis caused by the movement of the heart in the pericardial space. Electrical alternans is also seen in \npatients with myocardial ischemia, acute pulmonary embolism, and tachyarrhythmias.",

      "explanation": "Water hammer pulse, also known as Corrigan’s pulse, is characterized by a sharp rise and a rapid \nfall-off and is seen in aortic regurgitation (AR) due to the fact that arterial pressure falls rapidly in \nlate systole and early diastole. In AR, the pulse pressure is widened due to systolic hypertension and decreased diastolic \npressure. The diastolic pressure is measured at Korotkoff phase IV. In certain patients with AR or \na combination of aortic stenosis (AS) and AR, the carotid arterial pulse may exhibit a bisferiens \npattern, characterized by two systolic waves separated by a trough. The apical impulse is heaving and displaced inferiorly. A diastolic thrill may be palpable along the \nleft sternal border. A2 is usually absent in AR. An early diastolic murmur can be auscultated in chronic AR. It is best \nheard in the third intercostal space along the left sternal edge. 794 \nSold by @itachibot Severe AS (Option A) would show pulsus parvus et tardus, characterized by the carotid pulse \nrising slowly to a delayed peak.

      "explanation": "The murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) increases with standing, as there is a \nreduction in preload. In conditions of reduced preload, there is lesser end diastolic volume in the \nleft ventricle, leading to a narrower outflow tract, and a louder murmur is heard. The murmur heard in HOCM is a mid-systolic murmur, which is loudest along the left sternal \nborder. It increases in conditions of decreased preload and afterload (standing, valsalva, vagal \nmaneuvers) or conditions of increased contractility (inotropic stimulation) and decreases when \npreload and afterload are increased (squatting, vasopressors). Most murmurs decrease in intensity with reduced preload and afterload except HOCM and mitral \nvalve prolapse (MVP).",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of transient loss of consciousness in this patient is suggestive of syncope. \nHence, an ECG must be done to rule out cardiac causes for syncope like - arrhythmias (atrial \nfibrillation, sinus node dysfunction, supra ventricular tachycardias) or a structural cardiac \nabnormality. A CT would only be required if a seizure or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is suspected. However, \nin this case - the episode only lasted for a few seconds, the patient has no history of similar \nepisodes in the past and there are no lasting neurological deficits after the episode. Therefore, \noption B is incorrect. Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness caused by global cerebral hypoperfusion. It can be \ndue to multiple causes, but is broadly divided into - neurally mediated syncope, orthostatic \nhypotension and cardiac syncope. The initial workup for a case of syncope includes: • Detailed history of the episode and past history of similar episodes • Physical examination mainly to check BP in standing and supine positions to • rule out orthostatic hypotension. • A resting ECG to look for cardiac arrhythmia • Option B: If the ECG is normal, no further tests are needed. If the ECG is suggestive of cardiac \narrhythmia, then further tests including continuous ECG monitoring and electrophysiological \nstudies may be done. Option C: Tilt-table testing is done in patients with recurrent syncopal attacks who are suspected \nto have vasovagal syncope. Psychiatric evaluation is done in patients with recurrent unexplained \nsyncopal attacks. Option D: Vestibular neuritis is associated with vertigo, where the patients typically complain of \ndizziness and a sense of spinning of the head. 802 \nSold by @itachibot ECG Basics",
