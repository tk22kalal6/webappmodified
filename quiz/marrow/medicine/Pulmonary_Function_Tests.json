      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Reduction in FEV1/FVC is characteristic of obstructive lung disease. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of expired air recorded when a person inhales to the \ntotal lung capacity and exhales as hard and as completely as possible. The volume of air expired in \nthe first second is called the forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1). Given below is a graphical representation of FEV and FEV1: FVC is reduced in both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. In obstructive diseases, the slope \nof FVC is steady, therefore the FEV1 value is low and the FEV1/FVC ratio decreases. In restrictive \ndiseases, the airflow is fast in the beginning leading to a higher value of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio \nincreases.",

      "explanation": "654 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario is suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is \ncharacterized by an increased residual volume. According to Uptodate, decreased vital capacity and increased total lung capacity is indicative of \nhyperinflation seen in COPD. FVC can be used a proxy for VC in normal individuals but in COPD \nFVC is less than VC due to air trapping, airflow limitation, and small airway collapse.",

DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air in the alveoli to the red \nblood cells in pulmonary capillaries. In general, the DLCO is used to identify the cause of dyspnea or hypoxemia.

After the starting point, the curve rapidly mounts to a peak: Peak \nexpiratory flow (PEF). Then, the PEF the curve descends (=the flow decreases) as more air is expired. A normal, \nnon-pathological F/V loop will descend in a straight or a convex line from the top (PEF) to the \nbottom (FVC). The forced inspiration that follows the forced expiration has roughly the same morphology, but \nthe PIF (Peak Inspiratory Flow) is not as distinct as PEF.",
