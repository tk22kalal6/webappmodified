      "explanation": "The minimum amount of ethanol that leads to an increased risk of developing alcoholic liver \ndisease is 28g/day. In women, the minimum is 14g/day. The risk factors for alcoholic liver disease are: • Quantity of alcohol consumption - The risk of developing alcoholic liver disease increases when \nalcohol consumption is &gt;14 drinks/ week in men and &gt;7drinks/week in women. A standard \ndrink contains 14g of ethanol which is present in - • 120 mL of wine • 350ml of beer • 45ml of spirits (gin, rum, whiskey, vodka, tequilla) • Gender - Women have increased susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease • Hepatitis C infection - Increases the severity and decreases survival in alcoholic liver disease • Genetics - A variation in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) \ngene confers an increased risk of progressive liver disease",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. It is usually characterized by an \nAST: ALT &gt; 2. This is because there is a deficiency of pyridoxal 5'- phosphate that is a cofactor \nfor the enzymatic activity of ALT. Therefore, ALT levels fail to rise and there is a reversal of the \nAST: ALT ratio. Prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged due to the deficiency of coagulation factors and, usually, does \nnot respond to the administration of parenteral vitamin K. Platelet counts are often reduced early \nin the disease, which is reflective of portal hypertension with hypersplenism. Elevated ALP levels are seen due to enzymatic induction by alcohol and mild cholestasis.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase) is the most specific marker of alcoholism among the given \noptions. The markers with &gt;60% sensitivity and specificity for heavy alcohol use are gamma-glutamyl \ntransferase (&gt;35 u) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), the combination of the two is \nlikely to be more accurate than one. An isolated elevation in serum GGT or GGT elevation out of \nproportion to that of other enzymes (such as the ALT and ALP) may be an indicator of alcohol \nabuse or alcoholic liver disease. ALT (option A) is usually elevated in acute hepatocellular conditions such as hepatitis. Alanine \naminotransferase is predominantly found in the liver, hence a more specific marker of liver injury. \nA ratio of AST/ALT &gt; 2:1 indicates the possibility of alcoholic liver disease and &gt; 3:1 ratio is \nhighly indicative of this condition. In alcoholic liver disease, ALT levels are often normal. ALP (option C) is elevated in cholestasis, ■■is also elevated when there is rapid bone growth like \nin children and adolescents because of bone alkaline phosphatase and in normal pregnancies due \nto placental alkaline phosphatase. LDH (option D) elevation is nonspecific.",

It can be expanded as below: • C - Have you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking? • A - Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? • G - Have you ever felt guilty or bad about your drinking? • E - Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a \nhangover (eye-opener)?

Severe alcoholic hepatitis is defined by a discriminant function  32.
