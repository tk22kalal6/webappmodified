      "explanation": "Bone pain is the most common symptom in multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy in which there is an increased proliferation of \nmonoclonal plasma cells. There is an increased production of monoclonal paraprotein (M \nprotein). Clinical features of multiple myeloma: • Bone pain (most common): • Due to proliferation of tumor cells, activation of osteoclasts that destroy bone, and suppression \nof osteoblasts that form new bone. • Persistent localized pain in a patient with myeloma usually signifies a pathological fracture. • Fever due to recurrent bacterial infections (second most common) • Acute kidney injury due to: • Hypercalcemia (most common) 1394 \nSold by @itachibot • Amyloid deposits • Hyperuricemia • Recurrent infections • Infiltration of the kidney by myeloma cells • Normocytic-normochromic anemia due to: • Replacement of normal marrow by expanding tumor cells • Inhibition of hematopoiesis by factors made by the tumor • Reduced production of erythropoietin by the kidney Myeloma defining events (MDE) include the presence of one or more features such as \nhypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia and lytic bone lesions.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "There is decreased anion gap in multiple myeloma due to the M protein. Anion gap in the serum is calculated as Na■ – (Cl– +HCO3–). The M protein is cationic, resulting in the retention of chloride causing decreased anion gap. Only 1% of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) go on to \ndevelop multiple myeloma. Hyperviscosity symptoms in multiple myeloma occurs due to \nexcessive production of M proteins, usually of IgG3 or IgA subtype. Waldenstrom \nmacroglobulinemia (IgM myeloma) is the most common cause for hyperviscosity syndrome due to \nexcess IgM paraprotein in these cases. Radioisotopic bone scanning is less useful in diagnosis because the bone lesions are lytic in nature \nand are rarely associated with osteoblastic new bone formation.",
