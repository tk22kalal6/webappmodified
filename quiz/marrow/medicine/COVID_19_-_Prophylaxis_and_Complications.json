Pernio / chilblains are skin lesions on the acral surfaces of the body characterised by the \ndevelopment of erythematous-violaceous or purpuric macules. They may be accompanied by \nedema and pruritus. It is usually due to cold exposure or underlying hematological disorders but has also been \nreported in patients with COVID-19 disease. The underlying mechanism is thought to be an \ninflammatory process. The lesions appear late (postviral phase) with the patients exhibiting \npositive IgM/ IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and negative RT-PCR. However, pernio like lesions \ncan also be seen in early stages of the disease when the patients are still infective. There are no treatment guidelines but high-potency topical corticosteroids may be helpful if the \nlesions are causing discomfort. Other cutaneous manifestations include exanthematous rash, \nlivedo reticularis, urticaria, MIS-C etc.",
