      "explanation": "Non-functioning pituitary adenomas most commonly arise from gonadotropic cells (80%). Pituitary adenomas are classified as functioning or non-functioning based on the secretion of \nhormones. Non-functioning adenomas are usually asymptomatic in the initial stages but as the \ntumor grows larger, mass effect produces clinical manifestations such as: 73 \nSold by @itachibot • Headache • Bitemporal hemianopia • Diplopia, ptosis • Compression of pituitary stalk • Hyperprolactinemia initially - reduced dopamine release leads to loss of inhibition of lactotrophs • Hypopituitarism in later stages",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pituitary adenomas &lt; 10 mm are called microadenomas. Asymptomatic pituitary tumors can be discovered incidentally on imaging. They must also be \nsuspected in patients with features of hormone hypersecretion or mass effect. In such cases, MRI \nwith contrast is the best investigation to detect the tumor, as shown below. Levels of pituitary hormones must also be measured to rule out both hypersecretion \nand hyposecretion.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Pituitary macroadenomas do not cause pigmentation of mucous membranes as ACTH levels are \nlow. In this condition, there is destruction of the pituitary gland by mass effect. This leads to \npanhypopituitarism or reduced levels of all hormones, including ACTH. Excessive pigmentation is \nonly seen in cases of excess ACTH. The following hormones are deficient in panhypopituitarism: 74 \nSold by @itachibot • ACTH - Secondary adrenal insufficiency • TSH - Secondary hypothyroidism • GH - Growth failure and adult hyposomatotropism • FSH, LH - Hypogonadic hypogonadism • Prolactin - Lactation failure Adiponectin, secreted by fat cells normally increases insulin sensitivity. It is usually suppressed by \ncortisol. In panhypopituitarism, decreased cortisol levels lead to increased insulin sensitivity.",

      "explanation": "Superior quadrantanopia may be seen in patients with prolactinoma &gt; 10 mm in size \n(macroadenoma). In this condition, visual field defects occur due to compression of the optic chiasm. In the initial \nstages, the pituitary tumor tends to compress the ventral portion of the optic chiasm. This causes \na bitemporal (heteronymous) superior field defect. As the tumor grows larger, the entire optic \nchiasm gets compressed, leading to complete bitemporal hemianopia, as shown below. Damage to the optic radiation in the temporal lobe would result in homonymous superior \nquadrantanopia or pie-in-the-sky appearance.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The diagnosis of a prolactinoma is highly likely when prolactin levels are &gt; 200 g/L. The normal range of serum prolactin (PRL) is 5-20 g/L. Prolactin levels &lt; 100 g/L can be due \nto non-functioning pituitary adenomas or non-neoplastic causes of hyperprolactinemia. MRI brain \nmust be done in all patients with hyperprolactinemia. Prolactinoma are tumors arising from the lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland, they can be \nclassified as microadenoma(&lt;1cm in diameter, usually non invasive ) or \nmacroadenoma(&gt;1cm, locally invasive to adjacent structures). Clinical features include \namenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea in women, impotence, loss of libido, infertility in men \nand if tumor extends beyond sella, there can be visual field defects and other mass effects. Treatment - In asymptomatic patients and those where fertility is not desired, they do not require \ntreatment and can be monitored using regular PRL measurements and MRI. In symptomatic \nmicroadenoma cases, oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine) form the main \ntreatment for hyperprolactinemia and reduction of tumor volume. For macroadenoma, before \nstarting dopamine agonists visual field testing is to be done, and reassess it with MRI changes \nevery 6-12 month intervals until maximum reduction is achieved, in unresponsive cases consider \nsurgery. 75 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes a woman presenting with hypopituitarism following \ntrans-sphenoidal resection. Mineralocorticoid supplementation is not needed postoperatively as it \nis regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and not by ACTH. Therefore, \nmineralocorticoid levels would remain intact despite ACTH deficiency. Thyroid hormone, estradiol, and glucocorticoid supplementation are needed in this patient as \ntheir secretion is regulated by anterior pituitary hormones. Features of hypopituitarism include growth abnormalities in children with a growth hormone \ndeficiency, insufficient levels of gonadotropins leading to menstrual irregularities, infertility in \nwomen and reduced sexual function, infertility and loss of secondary sexual characteristics in \nmen. TSH deficiency leads to stunted growth in children and features of hypothyroidism in both \nchildren and adults. ACTH deficiency leads to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Polyuria and polydipsia may be seen and indicate a loss of vasopressin secretion in posterior \npituitary lesions.

Surgery is not curative in the majority of patients as the tumor is adherent to \nsurrounding structures. They are benign epithelial cell-containing tumors and are of two types: • Adamantinomatous - calcifications and keratin nodules are seen • Papillary - calcifications are rare Biopsy reveals machinery or motor-oil-like fluid within the cyst that contains cholesterol \ncrystals. The treatment of choice is transcranial or transsphenoidal resection. It must be followed \nby postoperative radiation to prevent recurrence.",

      "explanation": "Shock is seen in pituitary apoplexy. Loss of consciousness (Option C) can also be seen but it occurs secondary to adrenal insufficiency \nand shock. Hence, shock is the most appropriate answer. Pituitary apoplexy refers to acute hemorrhagic infarction of the pituitary gland. This results in the \ncompression of surrounding structures and hypopituitarism leading to acute adrenal insufficiency. \nIt may be seen spontaneously in a pre-existing pituitary adenoma, post-partum (Sheehan’s \nsyndrome), or be associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus or sickle cell anemia or shock. Pituitary apoplexy is an endocrine emergency that can lead to severe hypoglycemia, hypotension, \nshock, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, and death. Acute clinical manifestations \ncommonly encompass intense headaches with signs of meningeal irritation, bilateral visual \nchanges, ophthalmoplegia, and even cardiovascular collapse. The investigation of choice is MRI. Patients who do not exhibit overt visual impairment or altered mental status can be managed \nconservatively with high-dose glucocorticoids.

The hormones are affected in the \norder of GH  Prolactin  LH and FSH  ACTH  TSH Sheehan syndrome refers to postpartum pituitary necrosis following severe postpartum \nhemorrhage (PPH). During pregnancy, the pituitary gland undergoes hypertrophy with increased \nblood supply. This makes it susceptible to ischemia and infarction when there is severe \nhypovolemia. The clinical presentation depends on the amount of damage to the pituitary. • Mild - can go unnoticed for many years • Moderate - develops over months • Lactation failure • Failure to resume menses • Mild fatigue and anorexia • Severe - endocrine emergency that develops within few days • Hypotension and shock • Severe hypoglycemia • Lactation failure GH deficiency is very common in Sheehan’s syndrome because somatotrophs are located in the \nlower and lateral regions of the pituitary gland, and are most likely to be damaged by ischemic \nnecrosis of the pituitary. 78 \nSold by @itachibot",
