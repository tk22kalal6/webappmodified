      "explanation": "The above ECG strip shows normal sinus rhythm. The features in this ECG that suggest this diagnosis are as follows: • The QRS complexes are narrow (&lt;120 ms or 3 small squares) which implies that the impulse is \nsupraventricular and is conducted via the normal conduction pathway. • Each QRS complex is preceded by a P wave. This means that all the atrial depolarizations that \narise in the sinus node are conducted to the ventricles. 840 \nSold by @itachibot • The PR interval is constant for all the impulses and is normal (&lt;200 ms) in duration. • The RR interval is constant which implies a regular rhythm. 841 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Premature ventricular beats are a type of ventricular tachycardias, not supraventricular \ntachycardias. Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate of &gt;100 beats/min. It can be classified based on the site of \norigin of the cardiac impulse as follows: • Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) originate above the ventricles, that is, in the sinoatrial \nnode, atria, or the atrioventricular node. Supraventricular tachycardias include: • Tachycardias originating from the atrium: • Sinus tachycardia- from the SA node • Focal atrial tachycardia • Multifocal atrial tachycardia • Atrial flutter • Atrial fibrillation • Tachycardias originating from the AV node: • Junctional tachycardia- automaticity within AV Node • AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) • Tachycardia associated with accessory atrioventricular pathways: atrioventricular reentry \ntachycardia (AVRT) • Ventricular tachycardias originate from the ectopic foci or the reentry pathways in the \nventricles. Ventricular tachycardias include: • Premature ventricular beats • Ventricular tachycardia (VT) 842 \nSold by @itachibot • Monomorphic VT- Very rapid monomorphic VT is also known as ventricular flutter • Polymorphic VT- associated with Torsades de pointes • Ventricular fibrillation",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above ECG shows increased heart rate with wide QRS complexes (&gt; 0.12s). This is \nsuggestive of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Types of ventricular tachycardia based on QRS morphology: • Monomorphic- a stable QRS morphology from beat to beat • Polymorphic- changing or multiform QRS variance from beat to beat. Torsades de pointes is an \nexample of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. • Bidirectional- has a beat-to-beat alternation in the QRS frontal plane axis. It is associated with \ndigitalis toxicity or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. The most common cause of VT is ischemic heart disease. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur due to impulses that originate within the ventricles. These \nimpulses are conducted through the normal ventricular myocardial cells instead of the fast \nconducting Purkinje system. Hence, they present with wide QRS complexes ( &gt;0.12 sec) on the \nECG. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occur due to impulses originating above the ventricles. These \nimpulses reach the ventricles through the proper fast conduction pathway resulting in a narrow \nQRS complex. SVTs are associated with wide QRS in few exceptional conditions like: • Conduction block in the left or right bundle branch • Activation of ventricles from an accessory pathway- antidromic AVRT The given ECG shows wide stable QRS complexes in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: 843 \nSold by @itachibot",

The most likely cause of slow regular heart rate in chronic \nAF is digitalis toxicity. Symptoms such as nausea, anorexia are also suggestive of digitalis toxicity. Digitalis lowers the AV nodal conduction by stimulating the vagal nerve endings leading to \nincreased vagal tone. Hence digitalis toxicity can cause AV nodal block. This leads to a junctional \nescape rhythm taking over the ventricles causing slow and regular heart rate. 847 \nSold by @itachibot Digitalis toxicity can also lead to a variety of arrhythmias as it increases the intracellular calcium \nlevels increasing the risk of tachyarrhythmias.",

      "explanation": "The most common reentrant tachycardia caused by an accessory pathway is orthodromic AV \nreentry. Accessory pathways (APs) are abnormal conduction pathways connecting the atrium and \nventricle. They can conduct impulses in the following ways: Antegrade conduction: • Occurs from the atria to the ventricle • The impulses from atria reach the ventricles faster via the accessory pathway as compared to the \nnormal AV nodal pathway as they bypass the AV nodal delay. • This leads to an earlier excitation of the ventricles known as the preexcitation of the ventricles \nand thus a wide QRS complex. • Examples- WPW syndrome and antidromic AVRT Retrograde conduction: • Occurs from the ventricle to the atria. • The impulses reach the ventricles via the normal AV nodal pathway but re-enter the atria \nthrough the accessory pathway. • Ventricular depolarization is normal, there is no preexcitation and thus a narrow \nQRS complex. It causes supraventricular tachycardia as the impulses re-enter the atria via the \naccessory pathway. • Examples- concealed accessory pathways (can cause SVTs) and orthodromic AVRT. AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is not caused by an accessory pathway. It involves tissues \nwith different conduction speeds within the AV node or just adjacent to the AV node, known as \nthe fast pathway and the slow pathway. This is known as dual AV nodal physiology. 855 \nSold by @itachibot",

Rate-slowing drugs such as non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, \ndiltiazem), beta-blockers, and digoxin are contraindicated in these patients.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Sick sinus syndrome is frequently seen in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation. Sick sinus syndrome (or sinus node dysfunction) is a group of abnormal heart rhythms. It is a \ndisorder of the sinoatrial node caused by impaired pacemaker function and impulse transmission. \nThis leads to a combination of abnormal rhythms, including atrial bradyarrhythmias, atrial \ntachyarrhythmias, and sometimes a pattern of alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, known as \ntachy-brady syndrome. These irregular rhythms can cause symptoms such as palpitations, \ndecreased tissue perfusion, subsequent fatigue, lightheadedness, pre-syncope, and syncope. The management of sick sinus syndrome includes identifying and correcting reversible factors, as \nan initial step. Some examples of reversible causes of Sinus Node Dysfunction include, • Hypothyroidism 858 \nSold by @itachibot • Sleep apnea • Anti-hypertensive medications eg. Beta-blockers • Anti-arrhythmic medications eg. Amiodarone, Procainamide Ambulatory ECG monitoring is required to diagnose as the symptoms are nonspecific. Treatment involves permanent pacing. Other options: Option A: The course of sinus node dysfunction is usually a slow progression over decades. In the \nearly stages, most patients are asymptomatic. Option B: It occurs most commonly in elderly patients due to the gradual loss of SA node \nfunction. Option D: Beta-blockers are contraindicated in this condition. 859 \nSold by @itachibot Ventricular Arrhythmias and Heart Blocks",
