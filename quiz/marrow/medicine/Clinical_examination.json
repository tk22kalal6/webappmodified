      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, the rectal temperature would be the best site to measure the core \nbody temperature. At extremes of high or low temperatures, like in Siachen, the axillary and the oral temperatures \nare highly misleading and should not be used to measure the core body temperature. The infrared tympanic thermometer measures the temperature of the eardrum which is \nrepresentative of the core body temperature. However, it often ends up measuring the \ntemperature of the ear canal. This is because of inadequate insertion into the ear canal due to \npoor manufacturing design or the presence of cerumen. Hence, it is not a reliable method of \nmeasuring the core body temperature.",

The \npatient is encouraged to swallow, allowing the tube to move down the esophagus with successive \nswallows until it reaches the measured distance. Subjective confirmation involves insufflating air through the proximal opening of the NG tube and \nlistening for the sound of air in the left upper quadrant where the stomach is located. Objective \nconfirmation can be obtained through pH measurement, chest or abdominal radiographs, \nultrasound, or calorimetric capnometry.

      "explanation": "The temperature of the water bath for a patient with frostbite should be maintained between 37- \n40°C (Option A). Circulating water is preferred for treatment. In frostbite, tissue damage results from severe environmental cold exposure or from direct contact \nwith a very cold object. Tissue injury results from both freezing and vasoconstriction. It usually \naffects the distal aspects of the extremities or exposed parts of the face, such as the ears, nose, \nchin, and cheeks. The treatment includes - extraction from cold environment, rapid rewarming, analgesics for pain \nduring thawing, antithrombotics or thrombolytics, cleaning of the injured area with soap or \nantiseptics, tetanus prophylaxis, monitoring for compartment syndrome and finally, elective late \namputation after imaging in severe cases. 26 \nSold by @itachibot Acid-Base Disorders",
