      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Sjogren's syndrome. In this condition, glomerular \nlesions are extremely rare. Defects of tubular function, including renal tubular acidosis, uricosuria, and phosphaturia, are \noften seen and are associated histologically with tubulointerstitial nephritis. Lacrimal and salivary glands are the major targets of this disease, while the respiratory and \ngastrointestinal tracts and the vagina may also be involved. The characteristic decrease in tears \nand saliva (sicca syndrome) is the result of lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis of the lacrimal and \nsalivary glands. The infiltrate contains predominantly activated CD4+ helper T cells and some B \ncells, including plasma cells. Antibodies detected are: • Rheumatoid factor - seen in 75% of patients, whether or not coexisting rheumatoid arthritis is \npresent • Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) • SS-A (Ro) - associated with early disease onset, longer disease duration, and extra-glandular \nmanifestations, such as cutaneous vasculitis and nephritis • SS-B (La) These patients are at high risk for the development of B-cell lymphomas. About 60% of patients \nhave another accompanying autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and these \npatients also have the symptoms and signs of that disorder. Biopsy of the lip (to examine minor salivary glands) is essential for the diagnosis of Sjögren's \nsyndrome. The image shows an enlargement of the salivary gland with intense lymphocytic and plasma cell \ninfiltration with ductal epithelial hyperplasia in the salivary gland. 492 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Mikulicz syndrome is characterized by lacrimal and salivary gland enlargement from any \ncause, including sarcoidosis, lymphomas, and other tumors.",

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodes of reversible vasoconstriction in the fingers \nand toes on exposure to cold. Rarely, it affects the lips, tip of the nose, and earlobes. These \nepisodes classically occur in the following sequence: • Affected part turning pale due to vasoconstriction. • Blue due to ischemia, often associated with numbness or pain. • As blood flow returns, the area turns red with a burning sensation. 493 \nSold by @itachibot",

Systemic sclerosis is characterized by progressive fibrosis involving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, \nand other tissues. Fibrosis may be the result of the activation of fibroblasts by cytokines produced \nby T cells. 494 \nSold by @itachibot Focal, and sometimes diffuse, subcutaneous calcifications may develop, especially in patients with \nCREST syndrome.
