      "explanation": "The average lifespan of platelets in circulation is 7–10 days. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the regulator of platelet production. A reduction in platelet and \nmegakaryocyte mass increases the level of TPO, which then stimulates platelet production. The shelf life of donor platelets is 5 days. It is stored on a special agitator at 20-24 °C. The half-life \nof transfused platelets is 3-5 days.",

The relapse usually occurs once they are \ntapered. Vaccination against encapsulated organisms (pneumococcus, meningococcus, H. \ninfluenzae) is advised before splenectomy is performed. It is important to note that in some patients ITP resolves by itself, and observation along with \nintermittent IV immunoglobulins and anti - Rh(D) administration or administration of a 1356 \nSold by @itachibot thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eltrombopag, romiplostim) can be a viable option before \nsplenectomy is considered. The treatment of ITP is as follows: ITP is an acquired disorder characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of platelets and \npossibly inhibition of platelet release from the megakaryocyte. Secondary causes of ITP include \nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV-AIDS, and Hepatitis C.

      "explanation": "Thrombocytopenia is not seen in Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. 1361 \nSold by @itachibot Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia is a primary defect of platelet function (aggregation). It occurs due \nto congenital absence of the GpIIb/IIIa receptor. It presents as superficial mucocutaneous \nbleeding with normal platelet count and single isolated platelets without clumping on peripheral \nsmear. The levels of vWF are normal. Normally, release of ADP causes platelets to change shape and bind to fibrinogen through the \nGpIIb/IIIa receptor. In Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, absence of the receptor causes abnormal \naggregation (absent or reduced) on adding ADP. However, aggregation in response to ristocetin is \nnormal, as it is dependent on GpIb and vWF. Secondary platelet dysfunction can be seen in the following conditions: • Uremia • Paraproteinemia • Myeloproliferative disorders",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most common side effect of aspirin is gastrointestinal symptoms. The use of enteric-coated \naspirin does not reduce these side effects. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates and inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, which causes reduced \nsynthesis of thromboxane A2. At high doses, it also inhibits COX-2, which results in the \nanti-inflammatory effects of aspirin. The major GI side effects include dyspepsia, erosive gastritis, peptic ulcers with bleeding and \nperforation. The overall risk of major bleeding with aspirin is 1–3% per year, which increases 2-3 \nfold if there is concurrent use of other antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants. The risk of bleeding \ncan be reduced by eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and giving proton pump inhibitors \n(PPIs). Aspirin sensitivity refers to bronchospasm or urticaria/angioedema seen immediately after \nadministration of aspirin. It is also called Samter's triad (asthma, recurrent nasal polyps, aspirin \nsensitivity).
