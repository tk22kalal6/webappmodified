In contrast, when the mother is HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative \nor HBsAg positive with Anti Hbe, the risk of vertical transmission is low.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of jaundice. The tests that should be done in this patient \nto rule out acute viral hepatitis include: • Anti-HAV • HBsAg • IgM anti-HBc • Anti-HCV We mainly test for hepatitis A, B, and C. Tests for hepatitis D and E are not used routinely. Hepatitis D only occurs concurrently with Hepatitis B, either as a co-infection (when it is clinically \nindistinguishable from HBV infection) or superimposed on chronic HBV infection. In the latter \nscenario, it presents as a sudden worsening of the patient’s condition. IgM anti-HDV, IgG \nanti-HDV, and HDV RNA assays are useful for diagnosis when hepatitis D is suspected. Hepatitis E is not tested as the majority of patients who acquire hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection \nspontaneously clear the virus. Acute hepatic failure is more likely in those who are pregnant and \nin those who are malnourished or have preexisting liver disease. Chronic HEV has been described \nalmost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts (e.g., organ transplantation). The diagnosis of \nacute HEV is typically based upon the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV. Both false positives \nand negatives are common with available assays and are thus, not very reliable. Thus, additional \nserologic testing or HEV RNA testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and not be \nuseful as a screening test.
