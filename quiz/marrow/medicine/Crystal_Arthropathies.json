      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In gout, the crystals are negatively birefringent on polarized light microscopy of the joint aspirate. Gout is a metabolic disease that is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals \nin joints and connective tissue. It is more common in males. It usually presents as monoarthritis that may be acute and episodic or chronic. Acute gout \npresents with a joint that is red, hot, swollen, and extremely tender on examination. The \nmetatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe is the most frequently involved joint. Synovial fluid analysis of joint aspirate is diagnostic and shows the following features: • Increased leukocyte count with a neutrophilic predominance • Negatively birefringent crystals on polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid Antitubercular drugs like pyrazinamide and ethambutol cause hyperuricemia by inhibiting uric \nacid excretion in the kidney.

      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation and polarised microscopy showing negatively birefringent \nneedle-shaped crystals point towards a diagnosis of gout. In gout, the negatively birefringent \nneedle-shaped crystals are due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Monosodium urate crystals in gout: Option A: Calcium apatite crystals can accumulate in areas of tissue damage, hypercalcemia, or \nhyperparathyroid states. Option C: Calcium pyrophosphate crystals are positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals \nthat are seen in pseudogout. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals seen in pseudogout: 478 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Ammonium urate crystals can cause urinary bladder stones which are radiolucent but \nmay develop a calcific coating making it visible on X-rays.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given scenario of multiple painful swelling of ankles and toes that responded to NSAIDs is \nsuggestive of gout. High-dose salicylates (&gt;3g/day) do not precipitate gout. Although high-dose salicylates inhibit both the secretion and reabsorption of urate, the inhibition \nof reabsorption is more than the inhibition of secretion, and therefore the net effect is uricosuric. On the other hand, low-dose salicylates (&lt;2 to 3g/day) are associated with uric acid retention. \nThey inhibit renal tubular secretion of uric acid resulting in hyperuricemia and may precipitate \ngout. Aspirin is not used to treat acute attacks of gout due to its uric acid retention property. However, \nlow-dose aspirin used for cardiovascular prophylaxis need not be discontinued during the \ntreatment of a gout flare. 479 \nSold by @itachibot",

Urate-lowering drugs such as allopurinol, probenecid, and lesinurad are not initiated during acute \nattacks. The treatment options for an acute attack of gout include: • NSAIDs: Indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are highly effective • Colchicine: It acts by inhibiting neutrophil migration and reduces inflammation. It is used orally \nand is most effective if given early in an attack. • Glucocorticoids: Systemic glucocorticoids may be used in polyarticular involvement. If the \ndisease is limited to one joint, intraarticular triamcinolone may be given.",
