      "explanation": "The cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI are affected by cavernous sinus syndrome. The cavernous sinus syndrome is a condition caused by any pathology involving the cavernous \nsinus. The oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and trigeminal (V) nerves pass in relation to the lateral \nwall of the cavernous sinus. The abducent (VI) nerve passes through the cavernous sinus. Patients with this condition usually present with the following features: • Orbital or facial pain • Orbital swelling and chemosis due to occlusion of the ophthalmic veins • Fever • Oculomotor neuropathy (III, IV, and VI) • Trigeminal neuropathy (V) Causes of cavernous sinus syndrome include: • Cavernous sinus thrombosis - most common • Carotid artery aneurysm • Carotid-cavernous fistula • Tumors such as meningioma. 1256 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Tic douloureux is another term for trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by frequent paroxysms of severe pain in the lips, gums, \ncheek, or chin. It is sometimes seen in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the \ntrigeminal nerve. Middle-aged and elderly females are primarily affected. The pain usually lasts for a short time \n(seconds to minutes) but be may intense enough that the patient winces, hence the term 'tic'. A characteristic feature is the presence of trigger zones, typically on the face, lips, or tongue. \nPatients usually report excruciating pain during activities such as washing the face or brushing the \nteeth. However, no signs of sensory loss can be demonstrated.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The high frequency of trigeminal neuralgia in patients with multiple sclerosis occurs due to the \ninvolvement of oligodendrocyte-derived myelin covering the beginning of the nerve. Multiple sclerosis is a disorder of oligodendrocyte myelin. It should be ruled out when trigeminal \nneuralgia is bilateral or develops in a young adult. In such cases, the cause is a demyelinating \nplaque near the root entry zone of the fifth cranial nerve in the pons. In these patients, a facial \nsensory loss is also often found in association.",

This causes lancinating pain in the distribution of the nerve which is known \nas trigeminal neuralgia. Though trigeminal neuralgia can be diagnosed by the clinical features, MRI is recommended to \ndefine the underlying cause.

      "explanation": "Maximal weakness occurs within 48 hours as a rule in Bells' palsy. Bell's palsy is an idiopathic, peripheral facial paralysis or paresis of acute onset due to a lower \nmotor neuron (LMN) lesion of the facial nerve. Clinical presentation of Bell’s palsy: • Pain behind the ear (may precede paralysis and last for 1-2 days) • Bell's phenomenon • Asymmetrical face • Hyperacusis (due to stapedial paralysis) • Loss of taste (involvement of chorda tympani). MRI may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve. Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Bell’s phenomenon refers to a normal phenomenon that becomes evident in facial paralysis. The \neyeballs roll up and outwards on attempting to close the eyes. It is also known as the palpebral oculogyric reflex. It is a normal protective reflex resulting in the \nelevation of globes while blinking to protect the eyes from injury. It also serves to provide a wiper \nblade-like cleansing function of the cornea by the eyelid. However, it occurs behind the closed eyelids in healthy individuals. It becomes noticeable in Bell's \npalsy as the eyelids fail to close completely. The image below shows a patient with evident Bell’s phenomenon.",

      "explanation": "Acyclovir may be considered as add-on therapy for patients with severe Bell's palsy as 400mg five \ntimes daily for 10 days. Monotherapy is not recommended. Treatment of Bell's palsy involves prednisone 60-80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then \ntapered over the next 5 days. Randomized trials found no added benefit of the antiviral agents \nvalacyclovir and acyclovir when compared to glucocorticoids alone. The use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep prevents corneal drying.
