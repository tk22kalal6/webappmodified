The high-risk population is individuals whose age is 60 years and who have a smoking history of \n10 pack-years. Low dose CT scans are shown to detect more lung nodules and cancers than the standard CXR in \nselected high-risk populations. Also, up to 85% of cancers thus detected are classified as stage I. \nEarly staged cancers are considered potentially curable with surgical resection. Here, the aim is to reduce medical radiation exposure as much as possible, low dose CT is \neffective in screening for lung cancer, and is thus preferred.",
