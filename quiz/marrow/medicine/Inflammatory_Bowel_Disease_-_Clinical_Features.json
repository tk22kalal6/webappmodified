      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The gene associated with Crohn's disease is the NOD2 gene. Št is present on chromosome 16. Nucleotide-binding oligomeri˜ation domain 2 (NOD2) acts as a cytoplasmic sensor of microbial \nproducts. Defective NOD2 gene results in defective innate immunity. When the innate immunity \nis unable to clear the bacteria, there is an exaggerated response of the immune system (T-cells) \nresulting in damage to the host tissue. Option B: JAK2 mutation is associated with polycythemia vera. Option C: BRAF V600E mutation is associated with melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer, and \nserous ovarian cancers. Option D: STAT‚ mutations are associated with the autosomal dominant hyper-ŠgE syndrome.",

Mesenteric fat is normally seen along the longitudinal axis of the intestine. However, in Crohn's \ndisease, excessive fibrofatty proliferation results in mesenteric fat wrapping around the inflamed \nbowel. This is called creeping fat. Strictures and fistulae are the commonly associated complications of long-standing Crohn's \ndisease. Strictures can cause bowel obstruction. Other gross features seen in Crohn's disease are: • Transmural inflammation- full-thickness inflammation involving all the layers of the bowel • Aphthous ulcers- small, shallow ulcers surrounded by erythema • Longitudinal ulcers- linear or serpiginous deep ulcers • Skip lesions- involvement of discontinuous segments of the bowel with intervening normal \nmucosa • Cobblestone appearance- deep, longitudinal ulcerations interlaced with intervening normal \nmucosa The image below shows cobblestone appearance in Crohn's disease. 392 \nSold by @itachibot",

The fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are elevated in inflammatory conditions like inflammatory \nbowel disease, but not in irritable bowel syndrome. The stool guaiac test or guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) reveals the presence of microscopic \nlevels of blood suggesting Crohn's disease.
