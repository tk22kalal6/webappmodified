His HLA identical 50-year-old brother who is blood type O positive would be the best \nchoice. Other options: Option A: An identical twin brother would not be the donor of choice. The therapeutic benefit of \nstem cell transplant in hematological malignancies is due to the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL). \nDonor T lymphocytes attack malignant hematopoietic stem cells of the recipient that remain after \nhigh-dose chemotherapy. Despite having a low rate of graft versus host disease (GvHD), stem cells \nfrom an identical twin do not have a desirable degree of GvL effect, leading to higher rates of \nrecurrence post-transplant. Option B: Autologous (umbilical cord transplant) is not recommended as higher rates of relapse \nhave been reported. Option D: An HLA identical sibling is preferred over an unrelated HLA identical donor because \nthere is a greater chance of matching for minor histocompatibility complex (mHC). This reduces \nthe risk of GvHD. ABO compatibility is also important to consider, but a minor ABO mismatch \n(Rh mismatch) doesn't have any impact on hemolysis, graft-versus-host disease, or survival. 1383 \nSold by @itachibot",
