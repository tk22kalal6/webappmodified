      "explanation": "Hyperglycemia is not a characteristic of GH deficiency. Isolated GH deficiency, especially in \nchildren, can lead to a higher propensity to develop hypoglycemia. This is attributed to the \nrelatively unopposed action of insulin. Isolated GH deficiency in children is associated with the following features: • Short stature • Micropenis • Increased fat • High-pitched voice • High propensity to develop hypoglycemia due to relatively unopposed insulin action. 62 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Impaired glucose tolerance, galactorrhea, and hypertension can be seen in patients with \nacromegaly. GH secretion is a part of the counter-regulatory defense mechanism against hypoglycemia. \nPhysiological GH secretion is inhibited by hyperglycemia. In acromegaly or gigantism, GH \nsecretion is autonomous and not suppressed by glucose. Thus, its diagnosis can be confirmed by \ndemonstrating the failure of GH suppression with an oral glucose load (impaired oral glucose \ntolerance test). Galactorrhea is due to hyperprolactinemia and hypertension is secondary to increased aldosterone \nlevels in acromegaly. GH leads to increased production of vitamin D3 which results in increased \nphosphate absorption from the intestine and decreased renal excretion. Hence there is increased \nserum phosphate level.",

        "d": "Random growth hormone levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The best screening test for acromegaly is the measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 \n(IGF-1) level. Other options: Options A and B: Oral glucose challenge test with growth hormone (GH) levels is used for further \nconfirmation of the diagnosis. Increased insulin-like growth factor-1 binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) \nlevels can also be seen in patients with acromegaly. But they are not typically used as initial \nscreening methods. Option D: IGF-1 levels are more reliable than random GH levels because GH secretion is pulsatile. \nIGF-1 levels reflect long-term exposure to GH and provide a more stable indicator of excessive GH \nproduction. Acromegaly is characterized by excessive GH secretion, usually caused by a somatotrope adenoma \nin the pituitary gland. It can also be due to ectopic GH secretion or hypothalamic tumors. The clinical presentation of acromegaly includes frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, \ncoarse facial features, mandibular prognathism, widened space between lower incisors and other \nmanifestations such as soft tissue swelling, deepening voice, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthropathy, \nand acanthosis nigricans. 66 \nSold by @itachibot It can also lead to cardiovascular complications (cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, \nand hypertension), obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, an increased risk of colon polyps, \nand colonic malignancy. The primary treatment for acromegaly is surgical resection of GH-secreting adenomas. \nSomatostatin receptor ligands like octreotide and lanreotide, which suppress GH and IGF-1 levels, \nare used as adjuvant treatment or when surgery is not possible or unsuccessful. Radiation therapy \nmay be considered for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to medical therapy. Other \ntreatment options include GH receptor antagonists like pegvisomant and dopamine agonists like \ncabergoline.",
