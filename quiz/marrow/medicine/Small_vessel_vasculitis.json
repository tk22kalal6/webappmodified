The radiograph below shows cavitating nodules in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(Wegener's granulomatosis). Renal involvement initially appears as focal or segmental glomerulonephritis on biopsy. If left \nuntreated, it can lead to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Patients with Wegener's \ngranulomatosis have an increased incidence of venous thrombosis, like deep vein thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism.

It is a necrotizing vasculitis of the small-to-medium-sized vessels and in order to be diagnosed \nwith Churg-Strauss, a patient should have evidence of asthma, peripheral blood and tissue \neosinophilia (&gt;1000 cells/L), extravascular granuloma formation and clinical features \nconsistent with vasculitis. Common presenting symptoms of this condition are lower respiratory tract symptoms such as \nsevere attacks of asthma, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and \nnasal polyps, mono neuritis multiplex (a type of peripheral neuropathy affecting at least two \nnerves) which presents with a complaint of pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected areas and \nskin lesions like palpable purpura and subcutaneous nodules. Renal involvement is less common and less severe than other small vessel vasculitis. P-ANCA antibodies are present in Churg Strauss syndrome. • Severe attacks of asthma • Mononeuritis multiplex: a type of peripheral neuropathy affecting at least two nerves. Patients \nwill complain of pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected areas. • Skin lesions like palpable purpura and subcutaneous nodules. Glucocorticoids show effective responses in these patients. Other drugs that have been tried are \nmepolizumab and rituximab. For fulminant multisystem disease, daily cyclophosphamide with prednisolone followed by \nazathioprine or methotrexate is used. Option A: Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis presents with palpable purpura, arthralgia, neuropathy, \nand glomerulonephritis. It is most commonly associated with Hepatitis C. Option B: Polyarteritis nodosa can also present with mononeuritis multiplex and skin lesions, but \nthey do not have eosinophilia, it has predominant neutrophilia.
