      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The nasal swab is placed in the same viral transport media tube as the throat swab. Samples that can be used for COVID-19 testing are: • Throat and nasal swab • Oropharyngeal swab • Nasopharyngeal swab • Broncho-alveolar lavage • Endotracheal aspirate Combined throat and nasal swabs: • Tilt patient's head back 70 degrees. • Gently rotate the swab and insert less than one inch into the nostril. Rotate the swab several \ntimes against the nasal wall and repeat the same in the other nostril with the same swab. • Place the tip of the swab into the transport media tube and cut off the applicator. • For throat swab, take a second swab, insert into the mouth and swab the posterior pharynx and \ntonsillar areas. • Place the tip of the swab into the same tube and cut off the applicator tip. Oropharyngeal swab: • Tilt patient's head back 70 degrees. • Rub swab over both tonsillar pillars and posterior oropharynx and avoid touching the tongue, \nteeth, and gums. • Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Avoid calcium alginate swabs and swabs with \nwooden shafts. • Place the swab immediately into sterile tubes with viral transport medium. Nasopharyngeal swab: • Tilt the patient's head back 70 degrees • Insert flexible swab through the nares parallel to the palate (not upwards) until resistance is \nencountered 1526 \nSold by @itachibot • Rub and roll the swab and leave it in place for several seconds to absorb secretions before \nremoving • Place the swab immediately into sterile tubes with viral transport medium.

      "question": "Question 5: An elderly patient was rushed to the casualty following bouts of severe breathlessness. He \nreported a history of fever and cough for the past 3 days. On examination, his SpO2 was 85% \nand RR was 32/min. CT scan is shown below. What is the gold standard investigation for his \ndiagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "a": "CLIA",

        "c": "RAT",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario, along with CT showing bilateral multiple patchy consolidation and \ngrid-like thickness of interlobular septa, is suggestive of COVID-19. The gold standard for its \ndiagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets in the respiratory tract materials by reverse \ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the first week of symptoms. RT-PCR involves the reverse transcription of the genetic material of the virus (RNA) to \ncomplementary DNA (cDNA), followed by amplification of some regions of the cDNA. Four \nregions of the SARS CoV2 genome are used as targets: • RdRp gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) • Genes from structural proteins • E (virus envelope) • N (virus nucleocapsid), • ORF1ab gene (open reading frame 1a and 1b) CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) uses small, chip-based, portable, \nbattery-operated devices that detect target genetic material of SARS CoV2. Examples include \nTrueNat and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 Options A and B: Antibody testing- Antibodies of IgA, IgM, and IgG isotypes specific to different \nvirus proteins are detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or \nchemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA). CLIA is more sensitive compared to ELISA. Option C: Rapid antigen test (RAT)- Antigen-based assays are used as point-of-care tests for early \ndetection of SARS-CoV-2. They are used at the field level for early detection of infection and quick \ncontainment. Most of such tests have relatively moderate sensitivity but high specificity. They are \nused for diagnosis along with RT-PCR.",

FELUDA is an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay. The name is \ninspired by a fictitious detective character in novels written by Satyajit Ray. FELUDA uses CRISPR-Cas9 technology (CRISPR = Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short \nPalindromic Repeats). The CRISPR technology uses a highly specific CAS9 protein to find and \nbind to the target Covid signature. This is then coupled with paper-strip chemistry to elicit a visual \nreadout on a paper strip. It is a very affordable, sensitive (96%), and specific (98%) strip test \nwhich can detect viral genetic material within 45 minutes.",
