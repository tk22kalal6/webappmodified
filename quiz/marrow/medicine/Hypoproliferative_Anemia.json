      "explanation": "Hemolytic anemia is not a hypoproliferative anemia. Anemia can be defined as hemoglobin of &lt; 13 g/dl in men and &lt; 12 g/dl in women. Based on \nthe mechanism of reduction of hemoglobin, anemia can be classified as: • Hypoproliferative anemias - due to impaired production of RBCs • Hemolytic anemias and hemoglobinopathies - due to increased destruction of RBCs • Anemia due to blood loss Hypoproliferative anemias are characterized by an abnormally low reticulocyte \nresponse (reticulocyte index &lt;2–2.5) to reduced RBC production. They include: • Iron-deficiency anemia • Anemia of chronic disease (inflammation, renal disease, or malignancies) • Thalassemia • Sideroblastic anemia • Aplastic anemia • Megaloblastic macrocytic anemias (folate and vitamin B12 deficiency) • Non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemias (alcohol use)",

      "question": "Question 2: A 25-year-old woman came to the OPD one year after the birth of her last child. She had been \ntreated for iron deficiency anemia while pregnant. On examination, she is pale and \ninvestigations show a Hb of 5g/dl and a reticulocyte count of 9%. What is her corrected \nreticulocyte count? (Take normal Hb as 15g/dl)",

        "a": "6",

        "c": "3",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The corrected reticulocyte count (CRC) of this patient is 3. CRC = Reticulocyte % x (Actual Hb / Normal Hb) Plugging in the values given in the question, CRC = 9% x 5/15 = 3% Alternatively, CRC can be calculated using hematocrit (PCV) as follows: CRC = Reticulocyte % x (Actual PCV / Normal PCV) For these calculations, take normal Hb as 15g/dL and normal PCV as 45%. The patient's hemoglobin level (5 g/dL) is significantly lower than the normal hemoglobin level (15 \ng/dL). To obtain an accurate assessment of reticulocyte production relative to the reduced number \nof circulating red blood cells, a correction factor has to be applied. CRC accounts for the anemia \nand provides a more precise estimate of the reticulocyte count. When polychromatophilic macrocytes (prematurely released reticulocytes/shift cells) are observed \nin the peripheral blood smear, a second correction is applied to account for the longer life of \nreticulocytes to yield reticulocyte production index (RPI). 1285 \nSold by @itachibot In the classification of anemia, the patient's reticulocyte count is compared to the expected \nreticulocyte response. Reticulocytes can be identified by staining their ribosomal RNA with a \nsupravital dye, resulting in the formation of blue or black punctate spots. They can be quantified \nmanually or by using fluorescent dyes. The presence of reticulocytes indicates active red cell \nproduction. The premature release of reticulocytes is typically associated with increased EPO stimulation. In \nhemolytic anemia, red cell production can increase six to seven times. If the RPI &lt; 2 in a patient \nwith anemia, a defect in erythroid marrow proliferation or maturation has to be suspected.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures the range of red blood cell volumes and provides an \nassessment of their variability (anisocytosis). The normal range of RDW is 11-14%. In the presence of uneven cell size (anisocytosis), the RDW \nincreases to 15-18%. RDW has clinical utility in two main scenarios: • In cases of microcytic anemia (low MCV), it helps differentiate between iron deficiency and \nthalassemia. Thalassemia is characterized by uniformly small red blood cells with a normal RDW, \nwhile iron deficiency leads to greater size variability and an increased RDW. • A high RDW can indicate dimorphic anemia caused by chronic atrophic gastritis. Vitamin B12 \nmalabsorption results in macrocytic anemia and blood loss leads to iron deficiency (microcytic \nanemia).",

Hence, the surface area of iron absorption is not \naffected. Dietary iron is efficiently absorbed in its heme form. Non-heme iron is less efficiently absorbed \nmainly because of interference by phosphates, tannins, oxalates, and other food constituents. \nAcidic pH enhances iron absorption by promoting the conversion of ferric to ferrous iron by the \nenzyme ferrireductase. 1288 \nSold by @itachibot The following are malabsorptive procedures that reduce the duodenal surface area and hence, \nreduce iron absorption: • Biliopancreatic diversion • Roux-en-Y gastric bypass • Duodenal switch",
