Option B: Dejerine Roussy syndrome, also known as thalamic pain syndrome usually occurs after \na stroke. The patient experiences burning pain over affected areas of the body.

Current WHO guidelines recommend routine substitution of pyridoxine to patients who are at \nrisk of peripheral neuropathy, e.g., malnutrition, chronic alcohol dependence, diabetics, HIV. However, pyridoxine excess (acute intoxication or long-term use of large doses) is also found to \ncause peripheral neuropathy. 1140 \nSold by @itachibot",

Plexiform neurofibroma represents an uncommon variant (30%) of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). \nPlexiform neurofibromas are usually evident at birth and result from a diffuse thickening of nerve \ntrunks and surrounding tissues that are usually located in the orbital or temporal region of the \nface. The skin overlying it may be coarse and associated with hyperpigmentation. Plexiform neurofibromas may produce an overgrowth of an extremity and a deformity of the \ncorresponding bone. NF1 is clinically diagnosed when any 2 of the following 7 features are present: • Six or more café-au-lait macules &gt;5mm in prepubertal and &gt;15mm in postpubertal • Axillary or inguinal freckling • Two or more iris lisch nodules • Two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma • A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or cortical thinning of long bones with or \nwithout pseudoarthrosis. • Optic gliomas • A first-degree relative with NF-1 1141 \nSold by @itachibot Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Other Immune-mediated Neuropathies",
