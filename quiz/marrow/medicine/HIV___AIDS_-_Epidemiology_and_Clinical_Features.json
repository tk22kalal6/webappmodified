      "explanation": "The time interval between primary HIV infection and the manifestation of AIDS is 10 years. After exposure to the HIV virus, there occurs primary infection following an incubation period of \n2-4 weeks, which is usually symptomatic in more than 50% of cases, following 3-6 weeks there is \nacute HIV syndrome due to wide dissemination of the virus, characterized by fever, sore throat, \ndiarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and rash. This peak viremia drops as the immune response develops, to reach a plateau about 3 months \nlater. Following this there is a prolonged period of clinical latency, during which infected \nindividuals are asymptomatic, lasting for a median of 10 years. 1483 \nSold by @itachibot Following this period, chronic persistent infection develops which is the hallmark of HIV disease \ncalled Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Long-term non-progressors: a small part of untreated HIV-infected people with CD4 counts \nwithin the reference range for &gt;10 years. Elite controllers: Some long-term non-progressors have undetectable viral loads.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most common form of heart disease associated with HIV infection is coronary heart disease. In patients with HIV infection, cardiovascular disease may be a direct consequence of HIV \ninfection, a complication of anti-retroviral therapy or due to classical risk factors like smoking. Exposure to HIV protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been associated \nwith an increase in total cholesterol and/or risk of MI (Myocardial infarction). Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) is referred to as \nHIV-associated cardiomyopathy. This generally occurs as a late complication of HIV infection and, \nhistologically, displays elements of myocarditis. 1492 \nSold by @itachibot HIV / AIDS - Management and Prophylaxis",
