      "explanation": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is not seen in mitral stenosis. On the contrary, right ventricle \nhypertrophy is seen. 896 \nSold by @itachibot Mechanism of mitral stenosis (MS): In a normal mitral valve, there is no obstruction to the flow of blood from the left atrium(LA) to \nthe left ventricle. Therefore a small LA pressure is sufficient to empty the blood into the ventricle. When the MVA is &lt;~2 sq cm, blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle, propelled by \na mildly elevated atrial pressure. Hence, patients are usually asymptomatic and may develop \ndyspnea only when the heart rate increases, as seen in exertion, excitement, fever, etc. All these \nconditions: • Increase the rate of blood flow across the mitral orifice, resulting in further elevation of the LA \npressure • Decrease the diastolic filling time, resulting in a reduction in cardiac output The image below explains the mechanism of mitral stenosis.",

      "explanation": "Carvallo’s sign refers to the increase in the intensity of systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation \nwith inspiration. During inspiration, the venous return to the heart increases due to the negative intrathoracic \npressure. This increases the leak from the right ventricle to the right atrium making the murmur \nlouder. In general, the right-sided heart murmurs increase in intensity with inspiration and decrease in \nintensity with expiration, while the opposite is true for left-sided heart murmurs.

It may be caused due to the calcification of the \nnormal aortic valve, calcification of congenital bicuspid valve, and rheumatic heart disease. Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis are: • Exertional dyspnea - this occurs due to the left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised \nend-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to \nelevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. • Angina pectoris - it occurs due to the combination of the increased O2 needs of hypertrophied \nmyocardium and reduction of O2 delivery. • Syncope - it occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial \ndilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.",

Auscultation findings in aortic stenosis: • Early systolic ejection sound - heard in early stages, disappears when the valve becomes calcified \nand rigid • Paradoxical splitting of S2 - With worsening of stenosis, delayed closure of the aortic valve \noccurs. This leads to narrowing of S2 sound, and in severe cases, leads to paradoxical splitting of \nS2. • S4 and S3 - heard in severe cases • Ejection systolic murmur - starts after S1, increases in intensity to reach the peak, and ends \nbefore A2.

      "explanation": "A significant difference in blood pressure measured between two arms (&gt;10 mm Hg) may be \nseen in Takayasu arteritis (subclavian artery disease), supravalvular aortic stenosis, aortic \ncoarctation, and aortic dissection (all four options). An early diastolic murmur in the right second intercostal space (aortic area) is suggestive of aortic \nregurgitation. Supravalvular aortic stenosis (Option A), which involves the part of the aorta distal \nto the aortic valve, is unlikely to cause aortic regurgitation and hence the best answer. 905 \nSold by @itachibot Features \nSupravalvula \nr AS Takayasu arteritis \nAortic dissection \nCoarctation of ao \nrta Aortic regurgitation \nUnlikely \nPresent in 25% of ca \nses Present Present in acute situatio \nns BP difference between \narms Present \nPresent \nPresent \nMay be present So the single best answer would be Supravalvular AS &gt; Coarctation of the aorta.",
