It indicates the involvement of the cord adjacent to T7-T8 vertebral 1161 \nSold by @itachibot bodies. The spinal cord has 31 segments, but they do not always correspond to the same vertebral body. The first seven pairs of cervical spinal nerves exit above the same-numbered vertebral bodies. All \nthe subsequent nerves exit below the same-numbered vertebral bodies. This is because of the \npresence of eight cervical spinal cord segments but only seven cervical vertebrae. The lower spinal nerves take an increasingly downward course to exit via intervertebral foramina.",

This condition affects the cervical cord producing arm weakness &gt; leg weakness. A dissociated \nsensory loss i.e. loss of pain and temperature with preservation of light touch, joint position, and \nvibration sensations is seen over the shoulders, lower neck, and upper trunk (cape distribution). It results from selective damage to the gray matter nerve cells and the decussating spinothalamic \ntracts surrounding the central canal. These decussating fibers carry crude touch, pain, and \ntemperature sensations. Spinal trauma, syringomyelia, and intrinsic cord tumors are the main causes. 1165 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: In Brown–Sequard Syndrome, ipsilateral weakness and loss of joint position and \nvibratory sense, with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense, one or two levels below the \nlesion is seen. Option C: Anterior spinal artery syndrome is caused due to an ASA infarct. It typically presents as \nloss of motor function and pain/temperature sensation, with relative sparing of proprioception \nand vibratory sense below the level of the lesion. Option D: In foramen magnum syndrome, compressive lesions near the foramen magnum may \nproduce weakness of the ipsilateral shoulder and arm followed by weakness of the ipsilateral leg, \nthen the contralateral leg, and finally the contralateral arm.

      "explanation": "The MRI shows a syrinx located at C6–C7 in the cervical spine which is suggestive of \nsyringomyelia. Suspended distribution of sensory deficit is a feature of this condition. Syringomyelia is a developmental cavity of the cervical cord that may enlarge and produce \nprogressive myelopathy or may remain asymptomatic. It presents as a central cord syndrome with unilateral sensory loss in the hands initially. There is a \nloss of pain and temperature sensation with the sparing of touch and vibration. The sensory \ndeficit has a distribution that is 'suspended' over the nape of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms \n(cape distribution) or in the hands. Areflexic weakness is seen in the upper limbs. Extension of the syrinx into the grey matter of the cord causes muscle wasting in the lower neck, \nshoulders, arms, and hands with asymmetric or absent reflexes in the arms. Extension of the \nsyrinx into the medulla (syringobulbia) causes palatal or vocal cord paralysis, dysarthria, \nhorizontal or vertical nystagmus, episodic dizziness or vertigo, and tongue weakness with atrophy. 1166 \nSold by @itachibot",

Dysautonomia due to brain and spinal cord disease above the level of the lumbar spine results \nfirst in increased urinary frequency and small bladder volume. Eventually, incontinence occurs. \nThese features are suggestive of an upper motor neuron lesion, i.e., spastic bladder. On the other hand, dysautonomia due to peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease of autonomic \nnerve fibers results in large bladder volumes, increased urinary frequency, and overflow \nincontinence.
