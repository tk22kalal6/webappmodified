      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary infarction as suggested by CT is typically due to a small pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary infarction occurs when small thrombi lodge in the segmental and subsegmental \nvessels. These patients most often have pleuritic chest pain as the site where the thrombus lodges \nare near the innervation of pleural nerves. Massive pulmonary emboli and saddle emboli that occlude the main pulmonary artery \ncause hypotension and shock as opposed to infarction. These are caused by larger-sized emboli \nthat lodge more proximally in the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary embolism is classified based on the degree of reduction of pulmonary vascular blood \nflow and associated hemodynamic disturbances: • Massive: Hypotension lasting for &gt;15 minutes or BP maintained with inotropes. • Submassive: No hypotension, but features of cardiac injury present. • Non-massive: No hypotension or features of cardiac injury. CT findings associated with pulmonary infarction include a feeding vessel or vessel sign as shown \nbelow. It depicts a distinct vessel feeding directly to a lesion, usually of hematogenous origin. \nHowever, it is not specific for pulmonary infarction. 1042 \nSold by @itachibot",

IVC filters increase the rate of \nrecurrence of DVT (by providing a nidus for clot formation) even though they usually prevent \npulmonary embolism (over the short term). The two principal indications for insertion of an IVC filter are: • Active bleeding (prevents the use of anticoagulation) • Recurrent venous thrombosis despite intensive anticoagulation Prevention of recurrent PE in patients with right heart failure who are not candidates for \nfibrinolysis and prophylaxis of extremely high-risk patients are some other indications for filter \nplacement.

Option A: Most patients with acute PE have normal echocardiograms. However, echocardiography \nis a very useful diagnostic tool for detecting conditions that may mimic PE, such as acute \nmyocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, and aortic dissection. Option C: Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning has become a second-line diagnostic test for PE, \nused mostly for patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast or in whom the CT results are \ninconclusive. Option D: MR pulmonary angiography may detect large proximal PE but is not reliable for smaller \nsegmental and subsegmental PE. It is used when neither CT angiography nor \nventilation-perfusion scan can be done. The images below demonstrate a pulmonary embolus (marked by arrows).

Warfarin inhibits protein C, protein S (which is part of the fibrinolytic pathway) in addition to \nfactors II, VII, IX, X. Protein C has a short half-life (4-6 hours) and thus decreases early. Since \nprotein C is antithrombotic, decreased levels of protein C by warfarin renders the patient \nhypercoagulable during the first few days of treatment before factor II with a long half-life (36 \nhours) decreases and protects the patient from thrombosis.

      "explanation": "This patient is most probably suffering from antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) as her \nlupus anticoagulant is strongly positive. In such patients, the initial anticoagulation is with \nunfractionated heparin and is monitored by anti-Xa tests. Due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant, the lab measurement of aPTT will show erroneously \nprolonged aPTT. Therefore, even though there is an apparently prolonged aPTT, the patient is at \nincreased risk of thrombosis and not bleeding, and hence patients with APS should be \nanticoagulated. Anti Xa tests are not influenced by APS. So, the patient can be monitored for the adequacy of \nanticoagulation with UFH by monitoring anti-Xa. Option A: The patient’s aPTT is already prolonged due to lupus anticoagulant, so we cannot \nmonitor the patient with aPTT after starting unfractionated heparin. Option C: Warfarin in the first few days of therapy, causes a decrease in Protein C &amp; S levels, \ncausing a prothrombotic state.
