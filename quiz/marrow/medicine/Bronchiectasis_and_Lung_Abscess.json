Bronchiectasis is a suppurative lung disease with abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the \nbronchi. It is an end-stage condition of various diseases (infections, congenital or autoimmune \ndisorders) that result in the destruction of the bronchial wall and its surrounding supporting \ntissues. Ried’s classification divides bronchiectasis into 3 types based on the phenotype of the affected \nbronchi: • Cylindrical or tubular (most common) • Saccular or varicose • Cystic Traction bronchiectasis is a type of bronchiectasis seen in conditions causing extensive pulmonary \nfibrosis (tuberculosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). The mechanical traction due to fibrosis pulls \napart the adjacent bronchi, making them distorted and abnormally dilated. There is no \ndestruction of the bronchial wall. Clinically, they have a chronic productive cough, clubbing, crackles, and rhonchi.",

It occurs almost exclusively in \npatients with asthma (~2.5% of patients) or cystic fibrosis (up to 15%). In chronic cases, repeated \nepisodes of bronchial obstruction, inflammation, and mucoid impaction can lead to 646 \nSold by @itachibot bronchiectasis, fibrosis, and respiratory compromise.

      "question": "Question 19: A patient with acute myeloid leukemia underwent induction therapy. Within the next few \ndays, he developed a cough and fever. On evaluation, HRCT showed a halo sign. Eventually, \nthe patient deteriorated and died due to respiratory compromise. On autopsy, lung \nhistopathology showed infarction and invasion of blood vessels by Aspergillus hyphae. Which \nof the following is not true about this condition?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Decreased forced expiratory volume in one second",
        "b": "Increased residual volume",
        "c": "Decreased mean expiratory flow rate",
        "d": "Decreased diffusion capacity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of aspergillosis. Fungal hyphae of Aspergillus species are \nnarrow, septate, and have branching at 45o. Yeast forms of Aspergillus are not seen in infected tissue. Exposure to the high number of conidia that are found in construction sites, hay barns, moldy \nbarks, and composts is a risk factor. Clinical features: • Most of the patients are asymptomatic • Fever • Cough 647 \nSold by @itachibot • Chest discomfort • Trivial hemoptysis • Shortness of breath Halo sign-on HRCT refers to a localized ground glass appearance representing an area of \nhemorrhagic infarction surrounding a nodule. It is seen in invasive aspergillosis, a distinct entity \nwhere there is a direct invasion of hyphae into the lung tissue. The air crescent sign describes the crescent of air that can be seen in invasive aspergillosis. It \nusually heralds recovery and is the result of increased granulocyte activity. Monod sign refers to the gas that surrounds a mycetoma (most commonly an aspergilloma) in a \npre-existing pulmonary cavity. 648 \nSold by @itachibot Pulmonary Function Tests",
