      "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It is characterized by \nchronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss. The peripheral nervous system is spared in MS. The course of the disease may be relapsing-remitting or progressive. The clinical course of \nmanifestation can be variable ranging from a benign condition to a rapidly evolving and \nincapacitating disease. 1188 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In multiple sclerosis, the slowing of conduction is due to the loss of the myelin sheath. Under normal circumstances, nerve conduction in myelinated axons occurs in a saltatory manner \ni.e from one node of Ranvier to another. But, when demyelination sets in, the nerve impulse are \nunable to travel as fast due to not being saltatory. This produces either a conduction block or \ndelay. Lesions due to multiple sclerosis begin with perivenular cuffing by inflammatory mononuclear \ncells. Myelin-specific autoantibodies cause degeneration of myelin sheaths. As lesions evolve, \nprominent astrocytic proliferation (gliosis) is observed. Demyelination is the hallmark in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. But, it is not solely a disease \naffecting the myelin sheath. Partial or total axonal destruction (neuronal loss) can also occur.",
