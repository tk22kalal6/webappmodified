        "a": "Arcuate nucleus",
        "b": "Adipocytes",
        "c": "Chief cells",
        "d": "Paneth cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone. It acts through brain circuits (predominantly in the hypothalamus) to influence appetite, energy \nexpenditure, and neuroendocrine function. High leptin levels reduce appetite and increase energy \nexpenditure. The arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of appetite.",

      "explanation": "One of the key transcription factors involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal preadipocytes \nto adipose cells is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR). It is a nuclear \nreceptor that also binds the thiazolidinedione class of insulin-sensitizing drugs used in the \ntreatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

It is an abundant adipose-derived protein with the following characteristics: • Its levels are reduced in obesity • It enhances insulin sensitivity and lipid oxidation 242 \nSold by @itachibot • Has vascular-protective effects On the other hand, resistin and RBP4 levels, which are also secreted by adipocytes, may induce \ninsulin resistance.",

      "explanation": "The most prominent neuroendocrine abnormality seen in obese individuals with inactivating \nmutations in the leptin (ob gene) or leptin receptor (db gene) is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Leptin mutations are responsible for a rare form of obesity that runs in families. These \nmutations prevent leptin from delivering satiety signals. Hence, the brain perceives starvation \ndespite adequate nutrition. It results in morbid, early-onset obesity. Mutations in the following genes can cause obesity in humans: • Lep (ob) • LepR (db) • POMC • PC-1 • MC4R",

        "d": "Adiponectin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Insulin levels are increased in obesity. It stimulates the synthesis of fatty acids and TAG and \ndecreases the rate of lipolysis. Thyroxine, growth hormone, and adiponectin have lipolytic effects, \nhence their levels are reduced in obesity. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are consistent features of obesity. Insulin resistance is \nmore strongly linked to intra-abdominal fat than to fat in other areas. 243 \nSold by @itachibot Adiponectin (Option D) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is produced by adipocytes. It \nperforms vital functions that are reduced in obesity - like, increasing insulin sensitivity and the \ninhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes. It also enhances fatty acid oxidation. Insulin resistance in obesity occurs as a result of the following: • Insulin receptor downregulation • Increased FFA (free fatty acids) and capable of impairing insulin action • Intracellular lipid accumulation • Circulating peptides produced by adipocytes such as TNF-, IL-6, RBP4, and resistin modify \ninsulin action.",
