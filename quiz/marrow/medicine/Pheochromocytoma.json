      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Norepinephrine is exclusively secreted in patients with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. The PNMT (phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase) enzyme converts norepinephrine to \nepinephrine. This enzyme is absent in extra-adrenal sites. Hence, extra-adrenal \npheochromocytomas secrete only norepinephrine and cannot secrete epinephrine. On the other hand, adrenal pheochromocytomas can secrete norepinephrine, epinephrine, \nand dopamine in varying amounts depending on the PNMT levels in the tumor. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas are most \ncommonly found in the abdomen. They commonly arise from the organ of Zuckerkandl.",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with a history of thyroid cancer (likely medullary carcinoma) and the image \nshowing mucosal neuromas points towards MEN2B syndrome. Her current presentation is \nsuggestive of a pheochromocytoma. She is likely to have predominantly elevated levels \nof epinephrine and its metabolite, metanephrine. This is due to the higher expression of the PNMT enzyme associated with the mutations in MEN2 \nsyndromes (both 2A and 2B). The higher levels of epinephrine result in a more symptomatic \npresentation. In contrast, low PNMT expression is seen in von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. This leads to a \npredominant elevation of norepinephrine and normetanephrine levels. It is less symptomatic \ncompared to MEN2 syndrome.",

      "explanation": "Biopsy and FNAC should be avoided in patients with pheochromocytoma, as it is a highly vascular \ntumor. CT and MRI have similar sensitivity but T2-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast is the optimal \ntest for diagnosis. MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy can be used to localize the \ntumor if both CT and MRI are negative. Genetic testing may be performed as nearly 40% of the tumors are associated with familial \nsyndromes like VHL, neurofibromatosis, and MEN2. Note: In cases of malignant pheochromocytoma, biopsy may be indicated to confirm adrenal \ngland metastasis in other sites. 138 \nSold by @itachibot",

If biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma is positive, an abdominal MRI must be performed \nfirst. If MRI is negative or if multiple tumors are suspected, the tumor can be localized by \nperforming one of the following investigations: • 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET scan - most sensitive, gold standard • Fluorodopa and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans - 97% sensitive • MIBG scintigraphy - least sensitive (94%)",

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of pheochromocytoma. The drug of choice to control blood \npressure prior to surgery is oral phenoxybenzamine at 0.5–4 mg/kg of body weight. It is a \nnon-specific -blocker and is preferred due to its long action (3-4 days). 139 \nSold by @itachibot Other -blockers like oral prazosin and intravenous phentolamine have a shorter duration of \naction and can be used to manage paroxysms. IV phentolamine is also used for intra-operative \nmanagement of BP. -blockers are usually given for 7 days. Following this, -blockers are started, usually 2-3 days \npreoperatively. -blockers should never be started first because blockade of vasodilatory \nperipheral -receptors with unopposed -receptor stimulation can lead to a further elevation in \nblood pressure.

They must be given only after adequate alpha blockade has been established. Blocking \nbeta-receptors may cause unopposed stimulation of alpha-receptors, precipitating a hypertensive \ncrisis. Option A: Prazosin is an alpha-blocker. Option C: Nitroprusside can be used in case of hypertensive emergencies. Option D: Metyrosine inhibits catecholamine synthesis.
