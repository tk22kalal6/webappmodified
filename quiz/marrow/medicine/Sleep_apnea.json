      "explanation": "Sleep apnea is defined as a temporary pause in breathing during sleep lasting at least 10 seconds. Sleep apneas can be further divided into: • Obstructive apneas - Sleep apnea with persistent respiratory effort. • Central apneas - Sleep apnea with an absence of respiratory effort. The gold standard for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is an \novernight polysomnogram (PSG).",

      "explanation": "Arterial blood gases are not part of polysomnography. However, they are usually measured to rule \nout alveolar hypoventilation secondary to lung disease or chest wall abnormalities. An overnight polysomnogram is a multi-parametric test and is the gold standard for the diagnosis \nof obstructive sleep apnea. It includes: • EEG • Eye movements (EOG) • Muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (EMG) • ECG • Respiratory airflow and respiratory effort indicators • Peripheral pulse oximetry • Sleep latency • Sleep efficiency • Arousal index 680 \nSold by @itachibot Other sleep disorders diagnosed by polysomnography: • Narcolepsy • Idiopathic hypersomnia • Periodic limb movement disorder • REM behavior disorder • Parasomnias",

      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of central sleep apnea (CSA), and it is caused by increased \nsensitivity to pCO2. Thus changes in pCO2 levels during sleep lead to an unstable breathing \npattern that manifests as hyperventilation alternating with apnea. Crescendo-decrescendo \nbreathing pattern known as Cheyne-Stokes respiration is seen. Risk factors for CSA: • Heart failure • Opioid medications • Hypoxia (e.g., breathing at high altitude) • Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at high pressures seems to induce central apnea; \nthis condition is referred to as complex sleep apnea.",

      "explanation": "Strychnine is not a risk factor as it does not cause respiratory depression. It is a CNS stimulant. \nOnly drugs that cause respiratory centre depression are risk factors for the development of central 681 \nSold by @itachibot sleep apnea. Option A: Opioids depress the respiratory centre in a dose-dependent manner. Option C: Barbiturates cause respiratory depression in high doses. Option D: Gelsemium is an ergot-type alkaloid and is a CNS depressant. Often used in \nhomoeopathy, in large doses, paralysis and death from respiratory failure can occur.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The breathing pattern shown in the image is suggestive of Cheyne-Stokes respiration. It \nis characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual \ndecrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called apnea. It is caused by an increased sensitivity of the respiratory center to arterial PCO2. There is an \napneic phase, during which arterial PO2 falls and arterial PCO2 rises. These changes in the \narterial blood gas content stimulate the respiratory center, resulting in hyperventilation and \nhypocapnia, followed by recurrence of apnea. It is present in 40% of patients with advanced HF \nand usually is associated with low cardiac output. 682 \nSold by @itachibot",
