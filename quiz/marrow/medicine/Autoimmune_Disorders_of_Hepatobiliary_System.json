      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Presence of viral markers is not a part of the simplified scoring system for diagnosis of \nautoimmune hepatitis. The simplified scoring system includes four variables. They are: • Autoantibodies • Elevated serum IgG level • Typical compatible histologic features 295 \nSold by @itachibot • Absence of viral hepatitis markers The clinical presentation in autoimmune hepatitis is variable and shares features with acute and \nchronic hepatitis of other aetiologies. They usually present with an insidious onset of non-specific \nsymptoms such as fatigue, anorexia and eventually jaundice. It can then progress to extensive \nliver necrosis and liver failure. Autoimmune hepatitis is associated with several autoimmune diseases such as: • Rheumatoid arthritis • Systemic lupus erythematosus • Thyroiditis and Grave's disease • Haemolytic anemia",

There are 2 types of autoimmune hepatitis: Type I (classic) autoimmune hepatitis is often seen in young women. It is linked to HLA-DR3 or \nHLA-DR4. It responds well to steroids and has a better prognosis. The autoantibodies that are \nseen in type I are: • ANA - antinuclear antibodies • ASMA - anti-smooth muscle actin • pANCA - perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic • anti-SLA - anti-soluble liver antigen Type II autoimmune hepatitis is often seen in children. It is linked to HLA-DRB1 or HLA-DQB1. It \nusually leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure. The autoantibodies that are seen in type II are: • Anti-LKM 1 - anti-liver kidney microsomes • Anti-liver cytosol 1",

The dose \nof glucocorticoids is often reduced by combining with azathioprine.

      "explanation": "298 \nSold by @itachibot The presence of ascites and variceal bleeding suggest decompensated liver disease and the \nappropriate treatment is liver transplantation. The first-line drug in primary biliary cholangitis is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). It only slows the \nrate of progression of the disease. It does not provide any symptomatic benefit or cure the disease. Obeticholic acid is another drug used in PBC as monotherapy or in combination with UDCA. It is \na farnesoid X receptor agonist. Liver transplantation is considered when there are signs of decompensation or portal \nhypertension such as ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or malnutrition.",

      "explanation": "Liver biopsy does not establish the diagnosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The diagnosis \nrequires imaging with MRCP. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disorder characterized by \ninflammation and fibrosis of intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts resulting in strictures and \ncholestasis. The cause is unknown. Most patients have underlying ulcerative colitis. It has an \nassociation with HLA DRw52. Patients present with symptoms of cholestasis such as fatigue and \npruritus. The laboratory findings include: • Liver function tests - Elevated ALP and aminotransferases. • Increased serum IgM levels • Positive p-ANCA MRCP is the investigation of choice. It shows multiple strictures in intra and extrahepatic bile \nducts. Liver biopsy reveals a concentric \"onion skin\" fibrosis. This is however not pathognomic of \nPSC. There is no definitive treatment. It involves the administration of UDCA and liver transplantation. PSC can lead to the development of cholangiocarcinoma The image below shows onion-skin fibrosis in PSC. 300 \nSold by @itachibot 301 \nSold by @itachibot Acute Liver Failure and Liver Transplantation",
