      "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis is associated with a decrease in synaptic transmission at the myoneural \njunction. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by weakness and fatigability \nof skeletal muscles. It is due to autoantibody-mediated destruction of the acetylcholine receptors \n(AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. This consequentially leads to a decreased transmission at \nthe neuromuscular (myoneural) junction.",

The anti-AChR antibodies reduce the number of available AChRs at the neuromuscular junction \nusing three distinct mechanisms: • Accelerated turnover of AChRs • Damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane mediated by antibodies and complement • Blockade of the active site of the AChR Patients whose sera test negative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies possess antibodies specific \nto another protein at the neuromuscular junction called low-density lipoprotein receptor-related \nprotein 4 (LRP4). LRP4 plays a functional role in the clustering of AChRs.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Absent deep tendon reflex is not a feature of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG usually occurs in young females. Patients usually present with weakness and fatiguability of \nthe muscles, which worsens on repeated use or late in the day and improves on rest. The cranial \nmuscles, particularly the eyelids and extraocular muscles are involved early in the course of MG. \nDiplopia and ptosis are common initial complaints. When MG becomes generalized, the proximal \nmuscles of the limbs are affected first. Despite the muscle weakness, the deep tendon reflexes \nremain normal. Snarling expression on smiling (facial weakness), nasal timbre of speech \n(weakness of palate and tongue), and difficulty swallowing may be seen. Bulbar weakness and \nrespiratory depression are seen more frequently in MuSK antibody–positive MG. MG is an autoimmune disorder most commonly caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine \nreceptor (AChR). These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and \nincreased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR seems to be \nmediated by the thymus. The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on \ntheir surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen which triggers this autoimmune \nreaction. Thymic hyperplasia is seen in 65% of the patients, and thymomas are seen in 10% of the \npatients. The tests which are used to confirm the diagnosis of MG include: • Anti-AChR antibody immunoassay: 85% of myasthenic patients have detectable anti-AChR \nantibodies, but only 50% of patients with weakness limited to ocular muscles. The presence of \nanti-AChR antibodies is highly suggestive of MG, but a negative test does not exclude the disease. \nAntibodies to MuSK and LRP4 are found in some patients • Recurrent nerve stimulation test: MG shows a decremental response &gt; 10%, while \nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) shows an incremental response • Block and jitter response on single-fiber electromyography • Positive edrophonium test: improvement of ptosis on the administration of anticholinesterase \nsuch as edrophonium • Positive ice-pack test: improvement of ptosis on the application of ice-pack on the affected eye The first line of medical management in MG is anticholinesterase drugs. Pyridostigmine 30–60 \nmg three to four times daily is the most commonly used drug. Patients are evaluated for associated thymic abnormalities using a CT chest. Thymectomy is \nconsidered in patients with thymoma and in generalized MG patients with anti-AChR antibodies. Immunotherapy therapy can be initiated in patients with poor control on pyridostigmine after \nthymectomy. Glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus are generally effective within 1-3 \nmonths. Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil may take several months to show beneficial \neffects and are used for the long-term management of MG. Rituximab has shown effectiveness in \npatients with MuSK antibodies. Intravenous eculizumab, which binds to terminal complement \ncomponent 5, is also effective. Myasthenic crisis is the life-threatening exacerbation of MG leading to respiratory failure. \nTreatment for myasthenic crisis should take place in intensive care units. It is important to rule \nout excessive anticholinesterase medication as a cause of deterioration by temporarily \ndiscontinuing these drugs. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are beneficial 1177 \nSold by @itachibot in hastening recovery.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of myasthenia gravis and ptosis is the most common \nocular feature of the disease. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction most \ncommonly caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The disorder is characterized by \nweakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles where the weakness increases during repeated \nuse and may improve following rest. Ptosis and diplopia are common initial complaints due to early involvement of the lids and \nextraocular muscles (EOMs). Of them, Ptosis is a more common manifestation than diplopia. \nPtosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical. Investigations of myasthenia gravis include: • Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice pack \nfor 2 minutes, as the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. • Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on \nadministration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium. • Antibody testing - for Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MuSK protein antibodies helps \nsupport a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.",

These patients are said to have ocular MG. Ptosis and/or diplopia are the initial symptoms of MG in up to 85% of patients. The ptosis may \nincrease with sustained upward gaze or by holding up the opposite eyelid with the examiner's \nfinger (curtain sign). Cogan lid twitch is characteristic of MG. It refers to a brief overshoot twitch of the lid when the \npatient is made to gaze upwards after a period of downgaze.

Antibodies directed against the P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) interfere with the \nnormal calcium flux required for the release of acetylcholine. Approximately 50% of LEMS cases are associated with malignancy, mainly small cell lung cancer \n(SCLC). Most patients with LEMS present with symptoms as slowly progressive proximal muscle \nweakness. In LEMS, the weakness improves for a while after exertion. Diminished or absent deep \ntendon reflexes help differentiate between LEMS and myasthenia gravis.
