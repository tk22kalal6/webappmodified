      "explanation": "Bethesda assay is the best test for the confirmation of factor VIII inhibitors. The formation of inhibitor/ alloantibodies to FVIII or FIX is the major complication of hemophilia \ntreatment. When this happens, patients do not respond to factor replacement at therapeutic \ndoses. aPTT measurement is done on a mixed sample. It is used to determine the presence of factor VIII \ninhibitors. aPTT is estimated using a 1:1 mix of patient's plasma and normal plasma. It is \ninterpreted as: • In hemophilia, aPTT is corrected with a 1:1 mix. • In patients with inhibitors, aPTT with 1:1 mix is abnormally prolonged (inhibitor neutralizes the \nnormal factors). Bethesda assay is based on the same principle but is superior because it helps to quantify the type \nand specificity of the inhibitor.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by the \nwidespread activation of blood clotting factors within blood vessels, resulting in a loss of clotting \ncontrol. The primary mechanism of DIC involves the uncontrolled generation of thrombin \nthrough multiple pathways which leads to sustained coagulation activation, the formation of \nfibrin, and the consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Infections are the most frequent cause of DIC. Laboratory investigations in DIC: • Decreased platelet count • Prolonged PT/TT • Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) • Decreased fibrinogen • Elevated fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) • Peripheral smear: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in DIC with schistocytes (fragmented red \nblood cells) The treatment involves platelet transfusion when platelet counts are below 10,000-20,000/L. \nReplacement of fibrinogen and coagulation factors is with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) along with \ncryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Serotonin release assay is the most specific test for the diagnosis of heparin-induced \nthrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is commonly diagnosed clinically by means of 4T scoring (Thrombocytopenia, Timing of \nplatelet count fall, Thrombosis, Other causes for Thrombocytopenia). Serotonin release assay is performed by quantifying serotonin release. Platelets loaded with labeled serotonin are exposed to patient serum in the absence or presence of \nvarying concentrations of heparin. If the patient serum contains the HIT antibody, heparin \naddition induces platelet activation and serotonin release. Enzyme-linked assays such as platelet activation assay and heparin-PF-4 complex antibody assay \nare sensitive but not specific for HIT. 1455 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Patients on warfarin who present with severe bleeding are treated with both IV infusion of \nvitamin K and fresh frozen plasma regardless of the INR. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that blocks the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. \nThis inhibits factors II, VII, IX, and X, proteins C and S. This can cause an initial procoagulant \nstate. Since the anticoagulant action of warfarin takes 2-3 days, patients require concomitant treatment \n(bridging therapy) with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant (heparin, LMWH or \nfondaparinux) for at least 5 days. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, hence all patients on warfarin should have their INR \ndetermined every 3–4 weeks. The most common side effect of warfarin is bleeding.
