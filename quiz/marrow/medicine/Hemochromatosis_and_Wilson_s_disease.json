Many patients with C282Y mutations are initially asymptomatic and do not show features of iron \noverload. In such patients, serum ferritin can indicate whether they are likely to develop the \ndisease as ferritin levels reflect the total iron stores. As ferritin levels may be high following inflammatory conditions, combined measurement of \nferritin and transferrin saturation is done in a practical setting to avoid false positives. It is also \nrepeated once inflammation subsides. If these tests are abnormal, genetic testing for HFE \nmutations is done.",

Phlebotomy is an inexpensive, convenient, and safe method of treatment. In this process, 500 mL \nof blood is removed 1-2 times weekly which removes 200-250 mg of iron. Weekly phlebotomy \nshould be continued until the serum ferritin level is 100 g/L and every 3 months thereafter. It is \ncontraindicated in severe anemia and hypoproteinemia. Chelating agents bind to iron to form complexes that get excreted and are the drugs of choice. \nDrugs such as deferoxamine and deferasirox are commonly used. However, they are less effective 322 \nSold by @itachibot and more expensive than phlebotomy. Liver transplantation is indicated either in end-stage liver disease or in refractory cases.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Wilson’s disease is caused due to a loss-of-function mutation in the ATP7B gene on Chr.13q. The \ngene encodes a copper transporting ATPase (ATP7B) which has 2 functions: • Maintains copper in bound form by binding copper to apoceruloplasmin • Helps excrete free copper in bile. Thus, an ATP7B deficiency leads to excess deposition of free copper within tissues. It is an \nautosomal recessive condition. So, siblings of affected children have a 1 in 4 chance. Intracellular trafficking of ATP7B (Wilson's disease) and ATP7A (Menke's disease) genes are \nregulated by an adaptor protein encoded by the AP1S1 gene. Mutations in this gene result in a \nsyndrome with features of both Wilson's and Menke's diseases. It is called MEDNIK syndrome: • Mental retardation • Enteropathy • Deafness • Neuropathy • Ichthyosis • Keratodermia.",

In majority of the cases, neuropsychiatric manifestations follow hepatic manifestations. It is due \nto the deposition of free copper in the basal ganglia (leading to bilateral degeneration and \natrophy) and cortex.
