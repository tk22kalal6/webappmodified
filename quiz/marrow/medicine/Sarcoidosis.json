The investigations used in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis include: • Serum ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels - elevated • BAL- lymphocytosis and increased CD4/CD8 ratio. A ratio of &gt;3.5 in BAL is strongly \nsupportive of sarcoidosis. • PET-CT scan - to identify areas of granulomatous disease • Gallium scan shows the following signs: • Panda sign- due to bilateral involvement of parotid and lacrimal glands in sarcoidosis • Lambda sign- due to bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes which resembles lambda \n() • Biopsy showing non-caseating granulomas in a patient with features of sarcoidosis confirms the \ndiagnosis.
