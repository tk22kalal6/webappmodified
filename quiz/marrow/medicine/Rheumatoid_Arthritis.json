The addition of leflunomide or a biological (anti - TNF) to methotrexate \nis another alternative. Ideally, the approach to a patient with early RA is aggressive. Methotrexate is always the first \nDMARD that the patient is started on, and if an adequate response is not observed within 3-6 \nmonths, a step up in therapy is made by adding on drugs. For assessment of progression, composite indices like Disease Activity Score - 28 (DAS-28) can \nused. Other options: Option A: Changing the route of administration of methotrexate from oral to parenteral is not a \npart of step up Option C: Priority is given to minimising the duration the patient is on steroids. Option D: Anti -TNF agents (adalimumab, etanercept) are not recommended as a monotherapy, \nand are reserved for treatment in combination with DMARDs. This is due to the fact that the \nefficacy of monotherapy is lesser than that of DMARDs, and the adverse effects include increased \nrisk of serious infections, re-activation of latent TB and opportunistic fungal infections.
