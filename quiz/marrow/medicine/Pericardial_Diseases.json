      "explanation": "Clinically, acute pericarditis is of &lt;6 weeks duration. Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardial sac. This inflammation can lead to excessive \nsecretion of the pericardial fluid leading to pericardial effusion. When the accumulation of fluid \ncauses obstruction to the inflow of blood into the ventricles, it is called cardiac tamponade. Clinically, pericarditis is classified as: • Acute - &lt; 6 weeks • Subacute - 6 weeks to 6 months • Chronic - &gt; 6 months",

Beck’s triad is seen in cardiac tamponade and it includes: • Hypotension • Soft or absent heart sounds • Jugular venous distension Cardiac tamponade is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space significant enough to \ncause an obstruction to the inflow of blood to the ventricles.

The breath sounds are absent in tension pneumothorax while they are present in cardiac \ntamponade. The presence of hypotension, distended jugular veins, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad) \nsuggest a cardiac tamponade. These features can also be seen in tension pneumothorax. Other \nclinical features pointing towards tension pneumothorax are absent breath sounds, hyper \nresonance to percussion, and shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side. Heart sounds can be muffled by structures between the stethoscope and the heart, eg, adipose \ntissue deposition (obesity), fluid accumulation (pericardial effusion, pleural effusion), gas \naccumulation (pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema), soft tissue masses can lead to \nattenuation of heart sounds.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The patient with cardiac tamponade is asked to breathe normally to elicit pulsus paradoxus. In a patient with cardiac tamponade, both ventricles share an incompressible pericardial covering \ndue to the fluid. As the right ventricle enlarges during inspiration, the interventricular septum \nbulges into the left ventricle, reducing the left ventricular volume. This results in reduced stroke volume and hence reduced systolic arterial pressure. As a result, there is a greater than normal (more than 10 mmHg) fall in systolic arterial blood \npressure during inspiration, producing pulsus paradoxus. This cannot be elicited if the patient is holding his/her breath, taking long or shallow breaths. 1014 \nSold by @itachibot Pulsus paradoxus is also seen with effusive constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy \nand right ventricular myocardial infarction.",

      "explanation": "The presence of hypotension, distended jugular veins, and absence of heart sounds (Beck's \ntriad) are suggestive of cardiac tamponade. An urgent pericardial tap needs to be done to relieve \nthe tension on the heart chambers. Although these features could be seen in tension pneumothorax as well, the presence of adequate \nbilateral air entry excludes this diagnosis. Pericardiocentesis, also known as pericardial tap, can be performed with sub-xiphoid, parasternal, \nor apical approaches. The most common approach is a sub-xiphoid approach under \nechocardiographic guidance. Option A: Rapid blood transfusion is needed in massive blood loss indicated by hypotension. \nAlthough this patient presents with hypotension, it is most likely a result of cardiac tamponade. \nAlthough blood transfusion is indicated, it will be effective only when the pericardial tap \ndecompresses the pericardium. Option C: Intercostal tube drainage is done in tension pneumothorax. The presence of adequate \nair entry bilaterally excludes this diagnosis. Option D: The fixation of femur fracture and femoral artery is not a priority here. The inability to \npalpate pulses distal to the fracture could be a result of hypotension.

      "explanation": "A rise or a lack of fall in JVP with inspiration is known as Kussmaul's sign. It is not seen in cardiac \ntamponade. Normally, in inspiration due to the negative intrathoracic pressure and increased intrathoracic \nvolume, the capacity of the right heart increases and the JVP falls. In conditions where the \nmyocardium or pericardium is poorly compliant, it does not allow the right heart chambers to \naccommodate more blood and this fall is not seen. In fact, due to an increase in venous return \nduring inspiration, the JVP might rise. This is called Kussmaul's sign. This is seen in: • Restrictive cardiomyopathy • Constrictive pericarditis • Massive pulmonary embolism • Right ventricular infarcts 1017 \nSold by @itachibot • Advanced cases of left ventricular systolic failure Kussmaul’s sign is not seen in patients with cardiac tamponade because even though the increase \nin pericardial pressure exerts an inward force compressing the entire heart during inspiration, the \nincrease in negative intrathoracic pressure is still transmitted to the right side of the heart.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a young male developing respiratory distress with hypotension, \nsubcutaneous emphysema, and unilaterally absent air entry is suggestive of tension \npneumothorax. The immediate next step, in this case, would be needle decompression at the fifth \nintercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line (as the patient is an adult). In children, the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line is chosen as the site for needle \ndecompression. Needle decompression turns a tension pneumothorax into an open pneumothorax. It has to be \nfollowed by tube thoracostomy. An intercostal chest drain (ICD) tube is inserted in the triangle of \nsafety, just anterior to the midaxillary line on the side of the lung injury. The site of insertion is \nthe same in both children and adults. The triangle of safety is bounded by the lateral border of the pectoralis major anteriorly, the \nanterior border of the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, and the fifth intercostal space inferiorly, with \nthe apex below the axilla. This provides a safe landmark for the insertion of an ICD with minimal \nrisk of tissue injury. 1018 \nSold by @itachibot Tension pneumothorax is a condition where air accumulates in the pleural space due to a one-way \nvalve air leak, leading to the collapse of the affected lung. This can cause a mediastinal shift, \ncompression of the opposite lung, and decreased venous return, resulting in obstructive shock. It \ncommonly occurs during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, but can also happen after chest \ntrauma, subclavian/internal jugular venous catheter insertion, or chest wall defects. The diagnosis \nis clinical, and immediate treatment is necessary without waiting for radiological confirmation. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, \ntracheal deviation away from the side of injury, absent breath sounds on the affected side, \ncyanosis, and neck vein distention. Patients can also develop subcutaneous emphysema as a \ncomplication secondary to the pneumothorax. 1019 \nSold by @itachibot Pulmonary Hypertension",
