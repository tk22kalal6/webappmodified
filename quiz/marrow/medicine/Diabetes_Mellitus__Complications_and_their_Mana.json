      "explanation": "In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), serum bicarbonate is usually &lt; 15. Serum HCO3 &gt; 15 meq/L \nis suggestive of alcoholic ketoacidosis. DKA is an acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is usually precipitated by absolute or \nrelative insulin deficiency caused by increased metabolic demand (infections) or insulin \nnoncompliance. The common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. The common signs \ninclude Kussmaul breathing, fruity odor of the breath, dehydration, tachycardia, hypotension, \nand delirium. The diagnosis of DKA is made based on the following parameters: • Hyperglycemia &gt; 250 mg/dl • Ketosis or ketones in urine • Metabolic acidosis with pH &lt; 7.3 • HCO3 &lt; 15-18 mEq/L • High anion gap due to ketoacids and lactic acidosis Hyponatremia is seen as a result of hyperglycemia (osmotic shift causes dilutional hyponatremia). \nNormal sodium levels on admission indicate severe dehydration. Despite a total-body potassium \ndeficit, the serum Potassium at presentation may be mildly elevated, secondary to the acidosis and \nvolume depletion.",

The mainstay of treatment is the administration of normal saline followed by infusion of \nshort-acting insulin. The precipitating event must be identified and treated. Careful monitoring \nof K+ levels and replacement in the later stages is required, as insulin therapy causes \nhypokalemia.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Cerebral edema is the leading cause of mortality in children with diabetic ketoacidosis. The osmolar gradient generated due to the high blood glucose level results in water shift from the \nintracellular fluid (ICF) to the extracellular fluid (ECF) space and leads to the contraction of cell \nvolume. Correction with insulin and intravenous fluids can result in a rapid reduction in effective \nosmolarity, reversal of the fluid shift, and result in cerebral edema. Complications of diabetic ketoacidosis include: • Cerebral edema – especially in children • Cardiac arrhythmia - due to electrolyte imbalance • Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) • Venous thrombosis • Acute gastric dilation • Acute kidney injury • Intestinal necrosis • Acute pancreatitis • Mucormycosis",

      "explanation": "In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe abdominal pain can mimic acute pancreatitis. Serum lipase \nis the best test to rule out this condition. It must then be confirmed by imaging (USG or CT \nabdomen). Serum amylase is an unreliable indicator as DKA is associated with hyperamylasemia of salivary \norigin. Serum and urine trypsinogen may be elevated in early pancreatitis but are not used for diagnosis. \nFecal elastase is elevated in chronic pancreatitis.",

If the initial serum potassium &lt; 3.3 meq/L, insulin should be \nadministered only after the correction of hypokalemia. This is because treatment with insulin and fluids can worsen hypokalemia by the following \nmechanisms: • Insulin causes the shift of K+ ions into cells • Resolution of the acidosis also promotes K+ entry into cells • Urinary loss of K+ salts of organic acids",

      "explanation": "Hypotension and tachycardia are common features of both hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state \n(HHS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In DKA, insulin deficiency and an increase in counter-regulatory hormones lead to shunting of \nfree fatty acids to form ketone bodies. The ketoacids increase the anion gap and cause low pH.

The most common \npattern is as follows: • Increased triglyceride levels - due to increased glucose and free fatty acids, decreased lipolysis of \nVLDL. • Decreased HDL levels Though diabetes does not increase LDL levels, there is increased atherogenicity as the existing \nLDL molecules are more easily glycated and susceptible to oxidation.",

On the other hand, patients with \ntype 2 diabetes are exposed to hyperglycemia and prediabetes for a long time even before \ndiagnosis. Hence, at the time of diagnosis, patients with type 2 diabetes are considered to have \nhad the disorder for a duration sufficiently long to produce kidney disease.

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of silent hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient. The most likely \ncause is autonomic neuropathy. 204 \nSold by @itachibot Hypoglycemia presents with symptoms like palpitation, tremors, and sweating as a result \nof sympathetic stimulation. These symptoms are protective and provide advance warning before \nprogression to neuroglucopenia. However, in autonomic neuropathy, there is a reduced release of counterregulatory hormones \nlike catecholamines. Hence, the classical symptoms of hypoglycemia do not occur and the patient \ndirectly presents with features of neuroglucopenia. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness. The use of beta-blockers can also cause hypoglycemia unawareness.",

      "explanation": "Legacy effect or metabolic memory can be observed in relation to glycemic control during early \ndisease in patients with diabetes mellitus. Intensive glycemic control during the early stages of the disease has a positive effect on long-term \nmicrovascular and macrovascular complications (statement 1) even if this intensive glycemic \ncontrol is not maintained long term. Similarly, uncontrolled blood glucose levels in the early \nstages causes an increased risk of these complications (statement 5). This phenomenon is called \nlegacy effect and is attributed to metabolic memory. In patients with longstanding diabetes, intensive glycemic control at later stages can improve \nmicrovascular complications but has no effect on macrovascular complications. 205 \nSold by @itachibot",
