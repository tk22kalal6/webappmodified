Severe hypertension (grade 3) is generally defined as blood pressure 180/110 mmHg. \nHypertensive emergency, hypertensive urgency, and malignant hypertension are all forms of \nsevere hypertension.

Option B: Patient 2 has a BP &gt; 180/110 mmHg along with symptoms of hypertensive \nencephalopathy.
