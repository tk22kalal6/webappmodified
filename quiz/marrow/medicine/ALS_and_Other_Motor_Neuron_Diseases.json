      "explanation": "Bulbar paralysis refers to LMN palsy of cranial nerves 9 to 12. It is seen due to disease processes \naffecting primarily the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves. The manifestations of bulbar palsy include paralysis of tongue, muscles of swallowing, and facial \nmuscles. There is difficulty handling secretions and maintaining an airway. Causes of bulbar palsy include: • GBS • Polio • Syringobulbia",

This is then \nreferred to as bulbar-onset ALS",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves the anterior horn cells and corticospinal tract. ALS is the most common form of progressive motor neuron disease. The pathologic hallmark of motor neuron degenerative disorders is the death of lower motor \nneurons and upper, or corticospinal, motor neurons. LMN consist of anterior horn cells in the \nspinal cord and their brainstem homologs innervating bulbar muscles. UMN originate in layer five \nof the motor cortex and descend via the pyramidal tract to synapse with lower motor neurons, \neither directly or indirectly via interneurons. Although at its onset, ALS may cause selective loss of function of only upper or lower motor \nneurons, it ultimately causes progressive loss of both categories of motor neurons.",

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The clinical hallmark of ALS is the presence of signs and symptoms of both upper and lower \nmotor neuron (UMN + LMN) dysfunction. The signs of UMN dysfunction include spasticity and \nbrisk jaw jerk, while the signs of LMN dysfunction include atrophy and weakness of limbs. Conventional MRI is usually normal in ALS and is used to exclude other possible causes although \nincreased signal in the corticospinal tracts on T2-weighted MRI is supportive of the diagnosis of \nALS. 1238 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given scenario with both UMN (positive Babinski sign) and LMN (absent reflexes and wasting \nof muscles) signs are suggestive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is also known as Lou \nGehrig's disease, after the famous New York Yankee baseball player who was affected with the \ndisorder. ALS was first described by Charcot in the 19th century and is also referred to as Charcot's disease. Option A: Kennedy disease is a gradually progressive neuromuscular disorder characterised by \nwasting of proximal and bulbar muscles. It is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor gene. Option C: Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is an inherited leukodystrophy characterized by \nproblems with coordination, motor skills, and learning. Option D: Charcot-Marie-tooth disease encompasses a group of hereditary sensory and motor \nneuropathies.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This condition is linked \nto mutations of the gene encoding copper-zinc (Cu, Zn) superoxide dismutase type 1 \n(SOD1). Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALS cases. Option B: Mutations in the NADPH oxidase genes cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Option C: Hereditary deficiency of myeloperoxidase (MPO) predisposes to immune deficiency. Option D: Glutathione peroxidase deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia.",

      "explanation": "Orthostatic hypotension is not a feature seen in classical ALS. Autonomic symptoms are not \nclassically seen in ALS, although a few cases with autonomic insufficiency have been reported and \nthese are classified separately as ALS-plus syndromes. Option A: The split-hand syndrome describes a frequent pattern of weakness and atrophy in ALS \nthat predominantly involves the median and ulnar-innervated lateral (thenar) hand intrinsic \nmuscles with relative sparing of the medial (hypothenar) muscles. Option C: There is a well-established link between ALS and frontotemporal executive dysfunction \n(dementia) that may precede or follow the onset of upper and/or lower motor neuron dysfunction Option D: Dropped head syndrome is an important clinical sign in ALS caused by severe neck \nextensor weakness (LMN), which leads to an inability to maintain level head position. 1239 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The patient with bowel and bladder dysfunction is unlikely to have ALS as these findings are not \nseen in ALS. Even in the late stages of the ALS, sensory &amp; bowel &amp; bladder functions are \npreserved. Fasciculations, muscle cramps, weakness, atrophy, and bulbar palsy are LMN features seen in \nALS. Spasticity, increased reflexes, flexor spasms, and pseudobulbar palsy are UMN features in ALS. A frequent bulbar UMN symptom seen in ALS is the pseudobulbar affect. This is manifested as \ninappropriate laughing, crying, or yawning. The observed affect is often mood incongruent or may \nbe triggered by stimuli that would not have elicited such a response prior to the development of \npseudobulbar affect.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The diagnosis of ALS is based on clinical criteria that include the presence of upper motor neuron \nand lower motor neuron signs, the progression of the disease, and the absence of an alternative \nexplanation. There is no single diagnostic test that can confirm or entirely exclude the diagnosis of motor \nneuron disease in general and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in particular. The revised El Escorial criteria and, more recently, the newer Awaji criteria are being used for the \ndiagnosis of ALS. Practically, the diagnosis is made when it is suggested by the history and physical examination, \nsupported by electrodiagnostic studies (EMG &amp; NCS), and not excluded by neuroimaging \n(MRI) and laboratory studies (CSF, blood, and urine analysis). Increased signal in the \ncorticospinal tracts on T2-weighted MRI, if seen, is supportive of the diagnosis of ALS Muscle biopsy is not a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation of ALS but should be performed if \nthere is clinical suspicion of inflammatory myopathy. Genetic testing is not a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation in ALS except in cases where \nfamilial ALS (10%) is suspected.",

It is a neuroprotective drug that blocks \nglutamatergic neurotransmission in the CNS. Edaravone is a newer drug that is a free radical scavenger. It is thought to reduce oxidative stress, \nwhich has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Edaravone was found to slow functional \ndeterioration in some patients with ALS.
