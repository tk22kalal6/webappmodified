In susceptible individuals, there is a loss of negative feedback, leading to excess calcium \nabsorption when there is excess intake. It results in the following triad of clinical features: • Hypercalcemia • Alkalosis - due to HCO3 reabsorption caused by PTH suppression, natriuresis, and water \ndepletion. • Renal failure - due to damage to renal tubules. It is reversible once ingestion of antacid is stopped. However, in severe cases, a chronic form \ncalled Burnett’s syndrome can develop. It is associated with irreversible renal damage.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Calcitonin levels are increased in hyperparathyroidism. Due to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in hyperparathyroidism, there is osteoclast \nactivation. This leads to increased calcium levels in plasma. As a response to this, there is an \nincrease in the level of calcitonin to regulate the high calcium levels. Calcitonin is secreted by the parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid gland. Its principal effects are to \nlower serum calcium and phosphate by its action on bone and kidney. In bone, calcitonin inhibits \nosteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. In the kidney, it inhibits the reabsorption of both \ncalcium and phosphate. Other options Option A: In hyperthyroidism, the direct effect of thyroid hormones can lead to bone resorption \nand mild hypercalcemia. However, hyperparathyroidism is a better answer. Options B and D: Hypoparathyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome will have low serum calcium and \nhence, will not have increased calcitonin levels.",

Option A: Paget's disease causes cortical thickening, which results in increased opacity on all sides \nof the vertebral body. These are called picture frame vertebrae.

Though this finding is similar to rugger jersey 232 \nSold by @itachibot spine, it is denser and more sharply defined than rugger jersey spine. In addition, there \nis sclerosis of inner margins of vertebral bodies, resulting in a bone within a bone appearance.

Other features in the hand include: • Widened joint spaces (due to cartilage hypertrophy) • Generalized osteoporosis and cystic changes in the carpal bones Option A: Hyperparathyroidism causes subperiosteal bone resorption, which is marked along the \nradial aspect of the middle phalanges of the index and middle fingers. Option B: Down's syndrome can cause hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 5th finger. Option C: Psoriasis causes a pencil-in-cup appearance of the distal phalanx.",

It \nshould be used within the first 24 hours Forced diuresis refers to aggressive fluid hydration with loop diuretic administration. Although \nthis is an effective method to reduce calcium levels, it requires careful monitoring for adverse \neffects like fluid overload, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesia.

        "a": "Can occur due to hypermagnesemia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Hypocalcemia is a feature of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Hypocalcemia refers to total serum calcium 8.4 mg/dl. The causes include: • Low PTH • Hypoparathyroidism • High PTH (SHPT) • Chronic kidney disease • Vitamin D deficiency • Pseudohypoparathyroidism 236 \nSold by @itachibot • Hyperphosphatemia • Loop diuretics, calcitonin, bisphosphonates • Massive blood transfusions • Hyperventilation • Hypomagnesemia - Mg is essential for PTH release • Severe hypermagnesemia - higher Mg levels suppress PTH secretion Hypocalcemia causes tetany or increased neuromuscular excitability. It can cause paresthesias, \ncramps, spasms, and seizures. Latent tetany can only be detected by performing Chvostek and \nTrousseau's signs. A prolonged QT interval is seen on ECG.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above image indicates Trousseau's sign or carpopedal spasm classically seen in patients \nwith hypocalcemia. Trousseau's sign is elicited by making the forearm ischemic by applying a sphygmomanometer \ncuff to the arm and keeping the pressure above systolic blood pressure (SBP) for 5 minutes. The \nhand goes into a painful carpopedal spasm and assumes the accoucheur’s hand position. Hypocalcemia results in tetany or increased neuromuscular irritability. It leads to paresthesia and \ntingling of extremities and perioral area. Severe hypocalcemia can cause seizures. Option A: Chvostek's sign is also seen in hypocalcemia. Tapping the facial nerve in front of the \ntragus will cause spasms of the facial muscles. Option C: Tinel's sign is seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. It refers to a tingling sensation on \ntapping over the median nerve. Option D: Troisier's sign refers to left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy in metastatic abdominal \nmalignancy.",

      "explanation": "Etidronate is not used in the management of hypocalcemia. It is a bisphosphonate used in the \nmanagement of hypercalcemia. The goal in the management of hypoparathyroidism is to restore the calcium-phosphate balance. \nThe mainstay is calcium and vitamin D supplements. Other underlying conditions must also be \ntreated. Instead of loop diuretics, thiazides can be administered on a low sodium diet as they enhance \nurinary calcium reabsorption. 237 \nSold by @itachibot Obesity",
