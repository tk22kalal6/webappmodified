      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The clinical features are suggestive of meningococcal meningitis and the drug of choice is a \nthird-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone. Chloramphenicol is used in patients with \npenicillin allergy. It is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative, oxidase-positive, catalase-positive \ndiplococci. Outbreaks usually occur in mass gatherings such as in army camps or hostel dorms. The risk of infection is increased in patients with terminal complement deficiency, \nhypogammaglobulinemia and hyposplenism. This is because opsonization by complement is a \nmajor mechanism by which the bacteria is cleared from the blood. Characteristic clinical findings include: • Maculopapular or purpuric rash • Shock due to capillary leak • Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome) Rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and cephalosporins can be used to treat carriers.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the drug of choice for empirical treatment of meningococcal \nmeningitis. However, Penicillin G remains the antibiotic of choice for susceptible strains. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is initiated in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis before \nthe results of CSF Gram stain and culture are known. S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis are the most common etiologic organisms of \ncommunity-acquired bacterial meningitis. Due to the emergence of penicillin-resistant and \ncephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, empirical therapy of community-acquired suspected \nbacterial meningitis should include a combination of: • Dexamethasone • Third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefepime) • Vancomycin • Acyclovir - HSV encephalitis is the main differential 1271 \nSold by @itachibot • Doxycycline - during tick season. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime provides better coverage for susceptible S. pneumoniae, H. \ninfluenzae and group B streptococci and good coverage for N. meningitidis. Cefepime is a \nbroad-spectrum fourth-generation cephalosporin with activity similar to that of cefotaxime or \nceftriaxone against S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis with additional greater activity against \nEnterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

      "explanation": "Ciprofloxacin is used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal meningitis for close contacts. \nCeftriaxone and rifampicin are also used. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis among close contacts of a patient with invasive meningococcal \ndisease is recommended to prevent secondary cases. • Rifampin - was earlier used widely, but is not optimal due to the high risk of adverse events, \nemerging resistance, and the need for compliance for four doses. • Ciprofloxacin - widely used as a single oral dose, but it cannot be given in pregnancy and those \nbelow 18 years of age. • Ceftriaxone - can be given in pregnancy and all ages as a single IM or IV dose. However, reduced \nsusceptibility of isolates to ceftriaxone has occasionally been reported.
