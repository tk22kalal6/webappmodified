      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In hemodialysis, the dialyzer is made up of biocompatible membranes derived from \npolysulfone. Cellulose is bio-incompatible and is no longer used. Hemodialysis is based on the principle of solute diffusion using an artificial semi-permeable \nmembrane. Smaller molecules (urea) diffuse faster and are cleared more efficiently than larger \nmolecules (creatinine). There are three components to this system: • Dialyzer - a chamber that contains compartments for blood and dialysate solution, separated by \na semipermeable membrane. • Dialysate - a solution that helps in the removal of metabolic waste products. Bicarbonate is used \nas a buffer to correct acidosis in CKD patients. • Blood delivery system - consists of the vascular access and extracorporeal circuit. The dialyzers used during a session of dialysis are reprocessed and reused for the next dialysis \nsessions. The reprocessors used for dialyzers are: • Glutaraldehyde • Formaldehyde • Peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide The following image depicts hemodialysis.",

      "explanation": "The most common complication of arteriovenous (AV) grafts is stenosis, not infections. 739 \nSold by @itachibot In order to perform hemodialysis, vascular or hemodialysis access must first be established. The \npreferred site is the forearm. The following types of vascular access may be used for hemodialysis: • AV fistulas: • Fistula refers to the anastomosis of an artery and an adequately large vein (either side-to-side or \nend-to-side). • This causes arterialization of the vein, thereby causing venous wall thickening and increasing \nvenous diameter. • Fistulas need 4-6 weeks to mature before they can be used. • The access of choice is radiocephalic AV fistula (Brescia-Cimino fistula). • Fistulas have higher long-term patency rates than grafts. • Thrombosis is a common complication. The following image depicts a radiocephalic fistula. • AV grafts: • The artery and vein are connected by a prosthetic graft such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). • The advantage is that it can be performed with smaller veins. • Complications include stenosis (most common), due to intimal hyperplasia at anastomosis \nbetween graft and vein, and infections. • Central venous catheter: • Tunneled catheters are used for long-term IV access. As they tunnel through the skin before \nentering the vein, they have a lower risk of infection.",

Nearly 52% of transplant recipients have histological evidence of diabetic kidney \ndisease/mesangial sclerosis at 10 years after transplantation.
