      "question": "Question 1: The airport authority sent a COVID-19 suspect patient to the designated district hospital for a \nconsultation. He came positive on RT-PCR testing. As the duty doctor, you observe that he \nhas mild symptoms that can be treated on an outpatient basis. What will be your \nrecommendation?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is a mild case of COVID-19 who can be recommended home isolation for a \nduration of 7 days from testing positive. Isolation is the separation and restriction of movements or activities of persons who are sick, to \nprevent the transmission of disease. Eligibility for home isolation: • Clinically assigned as a mild or asymptomatic case • Facility at their residence for self-isolation and for quarantining the family contacts • Availability of a caregiver • Must monitor his health regularly and inform his health status to the district surveillance officer The patient can end home isolation after 7 days from testing positive and no fever for 3 successive \ndays. There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over. The patient should seek medical help if he/she develops: • Unresolved High-grade fever (more than 100° F for more than 3 days) • Difficulty in breathing, • Dip in oxygen saturation (SpO2  93% on room air at least 3 readings within 1 hour) or \nrespiratory rate &gt;24/ min • Persistent pain/pressure in the chest • Mental confusion or inability to arouse • Severe fatigue and myalgia Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious \ndisease to see if they become sick. 1539 \nSold by @itachibot",

Awake proning in moderate COVID disease is recommended for any patient with severe \nrespiratory distress. It improves oxygenation by keeping the alveolar units open. Timely proning \nof patients with SpO2 &lt; 94% can help reduce mortality. Steps for self-proning: • 1 pillow below the neck • 1 or 2 pillows below the chest through upper thighs • 2 pillows below the shins • Keep alternating between proning, laying on your right, sitting up, and laying on your left, in a \nlying position, ideally for not more than 30 minutes in each position with an upper limit of 2 \nhours. • One may prone up to 16 hours a day, in multiple cycles, if tolerable.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This patient has persistent hypoxia after an adequate trial of standard oxygen therapy and should \nbe started on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. When respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving \nstandard oxygen therapy, high–flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNO), or non–invasive \nventilation can be considered. Compared to standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for \nintubation. Patients on HFNO should be closely monitored, and endotracheal intubation should be done if the \npatient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (about 1 hr). Contraindications to HFNO includes patients with: • Hypercapnia (exacerbation of COPD) • Hemodynamic instability • Multi-organ failure • Abnormal mental status Note: If an high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or simple nasal cannula is used to administer O2, an \nN95 mask should be applied over it.",

      "explanation": "A maximum tidal volume of up to 8 ml/kg PBW is allowed in a patient with ARDS who is being \nmechanically ventilated. In patients with ARDS, mechanical ventilation should be implemented using lower tidal volumes \n(4–8 ml/kg PBW) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure &lt;30 cmH2O).

Commonly performed aerosol-generating procedures are: • Open suctioning of the respiratory tract • Bronchoscopy • Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) • Non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP) • Endotracheal intubation and extubation • Manual ventilation It is recommended that healthcare providers should be protected with PPE while performing \nthese procedures.

Prophylactic anticoagulation is used in the management of moderate and severe COVID cases.

Tocilizumab acts by IL-6 inhibition. It may be considered in moderate-severe COVID patients \nwith progressively increasing oxygen requirements and mechanically ventilated patients not \nimproving despite the use of steroids. Patients should be carefully monitored for secondary \ninfections and neutropenia after treatment with tocilizumab. It is contraindicated in: • HIV • Active infections (systemic bacterial/fungal) • Tuberculosis • Active hepatitis • Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 2000/mm3 • Platelet count &lt; 1,00,000/mm3 Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The \nFDA has issued an emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab for the treatment of adult and \npediatric mild to moderate COVID patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 \nkilograms) who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or \nhospitalization. Possible side effects include anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions, nausea, \ndiarrhea, dizziness, headache, itching, and vomiting. There is no specific contraindication for this \ndrug. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that works by inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It may \nbe considered in moderate and severe hospitalized COVID patients requiring supplemental \noxygen/oxygen delivery through a high flow device/ noninvasive ventilation/ invasive mechanical \nventilation/ ECMO. It is contraindicated in: • AST/ALT &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal • Severe renal impairment (i.e., eGFR &lt; 30ml/min/m2 or need for hemodialysis) • Pregnancy or lactating females • Children &lt;12 years of age Convalescent plasma therapy is no longer recommended in the management of COVID patients, \nas per the revised guidelines. Dexamethasone is generally given to all patients of moderate and severe COVID-19.
