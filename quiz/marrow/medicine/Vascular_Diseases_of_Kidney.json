Blood transfusion is not preferred in \nTTP as it can aggravate the condition. TTP is a type of thrombotic microangiopathy that occurs due to deficiency or autoantibodies \nagainst the ADAMTS13 metalloprotease, which is responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor \nmultimers.

Renal artery stenosis is a relatively common finding in older patients with chronic essential \nhypertension. However, it is considered clinically significant only when renovascular hypertension \ndevelops. It occurs in the case of: • &gt; 70% stenosis in both renal arteries • &gt; 50% stenosis with post stenotic dilatation The causes of renal artery stenosis are: • Atherosclerosis (most common) - common in older patients with cardiovascular risk factors • Fibromuscular dysplasia – more common in young, white females and is usually bilateral • Less common causes include: • Thromboemboli 775 \nSold by @itachibot • External compression by tumors • Systemic vasculitis • Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome • Transplant renal artery stenosis • Infrarenal aortic aneurysms and dissections The investigation of choice for renal artery stenosis is renal angiography.",

The most common peripheral (limb) arteries affected are the iliac \narteries. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a segmental, non-atheromatous, dysplastic type of angiopathy that \npredominantly affects females. The most common subtype is medial fibroplasia. It is one of the \nmajor causes of renovascular hypertension. The most common sites of involvement in decreasing \norder of frequency are as follows: • Renal arteries • Carotid arteries • Peripheral (limb) arteries - most commonly iliac arteries On angiography, a string of beads appearance is seen as shown below.",

Most clinical atheroembolic events follow angiographic procedures, \noften of the coronary vessels. It is associated with aortic aneurysms and renal artery stenosis. Systemic embolic manifestations \nsuch as fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss are also present, although cutaneous \nmanifestations are more common like livedo reticularis and localized toe gangrene. The lab findings include: • Rising serum creatinine • Transient eosinophilia • Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate • Hypocomplementemia Definitive diagnosis depends on kidney biopsy which demonstrates microvessel occlusion with \ncholesterol crystals that leave a cleft in the vessel as shown below.",

Renal intra-arterial angiography is the \ngold standard for diagnosis.In a patient with hypertension and increased creatinine, \nan ultrasound of the abdomen must be performed first to visualize the renal size and morphology \nto look for a unilateral shrunken kidney and thereby renal artery stenosis. Option A: MR angiography is less preferred as gadolinium contrast can lead to nephrogenic \nfibrosis, particularly in patients with reduced kidney function. Option C: CT scan with image reconstruction provides an excellent image but also carries a risk of \ncontrast nephropathy. Option D: Renal arterial doppler ultrasound measures renal artery velocities and can predict \nhemodynamically important lesions. However, it is not the gold standard test.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors must be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). In renal artery stenosis, blood flow to the kidney is reduced, thereby reducing blood flow to the \nafferent arterioles. Hence, constriction of efferent arterioles is needed to maintain hydrostatic \npressure within the glomerulus in order to maintain GFR. ACEIs and ARBs inhibit efferent renal arteriolar vasoconstriction. In bilateral RAS, this causes a \ndecline in the GFR within a few days of starting the drug. Note: Bilateral renal artery stenosis has been classically considered as an absolute \ncontraindication to the use of ACE inhibitors. However, new studies show that they may be used \nin some cases with careful monitoring. 778 \nSold by @itachibot Diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders",
