      "question": "Question 1: A patient with a history of frequent exacerbations of COPD is undergoing right heart \ncatheterization for evaluation of pulmonary artery pressure. What is the mean pulmonary \narterial pressure above which the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension can be made?",
      "options": {
        "a": "&gt;20 mmHg",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary hypertension is a pathological hemodynamic condition characterized by a mean \npulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt;20mmHg assessed by right heart catheterization. Pulmonary hypertension could be a complication of cardiac or pulmonary disease or a primary \ndisorder of small pulmonary arteries. Right heart catheterization is the gold standard \ninvestigation in diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. Note: The threshold for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension has been revised from &gt;25 mmHg \nto &gt;20 mmHg to enable earlier detection.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) mutation is the most commonly implicated gene \nin hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The BMPR2 receptor is involved in the regulation of growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of \npulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Due to the mutation, there is enhanced \nproliferation and reduced apoptosis of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells leading to \npulmonary hypertension.",

      "question": "Question 5: Echocardiography was done for a patient who presented with severe exertional dyspnea, chest \npain, and occasional fainting spells. It revealed a mitral valve area of 1 sq cm, elevated LA \npressure, and significant RV hypertrophy with TR. Which is the next best step in the \nevaluation of this patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, a mitral valve area of 1 sq cm suggests severe mitral stenosis. This leads to \nelevated LA pressure and subsequently pulmonary hypertension. Due to pulmonary hypertension, \nthere is compensatory RV hypertrophy (right ventricular-pulmonary hypertension coupling) and \nsecondary TR. The next step should be to confirm pulmonary hypertension. Right heart \ncatheterization is the gold standard test for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. Option A: Cardiac MRI is considered the gold standard for assessing RV function. In the case of \npulmonary hypertension, it is used for serial follow-ups due to its non-invasive nature. Options B and D: CT angiography and ventilation/perfusion scan are done when pulmonary \nhypertension is suspected to be due to pulmonary embolism, coagulation disorders, or past \nhistory of thrombosis (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) which should be \nfollowed by right heart catheterization.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Vasodilator \ntherapy would be beneficial in this patient. Endothelin receptor antagonists, PDE-5 inhibitors, \nand prostacyclins are examples of vasodilators. Option A: Since pulmonary arterial hypertension is a vascular disorder, bronchodilation is not \nbeneficial. Option C: Nitric oxide is a vasodilator and inhibitors of nitric oxide would worsen the disease in \npulmonary arterial hypertension.
