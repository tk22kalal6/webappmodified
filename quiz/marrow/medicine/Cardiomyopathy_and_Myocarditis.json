Mitral regurgitation with posteriorly directed regurgitant jet is usually \nseen on echocardiogram in HCM. ECG and echocardiogram are used to confirm the diagnosis of \nHCM. HCM is characterized by myofiber disarray in the heart, resulting in a hypertrophic myocardium. \nThe hypertrophy leads to the following pathophysiological changes in HCM: • Diastolic dysfunction - presenting as exercise intolerance • Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve • The hypertrophied muscles result in a narrow outflow tract • This leads to the production of a high-velocity jet pulling the mitral leaflets towards the septum \nposteriorly • SAM leads to mitral regurgitation • Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction Echocardiography features of HCM are as follows: 981 \nSold by @itachibot • Left ventricular wall thickness &gt;15 mm • Hypertrophied heart more confined to the interventricular septum resulting in banana-shaped \nventricular cavity",

In HCM left ventricular size is small, thus the approximation of the interventricular septum with \nthe mitral valve increases. The following mechanisms further increase this approximation and \nincrease blood outflow obstruction and intensity of murmur: • A decrease in left ventricular cavity volume or pressure (decreased preload) • A decrease in systemic vascular resistance and/or arterial pressure (decreased afterload) • Increase in left ventricular contractility The image below shows a cross-section of a heart with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of sudden heart failure in a previously healthy person under a stressful \nsituation is suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also called broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, or \nstress-induced cardiomyopathy. It is a transient myocardial stunning from microcirculation spams \ndue to a catecholamine surge during stress. It is usually seen in middle-aged women. The patients \ncan present with pulmonary edema, hypotension, and chest pain. ECHO reveals apical dilatation with basal hypercontraction of the heart, resembling a Takotsubo \n(pot for catching octopus). The ECG changes can mimic myocardial infarction but changes extend \nbeyond a particular coronary arterial territory. Coronary angiography, therefore, may be needed \nto rule out coronary occlusion. (Option B) It is a self-limiting disorder resolving within days to weeks. The prognosis is generally good. The image below shows left ventriculography during systole showing apical ballooning resembling \na Takotsubo pot. 985 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Infective cardiomyopathy: The most common causes of infective myocarditis are viral \ninfections and the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is associated with Chagas' disease. Acute \nviral myocarditis often presents with symptoms and signs of heart failure, although it can also \nmanifest as chest pain and show electrocardiogram (ECG) changes resembling pericarditis or \nacute myocardial infarction. In Chagas' disease, specific features include abnormalities in the \nconduction system, particularly dysfunction of the sinus node and AV node, as well as the right \nbundle branch block. Option C: Dilated cardiomyopathy: It is the most common cardiomyopathy and is predominantly \ncharacterised by systolic dysfunction. Though it may present acutely, it progresses chronically. \nThe familial form is due to mutations in TTN gene which encode the sarcomeric protein titin. \nOther etiologocal agents include alcohol, infective myocarditis, doxorubicin, hemochromatosis \nand sarcoidosis. Option D: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most \ncommon genetic cardiovascular disorder and is a prominent cause of sudden death before the age \nof 35 years. Family history is commonly present, a sarcomere mutation is present in ~50% of \npatients. Sudden death can be due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Risk factors \nfor sudden death in this disease include young age, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, failure \nof blood pressure to increase during exercise, recent (within 6 months) syncope, ventricular wall \nthickness &gt;3 cm, and possibly the severity of LV outflow obstruction.",

      "explanation": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the probable diagnosis when the observed myocardial stunning \npattern does not match ECG changes. Myocardial stunning is a state where certain segments of the myocardium (usually corresponding \nto an area of major coronary occlusion) show forms of contractile abnormality (dysfunction) on \nechocardiography. 986 \nSold by @itachibot In Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, while the ECG changes mimic a myocardial infarction(MI), the left \nventricular dysfunction extends well beyond the distribution of a specific coronary artery. Thus, \nthe myocardial stunning pattern might not fully match the ECG. Ventriculography shows apical \ndilation with basal contraction. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs typically in older women and is associated with a sudden \nincrease in emotional or physical stress, presenting with hypotension, chest pain with ECG \nchanges of acute MI, and pulmonary edema. Its also known as apical ballooning syndrome or \nacute stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Option B: Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction with reduced \ncontractility and ejection fraction, most commonly seen in amyloidosis, and enlarged ventricles on \nimaging with low-voltage ECG complexes. Option C: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a type of familial dilated \ncardiomyopathy (DCM), having defects in desmosomal proteins, affecting the ventricles showing \nthin ventricular walls on Echo, epsilon waves, and low voltage ECG complexes.
