      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Urine samples should be analyzed within 2-4 hours after collection to avoid cell lysis and \nprecipitation of solutes. If urine analysis is not possible in the given time, then the sample can be \nstored at 4-8 oC for a maximum of 12 hours. Urine samples can be collected using the following techniques: • Midstream sample during spontaneous voiding • Fresh specimen from an indwelling catheter • Suprapubic needle aspiration of the bladder, especially in infants",

      "explanation": "Isosthenuria is defined as a urine specific gravity of 1.010, which is similar to that of plasma. The \nnormal specific gravity of urine is around 1.020 to 1.030. Specific gravity and osmolality are measures of the concentration or relative density of urine. • Specific gravity: The weight of a solution relative to that of equal amounts of water. It is \nmeasured by refractometry or using reagent strips. • Osmolality: The gold standard for relative density. It is defined as the number of osmoles of \nsolute per kilogram of solvent. It is measured directly with an osmometer. Isosthenuria means that the kidney is neither concentrating nor diluting the urine. This is seen \nin chronic renal failure (CRF) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

A urine dipstick test is the first step to be done in a patient with high coloured urine to help \nidentify true hematuria. A positive dipstick test identifies heme that is present in red blood cells, \nhaemoglobin or myoglobin. A negative dipstick test implies that the reddish discolouration is due \nto pigments from certain food items (beetroot), drugs or porphyrias.",

      "explanation": "Non-glomerular proteinuria is characterized by the presence of N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG). This form of proteinuria occurs as a result of tubular injury. N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) is a \nlysosomal enzyme present in the proximal tubular cells and is released into the urine following \nany injury to the tubules. ˜ow-molecular-weight proteins such as 2-microglobulin are normally reabsorbed in the PCT. \nWhen there is tubular injury, the proportion of these proteins in urine increases. This lowers the \nalbumin: 2-microglobulin ratio in urine. In glomerular proteinuria, there is increased filtration of macromolecules like albumin across the \nglomerular capillary wall.
