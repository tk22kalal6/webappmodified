Symptoms of infective endocarditis can be broadly divided into cardiac and non-cardiac \nmanifestations. Non-cardiac manifestations of infective endocarditis are further divided into \nimmunologic and vascular phenomena. • Cardiac manifestations of IE: • Presence of new regurgitant murmurs • Congestive heart failure due to valve dysfunction • Perivalvular abscesses and intracardiac fistulae- caused due to the extension of infection beyond \nthe valves and into the adjacent myocardial tissue • Conduction system defects- due to the damage of the interventricular septum by the abscess. • Embolization of coronary arteries • Non-cardiac manifestations of IE: • Immunological phenomena (mnemonic ROGeR): • Osler's nodes- small, tender, red papules that are present on the distal finger and toe pads. • Roth's spots- white-centered retinal hemorrhages • Immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis • Positivity for rheumatoid factor • Vascular phenomena: 917 \nSold by @itachibot • Janeway lesions- these are faint, red, macular, painless lesions, commonly present on the thenar \nand hypothenar eminences. • Major arterial emboli • Septic pulmonary infarct • Mycotic aneurysm • Intracranial hemorrhages • Conjunctival hemorrhages • Splenic abscess • Cerebral abscess The image below shows Roth spot on the retina.",

Erythema marginatum is a pink, non-pruritic rash that generally occurs on the upper part of the \narms or trunk but not on the face. It extends from the centre with an irregular serpiginous border. \nAs the size of the rash increases, the center of the rash returns to normal, while the borders \nremain pink.

Mitral regurgitation is the most common cardiac lesion in ARF, while mitral stenosis is the most \ncommon lesion in rheumatic heart disease.
