      "explanation": "Cushing’s disease, and all other causes of Cushing's syndrome, can result in a \nhypercoagulable state. This is due to an increase in procoagulant factors and inhibition of \nfibrinolysis. Cushing's disease is a form of Cushing's syndrome caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor. \nThe high ACTH levels stimulate melanocytes and cause skin hyperpigmentation. This is especially \nseen over friction-prone areas like knuckles and elbows. The majority of patients with Cushing's syndrome have psychiatric symptoms such as: • Anxiety, • Depression, and • Frank psychosis Mineralocorticoid action of cortisol may lead to diastolic hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema.",

Plasma ACTH &gt; 15pg/ml is suggestive of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary \nor ectopic sources. Basal ACTH in pituitary adenoma can be normal or elevated, whereas in an \nectopic source the ACTH production is very high. This occurs because a pituitary adenoma retains \nsome sensitivity to the negative feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol, but ectopic tumors \nremain unaffected. Plasma ACTH &lt; 5pg/ml is suggestive of ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome that can be \ncaused by an adrenal adenoma or exogenous administration of glucocorticoids.",

The investigation \nof choice for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is MRI brain, to look for the presence of \na pituitary tumour. If the MRI brain shows a mass it is suggestive of a pituitary mass of &gt;6 mm in size. However, if \nthe MRI brain does not show a mass it suggests a pituitary tumor of &lt;6mm in size or an ectopic \nACTH source. Note: High-dose dexamethasone suppression test and CRH stimulation test are employed to \ndifferentiate pituitary from ectopic ACTH syndrome.

      "explanation": "Nelson’s syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is a \nprocedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary \nadenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases \nCRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the \noriginal pituitary tumor or the formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: • Hyperpigmentation • Excessive ACTH secretion • Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain is performed at regular \nintervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The \nprimary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid \nreplacement, as they do not produce cortisol. The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the need \nfor bilateral adrenalectomy these days. Option A: Sheehan’s syndrome refers to postpartum hypopituitarism that is caused by ischemic \nnecrosis of the anterior pituitary as a result of severe postpartum hemorrhage.
