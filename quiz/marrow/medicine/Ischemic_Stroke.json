      "explanation": "A decrease in the cerebral blood flow below 20 mL/100 g/min causes reversible ischemia. If this state is prolonged for several hours to days, it can lead to infarction. A decrease in CBF to 0 \ncauses the death of the brain tissue within 4–10 min. Normal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in an adult brain at rest is 50–55 mL/100 g/min.",

      "explanation": "This patient with mitral stenosis and acute onset weakness of the left arm is most likely to have \nhad an embolic stroke, which is a type of ischemic stroke. Embolic strokes tend to occur suddenly \nwith maximum neurologic deficit present at onset. Mitral stenosis is known to cause atrial fibrillation and is a common cause of cardioembolic \nstroke. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary, focal neurological deficit of sudden onset \n(stroke-like symptoms) lasting for less than 24 hours. This occurs due to focal ischemia of the \nbrain, retina or cochlea. Most TIAs last for less than 1 hour to a few minutes. There is a high risk of developing an ischemic stroke after a TIA, especially for the first 3 months \nfollowing a TIA.",

        "c": "Fever",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Neglect is a feature of stroke that need not be treated. Although neglect indicates a poor \nprognosis, most patients recover without any treatment in 1-6 months. Dysphagia(Option A) poses a high risk of aspiration and hence can't be left untreated. \nSpasticity(Option B) can be treated with baclofen, tizanidine. Untreated, it creates a psychosocial \nimpact on the patient. Fever(Option C) is deleterious in stroke patients and must be treated. Neglect can arise from injury to cortical-limbic-reticular network, that directs attention and \nintegrates the localization and identification of a stimulus. Neglect is associated with poor scores \nand slower recovery, but severe neglect is rare beyond 6 months. Recovery is rapid in the first 2 \nweeks, regardless of the side of stroke. By 3 months, patients might have some residual visual \nneglect. The choice of an intervention depends on the mechanism of neglect, the patient can be \ntreated for an underaroused right hemisphere which has difficulty processing sensory inputs. Neurogenic dysphagia is an important cause of pulmonary infection in any patient with stroke, \nmotor neuron disease, even transient dysphagia can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration \npneumonia, and airway obstruction with asphyxia, it increases the risk of death and \ninstitutionalization. Early placement of nasogastric tube to feed patients after stroke has \nimproved nutrition and reduced deaths. Spasticity is seen in less than 20% of stroke patients. Patients with bilateral weakness from \nhypoxic injury are likely to have signs of spasticity. Exaggerated cutaneous and autonomic reflexes \nand involuntary spasms are disabling problems associated with spasticity. Physical modalities like \nslow stretching movements and daily passive exercises will reduce symptoms of spasticity and risk \nof contractures. Baclofen, tizanidine, and clonidine are used in reducing clonus and extensor \nspasms.",

The below image shows the MR angiography findings in a patient with Moyamoya disease. 1108 \nSold by @itachibot Note: As this is a chronic condition, the lenticulostriate arteries develop a rich collateral \ncirculation around the occlusive lesion.
