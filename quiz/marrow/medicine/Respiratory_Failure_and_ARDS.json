      "question": "Question 2: A 45-year-old man underwent emergency surgery following a road traffic accident. The \nsurgery was performed under general anesthesia. Two days later, he developed features of \nrespiratory failure. Which of the following types is likely to be present in him?",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The features of respiratory failure in the perioperative period of this patient is most likely due to \nlung atelectasis. Type 3 respiratory failure is most likely to be present in him. Type 3 respiratory failure is also known as perioperative respiratory failure. After general anesthesia, there is a decrease in functional residual capacity due to a reduction in \nmuscular tone. This leads to airway closure and the collapse of the dependent lung units. Atelectasis can be treated by frequent changes in position, chest physiotherapy, upright \npositioning, and control of incisional and abdominal pain. Non-invasive positive-pressure \nventilation may also be used to reverse regional atelectasis.",

Which of the \nfollowing statements is false?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Up to 40% of cardiac output may be distributed to the respiratory muscles",

        "d": "Batwing appearance can be expected on an x-ray"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cardiogenic shock. He is likely to develop type 4 \nrespiratory failure, not type 2. Patients in cardiogenic shock often have respiratory distress secondary to acute pulmonary edema \n(batwing appearance on x-ray). This increases the requirement of oxygen delivery to the \nrespiratory muscles from &lt;5% to up to 40% of cardiac output. Hypoperfusion and increased oxygen requirement lead to inadequate perfusion of respiratory \nmuscles which causes type 4 respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are the treatment of choice.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the chest X-ray finding is suggestive of ARDS (acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome) secondary to acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis gives rise to \ninflammatory processes and endothelial damage that results in ARDS. CXR features in ARDS: • Early findings - normal or diffuse alveolar opacities (consolidation), bilateral and which obscure \nthe pulmonary vascular markings • Late findings - these opacities progress to more extensive consolidation that is diffuse Clinical disorders commonly associated with ARDS: • Direct lung injury: • Pneumonia • Aspiration of gastric contents • Pulmonary contusion 663 \nSold by @itachibot • Near-drowning • Toxic inhalation injury • Indirect lung injury: • Sepsis • Severe trauma- multiple fractures, flail chest, head trauma, burns • Multiple transfusions • Drug overdose • Pancreatitis • Post-cardiopulmonary bypass",

Diagnostic criteria in ARDS—Berlin definition:(requires each of the following criteria to be \npresent to diagnose ARDS) • Onset - Acute: Respiratory symptoms must have begun &lt; 1 week of a known clinical insult • Bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates: on a chest X-ray image or CT scan • Respiratory failure must not be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. Objective \nassessment e.g Echo should be done in cases of no known cause. • Impairment of oxygenation: The severity of hypoxemia defines the severity of ARDS.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of ARDS secondary to drowning. The ventilator setting \nrecommended is low tidal volume and high PEEP. Drowning causes direct lung injury. The aspiration of water into the lungs damages the surfactant. \nThis disrupts the alveolar-capillary membrane and leads to alveolar edema, resulting in ARDS. The ventilator settings recommended in ARDS are: • Low tidal volume: To avoid barotrauma due to overdistention of the alveoli. • High PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure): This prevents the collapse of alveoli at the end of \nthe expiration and improves oxygenation. 666 \nSold by @itachibot Neoplasms of the Lung",
