      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes recurrent hemolysis in a patient with hereditary \nspherocytosis leading to jaundice. In hemolytic conditions, only the unconjugated/ indirect \nbilirubin is raised and conjugated/direct bilirubin remains normal i.e. &lt;15% of total bilirubin. Bilirubin is synthesized from heme which is released primarily from the breakdown of old RBCs. \nThis bilirubin is in its unconjugated form. It enters the circulation and reaches the liver. It is \nconverted to conjugated bilirubin which is then secreted into the biliary tree. Therefore, in a healthy person, most of the circulating bilirubin is unconjugated/indirect bilirubin. \nHence, the normal liver function tests show indirect bilirubin &gt;85% and direct/conjugated \nbilirubin &lt;15% of the total bilirubin. The normal bilirubin values are as follows: • Total bilirubin levels - 1 to 1.5 mg/dL 253 \nSold by @itachibot • Direct bilirubin - &lt;0.3 mg/dL",

Biliary atresia is a disorder characterised by destruction or absence of bile ducts in a newborn. It \nleads to obstruction to the flow of bile thereby causing leaking of conjugated bilirubin into the \ncirculation. Option B: Physiological jaundice of the newborn occurs due to immaturity of the newborn's liver. \nIt is not able to conjugate the excess bilirubin produced after birth. It leads to unconjugated \nhyperbilirubinemia. Option C: Breast milk may contain certain factors that inhibit the conjugation of bilirubin leading \nto unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option D: Hemolytic disease of the newborn causes excess production of bilirubin due to \nhemolysis leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with poor feeding and seizures is indicative of kernicterus. This \naccompanied with unconjugated hyperbilrubinemia is highly suggestive of Crigler-Najjar \nsyndrome type 1. No improvement in bilirubin levels following the administration of phenobarbital further supports \nthe diagnosis. 256 \nSold by @itachibot Crigler-Najjar syndrome is of two types with type 1 having absent/trace enzyme activity and type 2 \nhaving &lt;10% of the normal enzyme activity. Hence, type 1 is far more severe and leads to \nkernicterus and neurological damage. Type 2 may also lead to kernicterus occasionally. Kernicterus occurs because the unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and hence crosses the \nblood-brain barrier. Phenobarbital is an enzyme inducer. Its administration can be used to differentiate between type 1 \nand type 2 Crigler-Najjar. • Enzyme induction by phenobarbital leads to improved conjugation of bilirubin leading to a \nreduction in total bilirubin level in type 2 Crigler-Najjar syndrome. • No improvement is seen in type 1 as the enzyme activity is absent and therefore cannot be \ninduced.

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Chronic liver disease is associated with hypergammaglobulinemia. Chronic liver diseases with \nhypergammaglobulinemia include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and alcoholic \nliver disease. The liver produces all globulins except gamma globulin which are produced by B cells. In chronic \nliver diseases like liver cirrhosis, there is impaired reticuloendothelial function in hepatic \nsinusoids. Hence the liver fails to clear the bacterial antigens. This causes an increased production \nof gamma globulin.",

      "question": "Question 21: In which of the following patients planned for a liver biopsy, would you not be required to use \nthe transjugular approach?",
      "options": {
        "a": "AST : ALT &lt; 2",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Liver biopsy can be performed in a patient with splenomegaly via the percutaneous approach. When the percutaneous approach is not advisable, liver biopsy can be performed via the \ntransjugular approach. In this approach, a cannula is inserted via the jugular vein which is then \npassed into hepatic veins through which the biopsy sample is taken. Therefore, any bleeding \nresulting from the procedure will drain into the hepatic veins. Indications of transjugular liver biopsy: • Percutaneous approach contraindicated • Significant ascites • Prolonged INR • Coagulopathies • Difficulty in accessing the liver via the percutaneous route • Morbid obesity 262 \nSold by @itachibot Alcoholic Liver Diseases and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease",
