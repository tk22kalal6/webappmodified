      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and \nhyperphosphatemia in a patient with CKD. Sevelamer is the best initial treatment for this \npatient. It is a phosphate binder that reduces the absorption of phosphate from the \ngastrointestinal tract. Other phosphate binders that can be used include: • Calcium containing • Calcium acetate • Calcium carbonate • Non-calcium containing • Sevelamer • Lanthanum Calcitriol and cinacalcet are used to decrease PTH levels in secondary hyperparathyroidism. \nHowever, they also cause increased serum phosphate levels. Hence, they should not be given as \ninitial treatment in patients with hyperphosphatemia. Bisphosphonates like pamidronate are used in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to decreased \nerythropoietin production. Hence, human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) such as darbepoetin \nis the most appropriate treatment and is considered the mainstay. However, an optimal response to treatment with EPO occurs only when iron stores are adequate. \nHence, iron supplements (oral or IV) must be given first to ensure the effectiveness of EPO \ntherapy. Other treatment options for anemia in CKD are: • Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation • Blood transfusion - in severe anemia and failure to EPO therapy",
