      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Exposure to a high dose of ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor for developing chronic \nmyeloid leukemia (CML). This may be in the form of radiation therapy for malignancy or other \nconditions and nuclear accidents. It is dose-dependent and low-dose radiation exposure is not a \nrisk factor. There are no familial associations, infections, or toxins associated with the development of CML.",

        "d": "Balanced translocation between long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Philadelphia chromosome is a balanced translocation between the long arm of chromosomes 9 \nand 22. It is present in the majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In a balanced translocation, a part of one chromosome is shifted to another chromosome and vice \nversa. In this case, the ABL gene present in chromosome 9 is translocated next to the BCR gene \n(breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22. It leads to the formation of shortened \nchromosome 22, which has been named the Philadelphia chromosome after the place of \ndiscovery.",

      "explanation": "Splenomegaly is the most common physical examination finding in patients with chronic myeloid \nleukemia (CML). The majority of the patients with CML are asymptomatic. They are often incidentally diagnosed \nduring routine blood tests when they have elevated white blood cells count. In later stages, the \nfollowing clinical features develop: 1408 \nSold by @itachibot • Anemia - easy fatigability, exercise intolerance • Increased number of WBCs and platelets - hyperviscosity, leading to MI and stroke • Increased cell metabolism - night sweats, weight loss, and hyperuricemia (gout) • Splenomegaly - abdominal pain, early satiety • Hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, skin or subcutaneous lesions",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Myelocytes will be predominantly elevated in the peripheral smear of the patients with chronic \nmyeloid leukemia (CML). The clinical hallmark of CML is the uncontrolled production of mature and maturing \ngranulocytes. All of the stages of development of granulocytes can be noted on the peripheral \nsmear in varying numbers: • Myeloblast - large cells with a round or oval nucleus, cytoplasm is dark and has no granules • Myelocyte - nucleus is oval and is eccentrically placed. • Metamyelocyte - nucleus is like a kidney bean-shaped • Band forms - nucleus is in the shape of C or U. • Segmented neutrophils- nucleus has 2-5 lobes. All the cells except the myeloblast have a granular cytoplasm. Due to the varied appearance of the \ncells, it is called garden party appearance or college girl's appearance. 1409 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Ponatinib is effective in patients with CML with T315I mutations. It is a third-generation tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor. The T315I mutation in BCR-ABL clones is specifically resistant to therapy with imatinib, \ndasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib but is sensitive to the third-generation agent ponatinib. It is \nalso used in the treatment of accelerated and blast phases.",
