Acute liver failure is the rapid worsening of the liver function in patients without cirrhosis or any \npreexisting liver disease.

Hypoglycemia is seen in acute liver failure and not hyperglycemia. It occurs due to \nimpaired gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Features of acute hepatic failure are: • Hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema- There are increased levels of ammonia \n(neurotoxin) in the body as a result of decreased elimination by the liver. • Coagulopathy- There is a decrease in the synthesis of coagulation factors leading to the elevated \nprothrombin time and INR. • Increased risk of infections- It occurs as a result of decreased reticuloendothelial activity, \ndecreased synthesis of complements, acute phase reactants, etc. • Renal failure- This is more commonly seen in drug/toxin-induced hepatic failure. • Metabolic complications like hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, \nhypomagnesemia.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The false statement regarding liver transplantation is option D. Reduced-size liver transplantation \ninvolves the resection of a full-size liver to appropriately fit in the abdominal cavity of small \nadults/adolescents. It is reserved only for urgent transplantation. On the contrary, split LT \ninvolves dividing the whole donor liver into a left lateral segment (segments II and III) for a \npediatric patient and a right lobe (segments I, IV-VIII) for an adult patient. Option A: The required graft volume in a living donor transplant is measured by graft weight to \nrecipient weight ratio (GRWR) or ratio of graft volume (GV) to recipient standard liver volume \n(SLV). The ideal GRWR is &gt;0.8 % or GV/SLV is &gt; 35%. The remnant donor liver mass is kept \nat &gt;30% for safe regeneration. 311 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Domino liver transplant involves transplanting a liver from a donor with metabolic \ndisease (eg: familial amyloid polyneuropathy) to a recipient with end-stage liver disease (eg: \nhepatocellular carcinoma). The donor also receives an LT (healthy donor) and is prioritized over \nthe end-stage liver disease recipient. As a liver with metabolic diseases is structurally and \nfunctionally normal, it can prolong the recipient’s life by at least 15-20 years as they will not \ndevelop the metabolic disease immediately. Option C: Extended criteria donors/ECDs (liver grafts extracted from donors after circulatory \ndeath) and paired-exchange technique are used to decrease waitlist mortality. However, ECDs \nhave poor graft function due to prolonged hypoxia and are associated with higher infection \ntransmission and biliary complications.",
