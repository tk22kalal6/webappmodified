      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "118 \nSold by @itachibot In Graves' disease, the level of serum TSH is low, free T4 is high and serum T3 is high. In patients \nwith thyrotoxicosis, the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) at 24 hours is characteristically elevated. Grave’s disease is characterized by thyrotoxicosis caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins \n(TSIs) synthesized by lymphocytes in the thyroid gland, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Thyroid \nperoxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies are also seen. This results in excess \nproduction of free T3 and free T4 levels and in turn reduces serum TSH levels. RAIU is used to differentiate Grave’s from other thyroid disorders, here there is diffuse high \nuptake. Measurement of TRab and TPOs is also done to confirm the diagnosis if the diagnosis \nclinically is unclear.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The most common hormone pattern observed in sick euthyroid syndrome (SES) is a decrease in \ntotal and unbound T3 levels with normal levels of T4 and TSH. This pattern is called low T3 \nsyndrome. SES is caused by an acute severe illness in the absence of underlying thyroid disease. T4 to T3 \nconversion via peripheral deiodination is impaired leading to a fall in T3 corresponding to the \nseverity of illness. There is an adaptive increase in the level of reverse T3 (rT3). In very sick patients, there can be a dramatic fall in both total T4 and T3 levels. This pattern is \ncalled low T4 syndrome and is associated with a poor prognosis.",

      "explanation": "An elevated TSH value with low free T4 is suggestive of primary hypothyroidism (Option D). Option A: In subclinical hypothyroidism, free T4 levels remain normal despite elevated TSH. Option B: TSH is low in hyperthyroidism. 119 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: The diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism is made along with a deficiency of other \npituitary hormones. TSH levels may be low, normal, or slightly increased. The elevation in TSH \nlevels can be attributed to the secretion of immunoreactive but biologically inactive forms of TSH. \nTo confirm the diagnosis, it is essential to detect a low level of unbound T4. The diagnostic approach to hypothyroidism is given in the flowchart below:",

      "explanation": "The given image showing localized overactivity (increased uptake) in the left lobe of the thyroid \ni.e., hot nodule, with suppression of the remainder of the gland, is suggestive of a hypersecreting \nadenoma. Other options: Option B: The likelihood of malignancies like papillary Carcinoma thyroid is low (5%) in the case \nof a hot nodule. Option C: Graves disease shows diffusely increased uptake on a thyroid scan. Option D: Lateral aberrant thyroid presents with swelling of cervical lymph nodes and not \nthyroid. It is due to skip metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma to the ipsilateral cervical \nlymph nodes. The thyroid scan appearance in different conditions is shown in the image below: 120 \nSold by @itachibot Diagnostic isotope studies, such as 99mTc-pertechnetate and iodine-123, are becoming less \ncommon in thyroid imaging because some warm swellings (5%) which are actually malignant \ncould be mistaken as benign. Isotope scanning is most valuable when assessing a hyperthyroid \npatient presenting with a nodule or nodularity in the thyroid. It helps to identify overactivity in \nthe gland, which can differentiate between a toxic nodule that suppresses the rest of the gland and \na toxic multinodular goitre with multiple areas of increased uptake.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The patient in the given clinical scenario is in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil is \nused in the 1st trimester of gestation because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole. Carbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as • Aplasia cutis congenita • Choanal atresia • Treacheosopageal fistula • Fetal goiter However, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It \nis replaced with carbimazole or methimazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of the pregnancy. The lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation. This is to \nmaintain the maternal serum-free T4 level in the upper limit of the non-pregnant normal \nreference range.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of thyroid storm and propylthiouracil is the drug of choice in this \npatient.

PTU is administered in large doses (500–1000 mg loading dose and 250 mg every 4h) \nadministered orally / via nasogastric tube / per rectum.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of a non-toxic diffuse goitre. Surgery is rarely indicated in this \ncondition, except for cosmetic reasons, tracheal compression or obstruction of the thoracic inlet. It is sometimes called simple goitre - because of the absence of nodules, and colloid goitre \n- because of the presence of uniform follicles that are filled with colloid. It is most commonly \ncaused by iodine deficiency and is often termed endemic goitre. Most diffuse goitres are benign and asymptomatic. Examination reveals a symmetrically enlarged, \nnon-tender, generally soft gland without palpable nodules. TFTs should be performed in all \npatients to exclude thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. If markedly enlarged, it can cause tracheal/oesophagal compression. Substernal goitre may obstruct the thoracic inlet leading to a positive Pemberton’s sign i.e., facial \ncongestion on bilateral arm elevation due to venous occlusion. 122 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Glucocorticoid treatment is not indicated in silent thyroiditis. The condition is called silent thyroiditis, as it is painless. When it occurs 3-6 months after \npregnancy, it is termed postpartum thyroiditis. The condition is observed in up to 5% of women \nand it is 3 times more common in women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Typically, patients experience a brief phase of thyrotoxicosis lasting 2-4 weeks, followed by \nhypothyroidism for 4-12 weeks, and then clinical resolution. Often, only one phase is apparent. In addition to painless goitre, silent thyroiditis can be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a \nnormal ESR value and the presence of TPO antibodies. Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be managed with a brief course of propranolol, a 20–40 mg dose \nadministered three or four times daily. Thyroxine replacement may be needed for treating the hypothyroid phase but should be \nwithdrawn after 6–9 months, to enable patient recovery.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical effects of levothyroxine replacement are slow to appear. Patients may not experience \nfull relief from symptoms until 3–6 months after normal TSH levels are restored. If there is no residual function, the daily replacement dose of levothyroxine is usually 1.6 g/kg \nbody weight (typically 100–150 g), ideally taken at least 30 minutes before breakfast. TSH responses are gradual and should be determined 2 months following the initiation of \ntreatment or change in dose. Once the full replacement is achieved and TSH levels are stable, TSH \nmeasurement is recommended at annual intervals. In patients who have developed hypothyroidism following treatment of Graves' disease, lower \ndoses are needed for replacement. This is because there is often underlying autonomous function, \nnecessitating lower replacement doses (typically 75–125 g/d).",
