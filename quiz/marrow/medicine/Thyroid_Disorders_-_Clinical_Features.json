      "explanation": "Ophthalmopathy is the specific sign of Graves’ disease. Glycosaminoglycan deposition, lymphoid infiltrates and fatty infiltration are responsible for \nophthalmopathy and dermopathy. Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder due to the production of TSH-receptor stimulating \nimmunoglobulins (TSI) thereby causing hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the triad of: • Thyrotoxicosis • Infiltrative ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos) • Dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) 104 \nSold by @itachibot Ophthalmopathy can sometimes precede or follow thyrotoxicosis, accounting for some cases of \neuthyroid ophthalmopathy.",

      "explanation": "The given scenario along with the image is suggestive of thyroid dermopathy. It occurs in &lt;5% \nof patients with Graves’ disease. Thyroid dermopathy is almost always associated with \nophthalmopathy. Thyroid dermopathy is most frequently observed over the anterolateral parts of the lower leg. \nHence, it is termed pretibial myxedema. Skin changes can occur at other sites, particularly after \ntrauma. The typical lesion is a noninflamed, indurated plaque with a deep pink or purple color \nand orange peel-textured papules. Thyroid acropachy refers to a form of clubbing rarely observed in Graves’ disease. It is strongly \nassociated with thyroid dermopathy. Thyroid dermopathy usually does not need any active treatment, but if necessary, treatment \nincludes topical, high-potency glucocorticoid ointment under an occlusive dressing or octreotide \ncan be useful in some cases.

Sudden pain may occur due to haemorrhage. \nTFTs should be performed in all patients to exclude thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. The risk of malignancy due to MNG is similar to that due to solitary nodules. Hoarseness, \nreflecting the involvement of laryngeal nerves implicate malignancy. Most non-toxic MNGs can be managed conservatively. Levothyroxine if used, should be started at \nlow doses and then increased gradually.

      "explanation": "The presenting symptoms of lethargy, increased sleep, and weight gain are suggestive of \nhypothyroidism. An increase in TSH on administration of TRH confirms the lack of stimulus for \nTSH secretion from the hypothalamus. Although decreased TSH levels can be seen in hyperthyroidism, clinical features such as lethargy, \nincreased sleep and weight gain are not. This pushes the diagnosis in favor of hypothyroidism. If the disease was in the pituitary, there would be no increase in TSH secretion on administration \nof TRH (Option B). Normally, the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is released by the hypothalamus.

      "explanation": "The given clinical history is typical of a case of hypothyroidism and the diagnosis is myxedema \ncoma, which is a serious complication of hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma is a part of a larger clinical picture of myxedema crisis. Myxedema crisis refers to \nsevere, life-threatening manifestations of hypothyroidism. It is often precipitated by the \nadministration of sedatives, antidepressants, hypnotics, anaesthetics, or opioids. Clinical features of myxedema crisis : • Impaired cognition, ranging from confusion to somnolence to coma (myxedema coma). • Convulsions and abnormal CNS signs. • Profound hypothermia (can reach 23°C), hypoventilation, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, \nhypoxemia, hypercapnia, and hypotension. • Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury • A high mortality rate Other options: Option A: Without a history of or focus of infection, septic shock is unlikely.
