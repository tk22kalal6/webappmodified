      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Glucocorticoids are used during an exacerbation of COPD. They hasten recovery and reduce the \nchances of future exacerbations. Exacerbations are episodes of increased dyspnoea and cough, with a change in the amount and \ncharacter of sputum. They are often triggered by an infection with one-third of cases having a viral \netiology. They may or may not have other signs of illness such as fever, myalgias, and sore \nthroat. In severe cases, they may present with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Note: While oral glucocorticoids are contraindicated in long-term treatment due to side effects, \nthey are used for acute exacerbation of COPD. 591 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "options": {
        "a": "Non-Invasive PPV should be given",
        "b": "Invasive PPV should be given",
        "c": "IV corticosteroids should be administered",
        "d": "Permissive hypercapnia is allowed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) should be the first mode of ventilation used in \nCOPD patients with acute respiratory failure provided there are no absolute contraindications. \nThis approach improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, \ndecreases hospitalization duration and enhances overall survival outcomes. Invasive positive pressure ventilation is only considered after failure of NIPPV, resulting in severe \nrespiratory distress, life threatening hypoxemia, severe hypercarbia and/or acidosis, markedly \nimpaired mental status, respiratory arrest or hemodynamic instability (Option B). Apart from NIPPV, short-acting inhaled beta 2 agonists (albuterol, salbutamol) with or without \nshort-acting anticholinergics (ipratropium) and Long-acting anticholinergics (tiotropium) are \nrecommended as the initial bronchodilators. Maintenance therapy with long-acting beta 2 \nagonists (formoterol) must be started as soon as possible. Systemic corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD as they \nreduce airway inflammation and improve lung function over time. However, the effects are not \nimmediate. NIPPV on the other hand provides immediate relief to the patient and reduces the \nwork of breathing. Therefore, it would not be the best choice in this case. (Option C) Antibiotics can also be considered, as they reduce duration of hospitalisation. Treatment is given \nfor 5 days. Permissive hypercapnia refers to a ventilation strategy where tidal volume is reduced in order to \navoid hyperinflation-associated lung trauma. It is not preferred at the initial presentation. It is \nonly permitted once invasive PPV is started following NIPPV failure (Option D) An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and \nsputum that worsen over &lt; 14 days. Exacerbations of COPD are often associated with increased \nlocal and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insults to the \nlungs.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the ABG and X-ray findings is suggestive of acute \nexacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure. The best initial step of management is low-flow \nhumidified oxygen. Oxygen supplementation is a crucial component of acute therapy. Administering O2 should target \na SpO2- 88-92% or PaO2- 60-70 mmHg. This helps to minimize the risk of worsening \nhypercapnia with excess supplemental oxygen. The given ABG shows respiratory acidosis as PaCO2 &gt;45 mmHg, and pH&lt;7.35. In respiratory \nacidosis, a trial of non-invasive ventilation is given. Hence, low-flow humidified oxygen is the first \nstep in management. Option B: High flow oxygen causes dryness, crusting epistaxis, and damages the lung hence not \nused. Option C: Salbutamol and budesonide nebulization are not effective as initial management in \nexacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure. 592 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Methylxanthines are not recommended in the management of acute exacerbations due \nto their side effect profiles.",
