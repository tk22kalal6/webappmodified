      "question": "Question 1: A 38-year-old woman presented with chest pain that was unrelated to physical exertion. ECG \nshowed ST-segment elevation. Intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing revealed a \ntransient spasm of the right coronary artery. What is the drug of choice in this condition?",

        "a": "Dopamine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above scenario in which rest pain is associated with ST-segment elevation and transient \ncoronary vasospasm is suggestive of Prinzmetal's angina. The drug of choice is a calcium channel \nblocker. Prinzmetal variant angina (PVA) is a clinical syndrome in which chest pain occurs without the \nusual precipitating factors. It usually results from coronary vasoconstriction (vasospasm) and \ntends to involve the right coronary artery. It is a supply ischemia and usually causes transmural ischemia (subendocardial in classic angina \npectoris). It often affects women under 50 years of age. It characteristically occurs in the early morning, \nawakening patients from sleep, and may be associated with arrhythmias or conduction defects. The clinical diagnosis of PVA is made by the detection of transient ST-segment elevation with rest \npain. Coronary angiography demonstrates transient coronary spasm which is the diagnostic \nhallmark of PVA. Nitrates and calcium channel blockers both can be used in alleviating symptoms in Prinzmetal's \nangina. However due to the development of nitrate tolerance in some individuals, they are less \npreferred and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem are used as first-line agents.",

      "explanation": "Trimetazidine is an antianginal drug. It is a PFox (partial fatty acid oxidation) inhibitor. It inhibits the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and \nthus enhances glucose oxidation. This results in decreased oxygen consumption in ATP synthesis \nas beta-oxidation consumes more oxygen. Option A: Thyroxine increases the heart rate, which can increase the myocardial oxygen demand \nand can precipitate angina. Option B: Sumatriptan and other triptans cause coronary vasospasm.

      "explanation": "Verapamil and -blockers have additive effects on inhibiting SA node and AV conduction, the \ncombination should be avoided to prevent severe bradycardia and conduction block. These agents \ncan also have additive effects on decreasing left ventricular function which could seriously impair \ncardiac output in a patient with heart failure. Diltiazem can be combined with beta-blockers in patients with normal ventricular function and no \nconduction disturbances. Amlodipine and -blockers have complementary actions on coronary blood supply and myocardial \noxygen demands. Whereas the former decreases blood pressure and dilates coronary arteries, the \nlatter slows the heart rate and decreases contractility.",

      "question": "Question 21: A 50-year-old man started experiencing chest pain and was rushed to a primary care facility \nat 10 AM. A diagnosis of acute severe MI was made. Due to the unavailability of PCI, he was \ntaken to a tertiary center by 10:30 AM. By what time should PCI be performed in this patient \nat the latest?",
      "options": {
        "a": "11 AM",

        "d": "12:30 PM"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The door-to-balloon time for a patient arriving in a hospital that is not equipped to perform a PCI \nand is then transported to a hospital where PCI can be performed is 120 min. The door-to-balloon time is the time interval between the first medical contact and PCI. 973 \nSold by @itachibot It is 90 min or less for a patient arriving in a hospital equipped with PCI (ACC/AHA guidelines \nand MoHFW, India guidelines). In patients who cannot receive PCI within 120 min of first medical contact, fibrinolysis is given. \nFibrinolysis is only considered if the patient presents within 12 hours of symptom onset. Note: The European society of cardiology (ESC) recommends 60 min target time for patients \npresenting in a PCI-centre and 90 min maximum target time for PCI-mediated reperfusion.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Elevation of cTn &gt; 5 times normal in the absence of any other features",
        "b": "Elevation of cTn &gt; 5 times normal in the presence of symptoms of MI, ECG changes, ",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "PCI related MI is defined as elevation of cTn &gt; 5 times normal in the presence of symptoms of \nMI, ECG changes, angiographic findings or imaging abnormality. The imaging abnormality could be a new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion \nabnormality. If the baseline cTn values are elevated but stable or falling, a rise in cTn &gt;20 % \ndefined PCI related MI. CABG related MI is defined as elevation of cTn &gt; 10 times the normal baseline values in the \npresence of new pathologic Q waves, angiographic findings or imaging abnormality.",

      "question": "Question 23: A patient comes to the hospital with chest pain for the last 3 hours. Vitals are stable. ECG \nrevealed ST depression and T wave inversion in anterior chest leads. Which of the following \nwould be the most appropriate line of management in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Valsalva",
        "b": "Squatting",
        "c": "Standing posture",
        "d": "Exercise"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Based on the given clinical scenario of a patient presenting with sudden onset of chest pain, with \nECG findings of ST depression in the anterior chest leads and T wave inversion, the most likely \ndiagnosis is a non-ST-segment elevation-acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). The most \nappropriate line of management in this patient would be to administer aspirin with heparin. Percutaneous coronary intervention is indicated after coronary angiography in high-risk patients. Fibrinolytic therapy is not indicated in patients with NSTE-ACS. Arrhythmia prophylaxis is generally not routinely recommended in all patients with NSTE-ACS. Acute coronary syndrome is classified into 2 groups: • ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) • NSTE-ACS NSTE-ACS further includes: • NSTEMI (myocyte necrosis present and cardiac troponins elevated) • Unstable Angina (myocyte necrosis absent and cardiac troponins not elevated) The diagnosis of NSTE-ACS is based on the following: Severe chest discomfort with at least one of 3 features: • Occurring at rest or minimal exertion and lasting for more than 10 minutes • Recent onset • Crescendo pattern 974 \nSold by @itachibot ECG showing: • ST segment depression • T wave inversion Elevated cardiac troponins in case of NSTEMI. Management of NSTE-ACS: To provide relief of pain and discomfort, initial treatment includes bed rest, nitrates, beta \nblockers, and inhaled oxygen (only if arterial O2 saturation &lt;90%). Antithrombotic therapy consisting of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs: • Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): Aspirin (162-325 mg) AND one ADP receptor inhibitor \n(Ticagrelor, clopidogrel or prasugrel) • Anticoagulation: Enoxaparin, unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux or bivalirudin • An early invasive strategy including diagnostic coronary angiography (within 2–72 hours of \npresentation) followed by revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention/ coronary artery \nbypass grafting) is indicated for stabilized patients who are at high risk of coronary events (Based \non TIMI, GRACE or HEART score). 975 \nSold by @itachibot Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis",
