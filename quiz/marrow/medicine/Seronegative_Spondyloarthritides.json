It usually presents \nin the mid-twenties. It presents with lower back pain that improves with activity and worsens with rest or inactivity. \nEarly morning stiffness is a characteristic feature. It is associated with elevated serum IgA levels. \nNSAIDs are the first line of pharmacological therapy.
