      "explanation": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV patients, regardless of CD4 T \nlymphocyte cell count or clinical stage. This is done to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. A secondary \ngoal of ART is to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The 4th generation HIV test combines the detection of antibodies against HIV-1 &amp; HIV-2 \nwith detection of the core p24 antigen of HIV-1. Inclusion of p24 antigen capture allows detection \nof HIV-1 infection even before seroconversion i.e., presence of antibodies in the blood. The approximate time to positivity following infection is 15 to 20 days. Consequently, the window \nperiod between infection and detection of the infection is shortened. Fourth-generation HIV testing is highly sensitive (99.9%) and is the CDC-recommended initial \nscreening test for HIV. No further testing is required for specimens that are non-reactive on \nELISA screening.

It detects specific antibodies against multiple proteins of all 3 \nmajor HIV genes - gag, pol, and env. Persons with HIV-2 will often have an indeterminate western blot pattern showing the presence of \nGag bands and Pol bands, but an absence of Env bands. This pattern occurs because HIV-1 and \nHIV-2 share little similarity in the env gene. Moreover, the presence of gp36 points towards a \ndiagnosis of HIV-2.

      "explanation": "In a patient with HIV and TB start ATT first and then start ART as soon as ATT is tolerated \n(between 2 weeks and 2 months) by the patient. This is done in order to avoid immune \nreconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS): Patients with HIV-related TB may experience a temporary paradoxical exacerbation of symptoms \nand radiographic manifestations of TB after starting ATT. This occurs as a result of immune \nreconstitution due to simultaneous administration of ART and ATT. It is characterized by high fever, lymphadenopathy, expanding intra-thoracic lesions, and \nworsening of chest X-ray findings. Diagnosis should be made only after ruling out treatment \nfailure and other infections. For severe cases, prednisone 1-2mg/kg is used for 1-2 weeks and then \ngradually tapered. However, in patients with CD4 &lt;50/L, the benefits of administering ART immediately after \ninitiating ATT outweigh the risks of IRIS, and therefore ART should be started as early as \npossible. Note: As per RNTCP guidelines, CBNAAT is the preferred diagnostic technique for testing TB in \nPLHIV (people living with HIV). Smear microscopy has poor sensitivity in detecting TB in PLHIV \ndue to fewer organisms in sputum, and hence is not preferred.",

Antibody assays (e.g., ELISA) are not reliable in infants and young children because of the \npersistence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies.
