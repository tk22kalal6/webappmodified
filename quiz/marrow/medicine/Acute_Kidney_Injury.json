ACE inhibitors cause inhibition of efferent arteriole vasoconstriction, leading to reduced renal \nperfusion. Rhabdomyolysis causes AKI by both prerenal mechanisms (due to volume sequestration) and ATN \n(due to precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules). Nephrotoxins like myeloma light chains, snake venom, myoglobin (due to rhabdomyolysis) cause \nacute tubular necrosis (ATN). This leads to renal or intrinsic AKI. 721 \nSold by @itachibot",

The release of calcium phosphate from lysed cells contributes to \nhyperphosphatemia and subsequent reciprocal depression in serum calcium levels. The \nconsumption of ionized calcium during the formation of calcium phosphate crystals leads to \nhypocalcemia. TLS is commonly observed after initiation of chemotherapy in hematologic malignancies \ncharacterized by high cell turnover rates, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia. The destruction of neoplastic cells results in the release of nucleic acids, which are broken down \ninto uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. The acidic environment in the renal tubules can cause \nuric acid to precipitate, leading to acute renal failure. Potassium is released in large quantities \nduring tumor cell lysis leading to hyperkalemia. TLS is diagnosed using the Cairo-Bishop criteria which includes both laboratory and clinical \ncriteria. Prevention is the mainstay of the management of TLS, which involves includes allopurinol, which \ninhibits the production of uric acid, and aggressive hydration to promote urine flow. Urinary \nalkalization is not recommended. Febuxostat, a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, can be used \nas an alternative. In severe cases or when renal failure is present, rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is used \nfor treatment. Rasburicase rapidly lowers uric acid levels by converting it into a highly soluble \ncompound called allantoin. Renal replacement therapy is often required and should be considered \nin case of acute renal failure. 730 \nSold by @itachibot Renal Replacement Therapy",
