It can be due to: • Autoantibodies against GM-CSF (acquired/idiopathic/autoimmune PAP) • Mutation in GM-CSF receptors (hereditary PAP) • Secondary: There is a reduction in the number or ability of alveolar macrophages that causes \nimpaired surfactant clearance. It can be due to: • Silicosis • Immunodeficiency disorders • Hematopoietic disorders and malignancies 626 \nSold by @itachibot • Congenital: It affects neonates and children.

      "question": "Question 20: A 45-year-old man who has worked as a miner for the past 25 years, comes to the OPD with \ncomplaints of dyspnoea and cough. Pulmonary function tests and a lung biopsy are done. The \nhistopathology of the sample is shown below. Which type of emphysema can this condition 621 \nSold by @itachibot give rise to?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Cystic fibrosis",
        "b": "Tuberculosis",
        "c": "Amyloidosis",
        "d": "Lung abscess"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the microscopic image showing abundant black-colored pigment \nwithin the macrophages of lung parenchyma is characteristic of pulmonary anthracosis/coal \nworker's pneumoconiosis. It may give rise to centrilobular emphysema. The inhaled carbon particles are engulfed by the lung macrophages. They accumulate in the \nconnective tissue along lymphatics or in lymphoid tissue along the bronchi or the hilum, which \ncauses the blackening of the tissues. Aggregates of carbon dust are present as coal macules or \nnodules which consist of carbon-laden macrophages. It is commonly seen in people who work in environments where there is high air pollution with \ncarbon particles, such as coal mines. It is usually benign and less than 10% of the cases develop \nprogressive massive fibrosis which may lead to pulmonary dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, \nand cor pulmonale. Coal workers may also develop emphysema or chronic bronchitis, \nindependent of smoking. Unlike asbestosis, this condition does not predispose to cancer. 631 \nSold by @itachibot Bronchiectasis and Lung Abscess",
