However, there are certain diseases that impair patient survival and are not \naccounted for in the MELD score. Patients with these diseases are given upgraded MELD points \nto accurately represent the mortality risk and these conditions are called MELD exceptions. The MELD exceptions include:- • Portopulmonary hypertension • Hepatocellular carcinoma • Familial amyloid polyneuropathy • Primary hyperoxaluria (necessitating liver-kidney transplantation) • Cystic fibrosis with liver disease • Highly selected cases of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. • Hepatopulmonary syndrome • Hepatic artery thrombosis 7–14 days post-liver transplantation. 348 \nSold by @itachibot",
