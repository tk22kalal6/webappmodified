      "explanation": "129 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario along with elevated serum C peptide levels points towards a diagnosis \nof insulinoma in a MEN1 patient. The definitive treatment of choice in this patient is surgery. Insulinoma is the second most common functioning enteropancreatic tumor in MEN1 syndrome. \nInvestigation of choice is 72-hour fasting glucose and serum insulin levels. These parameters are \nmeasured when the patient develops hypoglycemic symptoms during a supervised 72-hour fasting \nperiod. The treatment of choice is surgery, ranging from enucleation of a single tumor to pancreatectomy. Non-surgical management of insulinoma includes frequent consumption of carbohydrate-rich \nmeals, octreotide or diazoxide, which are not always successful. Selpercatinib, a kinase inhibitor was recently approved by the FDA. It is used to treat tumours \nwith a mutation in the RET gene. These are non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, \nand other types of thyroid cancers in patients with a mutation in the RET gene.",
