      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The left anterior descending (anterior interventricular) coronary artery is most commonly \ninvolved in coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease. The regions affected are the anterior wall of the left ventricle near the apex and the anterior \nportion of the ventricular septum. CAD is caused by plaque buildup in the walls of the coronary arteries that narrow over time and \ncan partially or totally block the blood flow causing myocardial ischemia and subsequently \ninfarction.

This results in the \nsubendocardium being the least perfused region making it most vulnerable to ischemic damage. A narrow zone of the myocardium immediately beneath the endocardium is spared from necrosis \nbecause it can be oxygenated by diffusion from the ventricle. 947 \nSold by @itachibot",

The ECG pattern of Wellens syndrome is relatively common in \npatients who exhibit symptoms consistent with unstable angina. ECG in the pain-free interval is characterized by deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in precordial \nleads and with minimal or no ST elevations. Cardiac enzymes are normal or mildly elevated.

The cardiac troponins are particularly valuable when there is clinical suspicion of a small MI that \nmay be below the detection limit for CK-MB measurement. They have replaced CK-MB as the \nbiomarker of choice for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponins: • Most specific cardiac biomarker for myocardial injury/acute MI • Elevations are useful for short &amp; long-term prognoses in MI • Elevations correlate with the estimation of infarct size and risk of death • Newer highly sensitive assays for troponins become positive within the first 3 hours after onset \nof chest pain in MI",

      "explanation": "Measurement of troponin is the best investigation to diagnose MI within 2-4 hours. 955 \nSold by @itachibot Troponin T/I: • Highly specific for MI • Troponin I is more important than troponin T. • Troponins will remain elevated longer than creatine kinase (CK), for up to 14 days. • This makes troponins a superior marker for diagnosing MI in the recent past (late diagnosis). • Reinfarction: It is now clear that cardiac troponin (cTn) increases rapidly, even if it is from an \nabnormal baseline in patients with reinfarction. • Sometimes cTn concentration is elevated, but stable or decreasing at the time of suspected \nreinfarction. In this case, the diagnosis of reinfarction requires a 20% or greater increase in the \ncTn measurement Creatine kinase (CK): • Less sensitive and specific than troponins • When cTn is available, CK-MB should not be used for the initial diagnosis of acute MI Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): • Normally, LDH2&gt;LDH1; but, in MI, LDH1&gt;LDH2. This is called flipping of the LDH ratio. • Current recommendations suggest that LDH no longer has a role in the diagnosis of MI. Myoglobin: • Earliest enzyme to increase after MI. • Not specific to cardiac muscle and can be elevated to any form of injury to skeletal muscle. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), which mainly exists in cardiomyocytes, has \nrecently emerged as a potential biomarker, which was found to be sensitive for the early diagnosis \nof acute myocardial infarction. H-FABP as an early marker and cTnI as a late marker would be the \nideal combination to cover the complete diagnostic window for AMI 956 \nSold by @itachibot",
