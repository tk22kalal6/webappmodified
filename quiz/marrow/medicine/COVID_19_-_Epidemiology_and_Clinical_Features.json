      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Coronaviruses are enveloped helically symmetrical viruses. Being enveloped contributes to their lipid solvent susceptibility. This is the reason alcohol-based \nhand sanitizers and soaps are used. The lipid membrane dissolution and protein denaturation by \nethanol lead to membrane disruption and inhibition of metabolism. The coronaviridiae have a single unsegmented ss (+) RNA, which is the largest genome among \nRNA viruses. They are about 120- 160 nm in size and contain a helical nucleocapsid. A total of \nseven human coronaviruses have been identified: The image given below shows the coronavirus. 1512 \nSold by @itachibot Name \nIllness COVID-19 SARS-C \noV-2 SARS-C \noV Severe acute respiratory synd \nrome (SARS) MERS- \nCoV Middle East respiratory synd \nrome (MERS) HCoV-N \nL63 Usually mild respiratory illne \nss HCoV-2 \n29E HCoV-O \nC43 HKU1",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette showing breathlessness, fever, and cough with a low oxygen saturation \nand ground-glass opacities on HRCT is indicative of COVID-19 caused by \nthe SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is the specific functional \nreceptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells. ACE2 is expressed in nearly all human organs in varying degrees. In the respiratory system, ACE2 \nis mainly expressed by the type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the highest quantity. Hence, the \nprimary target of SARS-CoV-2 is type 2 alveolar cells. The functional receptor for SARS-CoV (SARS 2002) is also ACE 2. Note: Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 is the functional receptor for MERS-CoV (MERS 2012). 1513 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Spike protein (marked as 1 in the image) determines the infectious nature and host specificity of \nSARS-CoV-2. The spike protein also referred to as the CoV S protein is one of the key components determining \nvirus virulence, tissue tropism, and host range. The coronavirus spike protein mediates \ncoronavirus entry into host cells. Each spike protein has two distinct subunits S1 and S2. • S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the specific receptor (ACE 2) on the host cell surface \nfacilitating viral attachment to the surface of target cells. • S2 subunit drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The host protease enzymes, mainly transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2) cleave the \nspike protein. This activates the spike protein to induce virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell \nsurface and allows the entry of coronaviruses into the host cell.",
