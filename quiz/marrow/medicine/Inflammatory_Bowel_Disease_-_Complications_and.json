      "explanation": "The given image shows pyoderma gangrenosum. It is very difficult to treat and often requires IV \nantibiotics and IV glucocorticoids. Other drugs used in its management include dapsone, \ncyclosporine, and infliximab. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a dermatological extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel \ndisease. It begins as a pustule and progresses to an ulcer with necrotic tissue and exudates. It may \noccur years before the onset of bowel symptoms and is usually associated with severe disease. Lesions are commonly found on the dorsal surface of the feet and legs but may occur on the arms, \nchest, and even the face. It responds poorly to colectomy and may even develop years after the \nsurgery. Other dermatological manifestations associated with IBD include: • Erythema nodosum • Sweet syndrome (neutrophilic dermatosis) • Perianal skin tags • Psoriasis • Metastatic Crohn's disease (cutaneous granulomas).",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given urinary crystal is the bipyramidal or envelope-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate \ndihydrate. Calcium oxalate stones are more commonly associated with Crohn's disease. In Crohn's disease (especially post small bowel resection), fatty acids are not absorbed because of \nileal dysfunction. These fatty acids in the gut lumen bind to calcium. Because of this, the dietary \noxalates which normally bind to the calcium are now left unbound. This leads to increased \nabsorption of dietary oxalates leading to hyperoxaluria and oxalate stones. Note: Celiac disease is also associated with calcium oxalate stones.",

PSC is more common in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Additionally, recurrent episodes of bloody diarrhea with weight loss seen in this patient also point \ntoward a possible diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD characterized by \nintrahepatic and extrahepatic duct inflammation/fibrosis. Around 50-75% of patients with \nprimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whereas, only 5% of \nIBD cases develop PSC. Option A: Chronic pancreatitis is associated with a chain of lakes appearance- dilated main duct \nwith clubbing and dilatation of the side branches. Patients can present with steatorrhoea i.e., the \npassage of offensive-smelling large stools due to fat malabsorption. The image below shows chain of lakes appearance on MRI: Option B: Celiac disease may be associated with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), rather than \nprimary sclerosing cholangitis.",
