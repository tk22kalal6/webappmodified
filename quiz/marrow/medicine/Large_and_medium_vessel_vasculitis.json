The best investigation for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is temporal \nartery biopsy. Histopathology shows panarteritis with the presence of mononuclear cells and giant cells. The \nbiopsy may not be positive in all patients due to patchy histologic findings. Since involvement of \nthe vessel may be segmental, positive yield is increased by obtaining a biopsy segment of 3–5 cm \ntogether with serial sectioning of biopsy specimens. Note : According to the 21st edition of Harrison's Medicine, as involvement of the vessel may be \nsegmental, getting a biopsy segment of 3–5 cm together with serial sectioning of biopsy specimens \nwould help to increase a positive yield. And Robbin's 10th edition mentions that an adequate \nbiopsy requires at least a 1-cm segment.",

Generalized symptoms like fever, night sweats, \nweight loss, malaise, arthralgias, and anorexia may occur long before vascular symptoms. Vascular symptoms depend on the vessel involved: • Arch of the aorta and its branches: • Subclavian artery (most commonly affected) - It leads to weak pulses in the upper extremities. \nHence, it is also known as pulseless disease. It may also lead to Raynaud’s phenomenon. • Carotid arteries- It leads to weak pulses, blindness, and neurological deficits. • Aortic arch- It may lead to congestive heart failure. 456 \nSold by @itachibot • Abdominal aorta, celiac axis, and superior mesenteric artery - leads to abdominal pain, nausea, \nand vomiting • Iliac vessels - leads to claudication of the legs • Renal arteries - leads to systemic hypertension • Pulmonary artery - leads to pulmonary hypertension • Coronary arteries (least commonly affected) - lead to myocardial infarction Investigations: • Laboratory tests reveal an elevated ESR level, anemia, and elevated immunoglobulin levels. • Arteriography is done as a confirmatory test. Treatment includes glucocorticoid therapy, methotrexate, immunotherapy with anti-TNF agents, \nand surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "One-third of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) cases are associated with Hepatitis B. Other options: Option A: Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis which is associated with necrotizing \ninflammation of small and medium-sized muscular arteries. Option B: Patients show hypergammaglobulinemia. Option C: PAN is rarely associated with ANCA positivity. There is no serological test for PAN. \nMost patients exhibit an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils. PAN is usually seen in young adults, characterized by rapidly accelerating hypertension, \nabdominal pain, bloody stools, myalgias, and peripheral neuropathy. Arterial inflammation is segmental, necrotizing, and transmural, leading to aneurysms and \nthrombosis. The involved vessels are typically found at arterial bifurcations, spreading to veins but sparing \nvenules. The most commonly affected organs are the kidney, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal \ntract, in that order. Pulmonary arteries are not involved. Inadequate blood flow leads to ischemia, \nulcers, infarcts, atrophy, or hemorrhage. Diagnosis relies on histopathological findings from organ biopsies or the demonstration of \naneurysms in small to medium-sized arteries of the renal, hepatic, and visceral vasculature. Untreated PAN has an extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 10 to 20%. \nCommon causes of death include gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel infarcts and \nperforation, as well as cardiovascular issues. Timely treatment is vital for improved outcomes. Combining prednisone and cyclophosphamide has shown significant benefits in survival rates. \nGlucocorticoids alone may be sufficient for milder cases. In PAN cases associated with hepatitis B \nor C, antiviral therapy is combined with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange. Managing \nhypertension effectively can help reduce vascular complications. Despite successful treatment, \nrelapses occur in approximately 10-20% of patients.
