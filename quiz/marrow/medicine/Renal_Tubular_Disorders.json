      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In renal tubular acidosis (RTA), there is normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. RTA refers to a group of disorders in which there is impaired tubular transport of H+ and/or \nHCO3- despite relatively well-preserved renal function. There are 4 types: • Type I - impaired H+ secretion (distal), leading to decreased HCO3- production • Type II - impaired HCO3- reabsorption (proximal) • Type III - carbonic anhydrase deficiency causing defects in the transport of both \nH+ and HCO3- (mixed) • Type IV - hypoaldosteronism (hyperkalemic) The overall deficiency of HCO3- in all the types is compensated by Cl- secretion. Hence, the serum \nanion gap remains normal.",

      "explanation": "Hyperkalemia is a characteristic feature of type 4 RTA or generalized distal RTA. It commonly \noccurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD patients, renal dysfunction results in hyperkalemia only when the GFR is severely \nimpaired (stage 5). Hyperkalemia in the earlier stages of CKD is suggestive of type 4 RTA. In CKD, volume overload leads to low levels of renin and, hence, aldosterone. This leads to Na+ \nloss and K+ retention in the distal tubule. The resultant hyperkalemia causes impaired NH3 \nsynthesis in the proximal tubule. Hence, H+ cannot be excreted as NH4+ ions. Retained H+ ions \nlead to reduced HCO3- production and acidosis.",

      "explanation": "Urinary pH will be &gt; 5.5 after acid loading in RTA type 1. In this condition, there is a defect in H+ secretion by the distal tubules. Hence, there is a failure of \nurine acidification. H+ combines with NH3 to form NH■■ and thus in RTA type 1, NH4+ \nexcretion is reduced. In the acid loading test, acidosis is induced by the administration of NH4Cl \n(releases H+). In normal individuals, this results in increased excretion of H+, leading to acidic \nurine (pH &lt; 5.5). However, this fails to occur in RTA type 1. Impaired secretion of H+ leads to potassium wasting and hypokalemia (via the H+/K+ATPase \nantiporter). The resulting metabolic acidosis causes bone demineralization and resorption.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Renal stones are not a feature of type 2 or proximal RTA. This is because high levels of citrate in \nthe urine bind with calcium and prevent stone formation. In this condition, the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) fail to reabsorb HCO3-. In the \ninitial stages, this HCO3- loss leads to a urine pH &gt; 5.5. However, as the body's HCO3- stores \nare depleted, the urinary pH falls to &lt; 5.5 as the secretion of H+ in the DCT remains intact. \nHence, the minimum urinary pH is &lt; 5.5. It can be caused by Lowe's syndrome but a majority of type 2 RTA cases are associated with \nFanconi's syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a generalized defect of reabsorption of \nvarious substances at the PCT. This leads to loss of HCO3-, glucose, amino acids, phosphate, \ncitrate, and calcium in the urine. Loss of phosphate leads to vitamin-D resistant \nhypophosphatemic rickets /osteomalacia.
