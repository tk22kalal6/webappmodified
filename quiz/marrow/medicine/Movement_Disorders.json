      "explanation": "1219 \nSold by @itachibot The structure marked in this transverse section of the brain at the level of superior colliculus is \nsubstantia nigra. Degeneration of substantia nigra is seen in Parkinson's disease, also known as \nparalysis agitans. Substantia nigra is pigmented due to the presence of neuromelanin granules, which help in the \nsynthesis of dopamine. In Parkinson's disease, there is an absence/reduced pigmentation of the \nsubstantia nigra. Bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor are classic features of Parkinson's disease. Because of \nmotor disability, it is also referred to as paralysis agitans. Other options: Option B: Depression is often a comorbid finding with Parkinson's disease, but is not due to \ndamage to the substantia nigra. Option C: Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is due to atrophy of the \nentorhinal cortex, located in the medial temporal lobe. Option D: Huntington’s chorea is an autosomal dominant disorder of movement and cognition \nprimarily involving the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen).",

      "explanation": "The most common form of monogenic familial PD is PARK8, caused by mutations in the \nleucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) gene. Familial forms of parkinsonism (designated PARK1 through PARK13) have been associated with \ncausative mutations in a number of nuclear genes. A few of these are: • The LRRK2 gene mutation causes autosomal dominant PD (PARK8). In this condition, Middle \nto late-onset PD is seen, which resembles typical PD and is responsive to levodopa. • Mutations in alpha-synuclein (PARK 1 and PARK4) cause rare forms of familial PD and \nconstitute the major component of Lewy bodies in sporadic PD. 1220 \nSold by @itachibot • Parkin-associated PD (PARK 2) &amp; PINK1-associated PD (PARK6) are autosomal recessive \nseen in young-onset PD. • Mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) gene of Gauchers represents the most important \nrisk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. Patients with PD who are GBA mutation \ncarriers have a younger age at onset.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In restless leg syndrome (RLS), symptoms begin or worsen with rest. It is also called as \nWillis-Ekbom disease. The four core symptoms required for the diagnosis of RLS are: • An urge to move the legs • Usually caused or accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the legs (creepy-crawly feeling, \nparesthesia, or burning) • Symptoms that begin or worsen with rest and partial or complete relief by movement • Worsening during the evening or night Restless leg syndrome is a typical sensory-motor disorder that generally affects the legs during \nrest periods, especially sleep. There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated \nwith burning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergic 1232 \nSold by @itachibot hypofunction is postulated. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating \nfactors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, \ngabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, \nropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term \naugmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders. FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: • Gabapentin • Ropinirole • Pramipexole • Rotigotine A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from \ngabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of \nmoderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a \nhistory of substance use disorder. Non-pharmacological treatments that can be used in restless leg syndrome are: • Avoiding alcohol at bedtime • Massaging affected legs • Hot baths • Applying hot or cold to the affected area • Engaging in moderate exercises 1233 \nSold by @itachibot ALS and Other Motor Neuron Diseases",
