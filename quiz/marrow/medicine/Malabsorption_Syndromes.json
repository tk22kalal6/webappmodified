      "explanation": "Constipation is not a feature of malabsorption syndrome. Malabsorption syndrome refers to a spectrum of conditions of various etiologies that arises due to \ndiminished absorption of one or more dietary nutrients. The general features of malabsorption syndrome are abdominal pain, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and \nweight loss. Anemia may be present when there is defective absorption of iron, folate, or vitamin B12. \nHypocalcemia and tetany can be seen due to defective absorption of vitamin D.",

      "explanation": "A small bowel diverticulum can result in malabsorption. A small bowel diverticulum is a blind pouch protruding from the small intestine that \ncommunicates with the lumen of the gut. It becomes a potential site for bacterial overgrowth \nwhich causes malabsorption. The growing gut bacteria depletes vitamin B12 and deconjugates bile \nacids leading to steatorrhea, diarrhea, and macrocytic anemia. Anterior colon resection, ulcerative colitis, and sigmoid volvulus affect the large intestine and \ntherefore do not cause malabsorption.",

      "explanation": "Homocystinuria is not a protein malabsorption disorder. It is a disorder of methionine \nmetabolism that leads to increased homocysteine levels. Proteins are broken down by pancreatic enzymes and are absorbed as amino acids and peptides. \nSo, protein malabsorption usually occurs only in pancreatic insufficiency. Additionally, there are \nthree rare genetic disorders that lead to protein malabsorption. They are: • Enterokinase deficiency- Defective conversion of the proenzyme trypsinogen to trypsin.

A normal xylose test and normal duodenal biopsy rules out small intestinal pathologies like celiac \ndisease (option A) and intestinal lymphangiectasia (option C), presence of steatorrhea rules out \nulcerative colitis (option B) as it affects the large bowel which is not the main site of absorption of \nfat. 428 \nSold by @itachibot Ileal disease is also characterized by normal xylose test, normal duodenal biopsy and steatorrhea \nand abnormal schilling test but among the given options the most appropriate answer would be \npancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic insufficiency is characterised by the deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes that \nresult in maldigestion and malabsorption. The features in favor of the diagnosis: • Steatorrhea - a deficiency of pancreatic lipases can lead to undigested fat in stools. • D-xylose test - d-xylose is a monosaccharide that is directly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa \nwithout undergoing any enzymatic action. Normal d-xylose test denotes intact mucosa. • Schilling test - it is abnormal as pancreatic enzymes are required for the absorption of vitamin \nB12.

The single best test for which is checking serum for the \npresence of IgA tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG) antibodies (Option D). Celiac disease is a disorder characterized by an immunological response to gluten causing damage \nto the proximal intestinal mucosa (villous atrophy) and malabsorption of nutrients. Symptoms usually begin 6 to 24 months from the introduction of gluten into diet, although most \npatients go undiagnosed. The common manifestations are - irritability, abdominal distention, chronic diarrhea, weight loss \nor muscle wasting and extra-intestinally, the symptoms observed are aphthous ulcers, delayed \npuberty, iron deficiency anemia and short stature. Screening for celiac disease is by testing for tissue transglutaminase IgA, endomysial, and \ndeamidated antigliadin antibodies. IgA levels in serum are measured to detect false-negative \nresults because of IgA deficiency. Small intestinal biopsy shows characteristic villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and increased \nintraepithelial lymphocytes. 432 \nSold by @itachibot The treatment involves the exclusion of gluten-containing food from diet.

Cotrimoxazole is used in the \nmaintenance phase of the treatment of Whipple's disease.

It has high CNS \npenetration so it is used in maintenance to prevent relapse. 435 \nSold by @itachibot",

Improvement in symptoms after folic acid intake is a hallmark of tropical sprue. Tropical sprue is an acquired malabsorptive condition of probable infectious aetiology. It is seen \nin people from the tropics such as India, Southeast Asia and South America. Tropical sprue and celiac disease have similar clinical, endoscopic and histologic findings. \nHowever, a positive celiac serology (anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies) \ncan be used to rule out tropical sprue.",
