      "explanation": "The given findings of positive Moses' sign with elevated D-dimer, lupus anticoagulant, and \nanti-cardiolipin antibodies are suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Glucocorticoids \nare not useful in the general management of APS, they are used only in the treatment of \ncatastrophic APS. Squeezing of the relaxed calf muscles from side to side is painful as the thrombosed deep veins in \nthe calf are always tender. This test is known as Moses’ sign. The clinical manifestations in APS occur due to the activation of coagulation and thrombus \nformation. Therefore, anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are the mainstays in the treatment. \nImportant drugs used are: • Warfarin- is an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K dependant epoxidase. • Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH)- warfarin cannot be used in pregnancy due to its \nteratogenicity. In these situations, LMWH is used for anticoagulation. • Aspirin- is an antiplatelet agent. • Hydroxychloroquine- is an immunomodulatory agent that can be used to prevent recurrent \nthrombosis. • Statins Note: The only condition where corticosteroids are beneficial is catastrophic APS. It is a \nlife-threatening rapidly progressive thromboembolic disease involving simultaneously three or \nmore organs. It is seen in very few patients. 556 \nSold by @itachibot 557 \nSold by @itachibot Rheumatoid Arthritis",
