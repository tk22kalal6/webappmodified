      "options": {
        "a": "Hemoglobin tetramer is highly soluble.",
        "b": "Individual globin chains are soluble.",
        "c": "Each heme moiety can bind to two O2 molecules.",
        "d": "Each heme moiety consists of Iron in the ferric state."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The hemoglobin tetramer is highly soluble in the plasma. However, individual globin chains are \ninsoluble. Unpaired globin precipitates can form inclusions that damage the cell and trigger \napoptosis. Each hemoglobin molecule consists of a tetramer of globin polypeptide chains. This includes a \npair of -like chains and a pair of -like chains. Each globin chain enfolds a single heme moiety. \nHeme consists of a protoporphyrin IX ring complexed with a single iron atom in the ferrous state \n(Fe2+). Each heme moiety can bind one O2 molecule. The common forms of hemoglobin include: • HbA (22): Major adult hemoglobin • HbF (22): Fetal hemoglobin • HbA2 (22): Minor adult hemoglobin",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Patients with -thalassemia are susceptible to infection with Plasmodium vivax. Thalassemia provides natural protection against infection with the more lethal Plasmodium \nfalciparum. There is no conclusive evidence on the relationship between alpha thalassemia and P. \nmalariae or P. ovale infection. Conditions protective against Plasmodium falciparum include: • Sickle cell trait • Hemoglobin C • Hemoglobin SC • Hemoglobin E • Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) • Alpha and beta-thalassemia • Band 3 mutation • G6PD deficiency 1461 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given image shows sickled RBCs, suggestive of sickle cell anemia. It occurs due to the \nreplacement of the 6th glutamic acid by valine in the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11. This mutation is due to a single nucleotide substitution (from GAG to GTG). The resulting amino \nacid substitution causes hydrophobic sickling of RBCs.",

      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The features of multiple episodes of acute severe pain in fingers and toes with spontaneous \nresolution are suggestive of dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome), which usually occurs in sickle cell \nanemia. The sickled RBCs have a sticking tendency towards the endothelium of the small venules. These \nabnormalities provoke unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusion. Dactylitis is characterized by \nsevere pain affecting the bones of the hands, feet, or both. It is often the first symptom of sickle \ncell anemia in children. Treatment - Administration of patient-controlled analgesia or a frequent fixed dose of opioids with \nrescue doses for breakthrough pain are preferred with frequent monitoring during the initial \n48-72 hrs to prevent unexpected death due to arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism. Other manifestations include: • Splenic autoinfarction - repeated splenic microinfarcts • Acute splenic sequestration - venous obstruction, needing emergency transfusion/splenectomy • Painful ischemic crises - vaso-occlusion in connective and musculoskeletal tissue • Renal papillary necrosis leading to isosthenuria • Cerebrovascular strokes • Chronic lower leg ulcers • Priapism in males -thalassemia (Option A) and -thalassemia (Option B) are characterized by pallor, jaundice, \ngrowth failure, hepatosplenomegaly, characteristic thalassemic facies, and hair-on-end \nappearance of the skull. Option D: Von Willebrand Disease is characterized by predominantly mucosal bleeding symptoms \nlike excessive bruising and epistaxis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Gemcitabine is an anti-metabolite and has no effect on HbF levels. The following drugs increase HbF levels and hence can be used in the management of sickle cell \nanemia: • Hydroxyurea - mainstay of therapy for patients with severe symptoms • 5-azacytidine - associated with acute toxicity and carcinogenesis • 5-deoxyazacytidine or decitabine - alternative with less toxicity",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Hb M Iwata causes congenital methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin is generated by oxidation of the heme iron moieties to the ferric state, causing a \ncharacteristic bluish-brown muddy color resembling cyanosis. Methemoglobin has such high \noxygen affinity that virtually no oxygen is delivered. Levels &gt;50–60% are often fatal. Congenital methemoglobinemia arises from globin mutations that stabilize iron in the ferric state \n(HbM Iwata) or mutations that impair the enzymes that reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin \n(methemoglobin reductase, NADP diaphorase). Acquired methemoglobinemia is caused by toxins that oxidize heme iron such as: • Chloroquine 1463 \nSold by @itachibot • Dapsone • Sulfonamides • Nitroglycerin The following image shows chocolate-brown discoloration of blood in methemoglobinemia.",
