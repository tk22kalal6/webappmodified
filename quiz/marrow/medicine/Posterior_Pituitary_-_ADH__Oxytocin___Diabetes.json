      "explanation": "Oxytocin plays a role in milk ejection. It also helps in initiation or facilitation of labour by \nstimulating the contraction of uterine smooth muscles. It stimulates postpartum milk let-down in response to suckling. Prolactin is the hormone responsible for milk production. 84 \nSold by @itachibot Osmoregulation is mediated by hormones such as ADH, aldosterone, etc.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "AVP binds to V2 receptors on the serosal surface (also called basolateral surface) of renal tubular \ncells. This interaction activates adenylyl cyclase and leads to the insertion of water channels called \naquaporin 2 on the luminal surface of the cell.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "ADH secretion reduces when the plasma osmolality becomes low. ADH causes water reabsorption \nand dilutes the plasma, thereby causing a reduction in plasma osmolality. The antidiuretic effect of ADH is mediated via a G protein-coupled V2 receptor that increases \nintracellular cyclic AMP, thereby inducing translocation of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) water channels \ninto the apical membrane. During and after surgery, surgical stress results in the release of ADH.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A mutation in the gene for aquaporin 2 channel leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The antidiuretic hormone (ADH) binds to V2 receptors in the late distal tubules, collecting \ntubules, and collecting ducts, and stimulates the movement of an intracellular protein, called \naquaporin-2 (AQP-2), to the luminal side of the cell membranes. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition in which there is the absence of or poor response to \nanti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This results in reduced permeability of the distal tubules and \ncollecting ducts to water. This furthermore leads the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute \nurine that clinically manifests as polyuria and polydipsia. DI can be of four types : Note: Lithium - used to treat bipolar disorder, can cause acquired diabetes insipidus by decreasing \nthe expression of the AQP2 gene. 85 \nSold by @itachibot Option A : Liddle’s syndrome is due to an inherited gain of function mutation of genes regulating \nthe Na channel in collecting duct ENaC, characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and \nmetabolic alkalosis. Option C : Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutation in CFTR gene that \nserves as a channel in the luminal plasma membranes of epithelial cells and regulates volume and \ncomposition of secretions in exocrine glands. Option D : Bartter syndrome is due to loss-of-function mutations of transporters and ion channels \nin thick ascending loop of henle, most commonly, Na-K-2Cl transporter.

      "explanation": "The given scenario and the absence of a posterior pituitary bright spot on MRI are suggestive of \ncentral diabetes insipidus. Multiple sclerosis causes primary polydipsia, not central DI. Central DI is caused by a primary deficiency in AVP secretion which usually results from agenesis \nor irreversible destruction of the posterior pituitary.

Treatment of diabetes insipidus: • Central and gestational diabetes insipidus: • Desmopressin an ADH analog • Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: • Adequate water intake along with a low sodium diet • Thiazide diuretics • Potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene and amiloride): Amiloride is the drug of choice for \nlithium-induced DI • Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin) 89 \nSold by @itachibot • Psychogenic diabetes insipidus: • Behavioral therapy to reduce fluid consumption",
