      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, is most commonly caused by \nautoimmune adrenalitis. Tuberculous adrenalitis is still a frequent cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in developing \ncountries like India. It is characterized by the loss of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and \nadrenal androgen secretion. Glucocorticoid deficiency results in fatigue, lack of energy, weight loss, fever, myalgia, \nnormochromic anemia, and hypoglycemia. Mineralocorticoid deficiency is characterized by \nnausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, postural hypotension, salt craving, hyponatremia, and \nhyperkalemia. Adrenal androgen deficiency manifests as a lack of energy, dry itchy skin, loss of \nlibido, and loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women). Hyperpigmentation is seen in primary adrenal insufficiency due to excess \nproopiomelanocortin-derived peptides. Hyperpigmentation is not seen in secondary adrenal \ninsufficiency. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be made with the short cosyntropin test (cortisol level \n&lt;450-500nmol/L sampled 30 to 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation is diagnostic of adrenal \ninsufficiency). Plasma ACTH, plasma renin, and serum aldosterone can help differentiate primary \nfrom secondary causes. Primary adrenal insufficiency will show elevated ACTH and a \ncompensatory elevation in renin levels due to decreased aldosterone in the body. In secondary \nadrenal insufficiency, ACTH is low with normal renin and aldosterone. Treatment includes glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and adrenal androgen replacement. Other options: 159 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Patients with adrenocortical carcinoma present with features of glucocorticoid and \nadrenal androgen excess, and not adrenal insufficiency. Options C and D: Hypernephroma and medullary carcinoma thyroid are not associated with \nAddison's disease.",

In this \npatient who is a known case of adrenal insufficiency, IV hydrocortisone is the drug of choice. However, in patients with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency, dexamethasone is used for the \ntreatment of adrenal crisis. This is because dexamethasone is not measured in cortisol assays and \nwould not interfere with the diagnostic tests, whereas hydrocortisone interferes with cortisol \nassays. Acute adrenal insufficiency requires the immediate initiation of the following therapeutic \nstrategies: • Rehydration - saline infusion at an initial rate of 1 L/h with continuous cardiac monitoring. • Glucocorticoid replacement - bolus injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone, followed by the \nmaintenance dose of 100–200 mg over 24h. • Mineralocorticoid replacement - initiated once the daily hydrocortisone dose has been reduced \nto &lt;50 mg as higher doses of hydrocortisone have sufficient mineralocorticoid action.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Hyperkalemia will not improve following administration of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is a \nlong-acting steroid with glucocorticoid action. It has no effect on hyperkalemia, which is mediated \nby mineralocorticoids. Hyponatremia is chiefly due to mineralocorticoid deficiency, however, hypocortisolism causes \nhyponatremia due to loss of feedback inhibition of ADH resulting in SIADH (syndrome of \ninappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). 163 \nSold by @itachibot Hypocortisolism can also cause postural hypotension as cortisol regulates vascular tone by \npotentiating the effects of vasoconstrictors. Thus on administration dexamethasone hyponatremia \nand postural hypotension will improve as dexamethasone has glucocorticoid action but \nhyperkalemia will not improve. Dexamethasone is used in patients with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency as it does not \ninterfere with serum cortisol measurement.
