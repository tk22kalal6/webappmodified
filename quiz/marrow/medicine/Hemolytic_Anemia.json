It is caused due to an acquired somatic mutation leading to deficiency of membrane protective \nfactors CD59 and CD55. This makes the RBC extremely sensitive to complement activation and \ncauses intravascular hemolysis. The other conditions occur due to extracorpuscular defects. Option A: In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, RBCs are coated with autoantibodies. This \ntriggers phagocytosis in the reticuloendothelial system leading to extravascular hemolysis. Option C: Familial hemolytic uremic syndrome (atypical HUS) is an inherited abnormality with \nexcessive complement activation leading to episodic and excessive production of membrane attack \ncomplex destroying normal RBCs.

      "explanation": "Deficiency of CD55 and CD59 is seen in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It is due to an acquired mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol class A PIG-A gene (Option \nA) causing a deficiency of GPI anchor proteins. GPI is a glycolipid that anchors membrane \nprotective factors such as CD59 and CD55 to the membrane. The deficiency of CD55 and CD59 \nmakes the RBC sensitive to complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis(Option B). The anemia \nis usually normo-macrocytic (Option D). Hemolysis tends to occur at night due to a slight decrease in blood pH during sleep, which \ntriggers complement activity (nocturnal hemoglobinuria).

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Deferoxamine has poor oral bioavailability and is administered parenterally (SC/IV). Oral formulations of both deferiprone and deferasirox are available. The adverse effects of iron chelators include: • Deferiprone - neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. • Deferasirox - transaminitis and mild, asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine • Deferoxamine - occasional cataracts, deafness, and local skin reactions, but is usually \nwell-tolerated",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Naked eye single tube red-cell osmotic fragility test (NESTROFT) is the most sensitive test to \ndetect thalassemia in the population. Hence, it is an effective screening test. The principle is based on the decreased osmotic fragility of red cells in thalassemia. It is \nperformed as follows: • Mix EDTA blood and 0.36% buffered saline solution. • Shake the tube and leave it at room temperature for 30 minutes. • Shake the tube again and immediately hold the tube in front of a piece of paper with text. The image below shows a positive NESTROF test (test tube marked as T1) as the line is not visible \nthrough the test tube. The test tube marked as C shows the control (Please note that a negative \nNESTROF test would show visible lines similar to the appearance of the control).

      "explanation": "Acute pain crisis is the most common clinical presentation of sickle cell anemia. These are intermittent episodes of vaso-occlusion in connective and musculoskeletal structures. \nThis results in ischemia resulting in acute pain and tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and \nanxiety. The management includes vigorous hydration, evaluation for underlying causes, and \naggressive analgesia. Other manifestations of sickle cell anemia include: • Hand-foot syndrome - painful infarcts of the digits and dactylitis • Priapism - infarction of the penile venous outflow tracts • Chronic lower leg ulcers - ischemia and superinfection in the distal circulation • Splenic sequestration crisis - life-threatening complication due to acute venous obstruction that \nrequires emergency transfusion and/or splenectomy • Aplastic crisis - commonly secondary to parvovirus B19 infection • Acute chest syndrome - sickling within the lung, producing pain and temporary pulmonary \ndysfunction. Treatment may include lifelong transfusion support, using partial exchange \ntransfusion • Stroke - common in children 1327 \nSold by @itachibot Myeloproliferative Disorders and Aplastic Anemia",
