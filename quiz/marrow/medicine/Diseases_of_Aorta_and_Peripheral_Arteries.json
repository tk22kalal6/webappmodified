      "explanation": "1029 \nSold by @itachibot Aortic aneurysms caused by spondyloarthropathies are most commonly seen in the ascending \naorta. An aneurysm is a pathologic dilation of a segment of a blood vessel. An aortic aneurysm occurs \nwhen the structural components of the aortic wall, that is, elastin and collagen, are damaged. This \nmay occur either due to degradation or abnormal synthesis of these components. The causes of aneurysm are as follows: Etiology \nMost common site Degenerative process-oxidati \nve and biomechanical stressA \ntherosclerosisAgingCigarette \nsmokingHypertension Descending thoracic aorta, a \nbdominal aorta Ascending aorta Medial degeneration/Cystic \nmedial necrosis- degenerativ \ne changes in the tunica medi \na of the aortaHypertensionGe \nnetic syndromes likeMarfan’s \nsyndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndr \nome, etc. Ascending aorta/aortic arch InfectiousCauses \nSyphilitic aneurysms-periaort \nitis and mesoaortitis damage \nthe elastic fibers Thoracic aorta Tuberculous aneurysms-gran \nulomatous destruction of the \nmedia Aorta Mycotic aneurysms-bacterial \nor fungal infections of the ao \nrta Aortic arch, descending thora \ncic aorta Aortitis \nTakayasu’s arteritis & Giant c \nell arteritis (vasculitides) Ascending aorta Spondyloarthropathies-ankyl \nosing spondylitis, rheumatoi \nd arthritis, etc. Traumatic-chest trauma \nDescending thoracic aorta",

      "explanation": "The most common pathology associated with ascending aortic aneurysm is medial degeneration. Medial degeneration (cystic medial necrosis) describes the degenerative process of the tunica \nmedia of the aorta. There is degeneration of collagen and elastic fibers in the media and loss of \nmedial cells that are replaced by multiple clefts of mucoid material, such as proteoglycans. It is seen in the following conditions and is associated with the corresponding mutations: • Marfan’s syndrome- fibrillin 1 1030 \nSold by @itachibot • Loeys-Dietz syndrome- TGFBR1, TGFBR2 • Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV - type III procollagen • Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndromes- genes associated with actin and myosin eg. \nACTA2, MHC11 • Congenital bicuspid aortic valves • Turner’s syndrome • Hypertension",

In the case of \nMarfan's syndrome, ascending aortic aneurysm of 4-5 cm is taken up for operative repair. This is \nbecause of a higher rate of expansion of the aneurysm in these patients. Management of thoracic aortic aneurysm: • Beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists reduce the rate of expansion, especially in \nMarfan's syndrome. • Operative treatment is indicated in: • All symptomatic cases • Ascending aortic aneurysm -  5.5 cm in diameter or growth rate of &gt;0.5 cm/year • Descending aortic aneurysm - &gt; 6 cm in diameter or growth rate of &gt;1 cm/year • Marfan's syndrome - 4-5 cm in diameter",

Operative \nrepair is indicated for both symptomatic or asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms if they are \n 5.5 cm in diameter. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are mostly asymptomatic and are detected as incidental findings on \ninvestigations for other complaints. Sometimes, they present with pain and pulsatile abdominal \nmass. Rupture of aneurysm presents with acute pain and hypotension. Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms: • Statins- atherosclerosis is the most common pathology associated with abdominal aortic \naneurysms. Hence, statins are prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. • Asymptomatic aneurysms &lt;5.5 cm in diameter- serial abdominal ultrasound to monitor the \nrate of expansion of the aneurysm. • Operative repair is indicated for: 1031 \nSold by @itachibot • Aneurysm of any size associated with symptoms • Rapidly growing aneurysms • Aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter Note: Medical management with beta-blockers though helps in BP control, it is not effective in \nreducing the rate of growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the CT image showing double-lumen of the aorta are suggestive of \naortic dissection. Isolated use of a direct vasodilator such as hydralazine is contraindicated in \nacute dissection. It is because these agents can increase hydraulic shear and worsen the dissection by causing \nvasodilation without reducing the left ventricular ejection force that continues to weaken the \narterial wall. Medical therapy for aortic dissection includes beta-blockers and sodium nitroprusside to reduce \ncardiac contractility and blood pressure. The heart rate is reduced to around 60 bpm and the SBP \nis lowered to  120mmHg. CCBs like verapamil and diltiazem may be used IV if nitroprusside or beta-blockers cannot be \nemployed. Parenteral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as enalaprilat may be \nconsidered.",

The classification schemes for aortic dissection are: • Stanford classification • Type A - dissection involves the ascending aorta with or without the involvement of other parts \nof the aorta • Type B - dissection is limited to the arch and/or descending aorta without the involvement of \nascending aorta • DeBakey classification • Type I - dissection involves ascending to descending aorta • Type II - dissection is limited to the ascending aorta or transverse aorta without descending \naorta 1033 \nSold by @itachibot • Type III - intimal tear is located in the descending aorta with distal propagation of the dissection Hence, if the ascending aorta is involved, it is Stanford type A and DeBakey type I or II. If only the \naortic arch or the descending aorta is involved, it is Stanford type B and DeBakey type III. From a management standpoint, the classification of aortic dissections into type A or B is more \npractical and useful, since DeBakey types I and II are managed in a similar manner.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario describes intermittent claudication. It is the most common symptom of \nperipheral arterial disease (PAD). The most appropriate advice for this patient is antiplatelet \ntherapy with aspirin. PAD occurs due to atherosclerotic plaques causing stenosis and occlusion of blood flow. The \nsymptoms of inadequate blood flow exacerbate during increased physical activity. The following advice is given to patients with PAD: • Lifestyle modification- regular exercise, discontinue smoking • Statins to treat hypercholesterolemia • Reducing the risk of cardiovascular events: • Controlling hypertension- angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor \nblockers, beta-blockers • Antiplatelet therapy- aspirin, clopidogrel • Revascularization procedures (catheter-based or surgical)- For patients not improving with \nmedical therapy • Endovascular interventions- percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), stent \nplacement, atherectomy 1034 \nSold by @itachibot • Surgical- aortobifemoral bypass using Dacron grafts, axillofemoral bypass, femoro-femoral \nbypass Antiplatelet therapy and warfarin is not preferred because of the high risk of bleeding. Intravenous heparin is used to treat acute limb ischemia which most often occurs due to \nthromboembolic events. Acute limb ischemia presents with loss of pulses distal to the occlusion, \ncyanosis, or pallor. These symptoms do not subside on taking rest. Hence, this patient has \nintermittent claudication and not acute limb ischemia.",
