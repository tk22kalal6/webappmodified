      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most common inflammatory myopathy seen in elderly patients (&gt;50 years) is inclusion \nbody myositis. Inclusion body myositis is a type of inflammatory myopathy. It is characterized by progressive, \nasymmetric muscle weakness most commonly involving the wrist, finger flexors, and quadriceps. \nMuscles of the face and neck may also be involved, presenting as dysphagia. Inclusion body myositis is named so because of the presence of inclusion bodies containing \namyloid-like protein seen on microscopy.",

Inclusion body myositis is a type of inflammatory myopathy. It is seen in people older than 50 \nyears of age. It is characterized by progressive, asymmetric muscle weakness most commonly \ninvolving the wrist, finger flexors, and quadriceps.
