      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is associated with metabolic alkalosis, not metabolic acidosis. It is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that presents with the following features: • Glucocorticoid deficiency: • Hypoglycemia • Hyperpigmentation around the genitals due to excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) \nsecretion • Mineralocorticoid excess: • Hypokalemia • Hypertension • Metabolic alkalosis • Adrenal androgen excess • Virilization in females • Precocious puberty in males 213 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with ambiguous genitalia in a male neonate is suggestive of 17 \nalpha-hydroxylase deficiency. It causes hypertension and hypokalemia due to the accumulation of \n11-deoxycorticosterone, which is a mineralocorticoid causing sodium retention. 11-hydroxylase deficiency also leads to the accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hypoglycemia is a feature of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. It results in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and \nhypotension. Males typically present with salt-wasting crises as they often go undiagnosed at birth \ndue to the presence of normal genitalia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The drug of choice for the prenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to \n21-hydroxylase deficiency is dexamethasone, as it readily crosses the placenta. It is an experimental approach aimed at reducing the virilization of 46XX fetuses by suppressing \nfetal adrenal steroid and androgen secretion. It may be considered when there is a high risk of \nCAH due to strong family history. It is effective only when started before 4 weeks of gestation. Hydrocortisone is given in the children at divided doses of 1–1.5 times the normal cortisol \nproduction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Ambiguous genitalia, elevated 17-(OH)-progesterone, and hypoglycemia are suggestive \nof 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The drug of choice is hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone acts as a potent glucocorticoid with mineralocorticoid action and thus increases \nsalt absorption from the kidneys as well. Betamethasone, beclomethasone, and dexamethasone have negligible effects as \nmineralocorticoids.",

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is also a possible diagnosis with the above clinical presentation \nand must be ruled out before diagnosing a Sertoli cell tumor. The differential diagnosis of gynecomastia is as follows: • High LH and low testosterone • Testicular failure • Low LH and low testosterone • Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism • Sertoli cell tumor - increased primary estrogen production • High LH and high testosterone • Androgen-resistant state • GnRH-secreting tumor",
