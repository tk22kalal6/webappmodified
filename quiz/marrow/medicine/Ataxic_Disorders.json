      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of the involvement of the posterior column. Posterior column carries proprioception which is essential for coordination of motor movements. \nLoss of this leads to the development of a stomping gait. This is seen in cases of vitamin B12 \ndeficiency leading to subacute combined degeneration, tabes dorsalis or diabetic neuropathy.",

Friedrich's ataxia has autosomal recessive inheritance and presents before 25 years of age. The \nmedian age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Friedrich's ataxia presents with clinical features such as dysarthria, progressive staggering gait, \nfrequent falls and titubation. Other neurological symptoms include nystagmus, loss of fast 1246 \nSold by @itachibot saccadic movements, loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation, and ataxia or trunk and limb \nmovements. The lower extremities are more severely involved than the upper ones. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. It presents with cardiomegaly, symmetric \nhypertrophy, and conduction defects. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include \nprogressive scoliosis, pes cavus, and pes equinovarus.",

The primary sites of pathology are the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion cells, and the peripheral \nnerves. Spinal cord tracts are involved, and degeneration occurs predominantly in the spinocerebellar \ntracts, lateral corticospinal tracts, and posterior columns. Degeneration of cranial nerves \n(glossopharyngeal, vagus, hypoglossal) and deep cerebellar nuclei can occur. Peripheral nerves are \nalso involved, and there's a loss of large myelinated fibers.

Tabes dorsalis (or syphilitic myelopathy) is a slow degeneration and demyelination of the neural \ntracts. It is seen in tertiary syphilis. It primarily involves the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and \ndorsal roots. It presents with the following clinical features: • Loss of reflexes in lower limbs • Romberg's sign • Bilateral Argyll Robertson pupils - accommodation reflex present, pupillary reflex absent • Loss of position sense and vibration • Stabbing/pricking pain in the legs - this is fleeting or repetitive • Ataxia of the legs and gait disturbances • Paresthesias • Bladder disturbances • Acute abdominal pain with vomiting - visceral crisis Note: Diabetic polyradiculopathy may simulate tabes. 1248 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given case scenario describes an elderly woman with urinary incontinence, dementia \n(cognitive decline), and a history of multiple falls (suggestive of a gait abnormality or ataxia). \nThese form the classical triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Both frontotemporal dementia (Option B) and Parkinson’s disease (Option C) are common causes \nof dementia associated with falls, but urinary incontinence is not commonly appreciated. NPH is, \ntherefore, the most likely diagnosis. Normal pressure hydrocephalus refers to a disproportionate enlargement of the ventricles \ncompared to the degree of cortical atrophy. It is a communicating hydrocephalus caused by \ndelayed resorption of cerebrospinal fluid. Out of the classical triad of symptoms, most patients \npresent with one or two. Hence, neuroimaging showing dilated ventricles is essential, as well as an \nL- dopa challenge test to rule out parkinson’s disease is recommended.
