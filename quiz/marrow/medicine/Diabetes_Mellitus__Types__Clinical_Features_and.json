      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Weight loss is a clinical feature of diabetes mellitus, not weight gain. Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of common metabolic disorders that result in hyperglycemia. It \ncauses the following classical triad of symptoms: • Polyuria - due to osmotic diuresis • Polydipsia - triggered by the resulting hypovolemia • Weight loss - due to catabolic state Note: Obesity is a risk factor, not a symptom of type 2 diabetes mellitus and plays a role in its \npathogenesis. Increase in the adipocyte mass leads to an increase in the level of circulating free \nfatty acids. Free fatty acids impair glucose utilization in skeletal muscles, promote glucose 175 \nSold by @itachibot production by the liver, and impair beta-cell function.",

      "explanation": "In type 2 diabetes mellitus increased fasting blood sugar is predominantly due to increased \nhepatic gluconeogenesis. In the postprandial period, there is a rise in peripheral blood glucose levels. Due to insulin \nresistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is reduced peripheral uptake of glucose by \ninsulin-sensitive tissues like the liver and skeletal muscles. This results in reduced glucose \nutilization by skeletal muscles as well as reduced glycogenesis in the liver and skeletal muscles. \nThis results in increased postprandial plasma glucose levels. Increased hepatic glucose output predominantly accounts for increased FPG levels, whereas \ndecreased peripheral glucose utilization results in postprandial hyperglycemia.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Dawn phenomenon refers to normal blood glucose levels at 3 am followed by early morning \nhyperglycemia. This occurs due to an early morning surge in plasma growth hormone and cortisol levels, which \nhave an insulin-antagonistic action. In normal individuals, this is countered by increased early \nmorning insulin secretion. However, in diabetic patients, insulin secretion is disrupted which \nresults in the unopposed action of growth hormone. Hence, there will be resulting hyperglycemia. 183 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the first step is to \nassess the arterial blood gas (ABG) levels. This precedes correction of fluid balance, as assessment \nof the current status of the patient is necessary before beginning treatment. A baseline pH and \nelectrolyte level must be obtained. Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The symptoms \ninclude dehydration, nausea, vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, and coma in severe cases. In DKA, the insulin-to-glucagon ratio is decreased which promotes gluconeogenesis, \nglycogenolysis, and ketone body formation in the liver. Ketone bodies exist as ketoacids at \nphysiological pH which are neutralized by bicarbonate. As bicarbonate stores are depleted, \nmetabolic acidosis ensues. Increased lactic acid production also contributes to the acidosis. The diagnostic biochemical criteria for DKA includes: • Hyperglycemia (&gt;250 mg/dL) • Venous pH &lt;7.3 • Plasma/serum bicarbonate &lt;15-18 mmol/L • Increased anion gap • Ketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate [BOHB] &gt;3 mmol/L) and ketonuria Signs of ketoacidosis: • Kussmaul breathing (deep, heavy, non-labored rapid breathing) • Fruity breath odor (acetone) • Prolonged Q-T interval • Diminished neurocognitive function • Coma 184 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The elevated levels of triglycerides (TG) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in diabetes \nmellitus (DM) are due to decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and increased activity of \nhormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Insulin normally has an inhibitory action on HSL and induces LpL on capillary walls. There is an \nabsolute or relative deficiency of insulin in DM. In DM, the activity of LpL is decreased and HSL \nis increased. The increased activity of HSL results in increased mobilisation of fat stores towards lipolysis \nreleasing fatty acids. These fatty acids are partly cleared by the liver, resulting in increased \nsynthesis of VLDL and TG, resulting in dyslipidemia. They can accumulate in the liver, resulting \nin steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). The reduced activity of LpL prevents the clearing of TG and VLDL in the bloodstream and their \nlevels remain elevated. 185 \nSold by @itachibot",
