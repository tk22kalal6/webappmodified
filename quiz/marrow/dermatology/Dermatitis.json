It is seen \nin the age group of 3-16 years. Lesions have scaling and are usually not well marginated. In children, the lesions are often \nconfined to the face and are most common on the cheeks and around the mouth and chin. It is often a manifestation of atopic eczema but it is not confined to atopic individuals. Option A: In leprosy, the hypopigmented patch is often associated with atrophy, loss of sensation, \nand loss of sweating.

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario depicting pruritic lesions at a flexural site along with a family history of \natopy (asthma) is suggestive of atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema (AE). The scratch \nmarks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of \nAD. AD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules, \npapules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesions \nlater become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skin \nand secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area) \nand later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood \nand in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures. The filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and \nintermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier is \nassociated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due to \nenvironmental factors (detergents, hard water, UV light) or local inflammatory \nreactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading to \nreduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrin \nexpression. Other options: Option A: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by \nerythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezzia \nfungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known as \ndandruff. 195 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed \nhypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct \ncontact with the skin.Patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling, \npapules, and papulovesicles. Some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry), \nPPD/Para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. \nPatch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD. Option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A \nStreptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skin \nlesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peau \nd'orange or orange peel-like appearance. 196 \nSold by @itachibot",

The papules \nare intensely itchy and may become exudative and crusted as a result of rubbing. Secondary \ninfection and lymphadenopathy are common. Childhood phase - starts at 18 to 24 months. Papules tend to be replaced by lichenification. The \nsides of the neck may show a striking reticulate pigmentation, sometimes referred to as atopic \ndirty neck.

      "explanation": "The given history points towards the diagnosis of photoallergic contact dermatitis. Photopatch test \nis used to diagnose this condition. It is a delayed-type IV hypersensitivity reaction with a predilection for photo exposed sites with \nwell■demarcated margins where the skin is covered by clothing (at the collar and ‘V’ of the neck, \non the backs of the hands, and on the ankles). It spares the skin behind the earlobe (Wilkinson’s \ntriangle) since it is a photo-protected site. Photopatch test: The standard patch test units are applied in two sets (on either side of the spine) \nand kept covered. One set of patches is removed and exposed to UVA. After irradiation, the other \nset of patches are also removed and both the sites are covered again for 48 hours. A positive \nreaction on the irradiated side only is an indication of photoallergy The image below shows a photopatch test showing reaction after exposure to UVA only. 204 \nSold by @itachibot",
