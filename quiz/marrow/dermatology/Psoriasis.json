      "explanation": "The presence of silvery-white scaly plaques on the extensor aspect of elbows and knees is a \ncharacteristic feature of psoriasis. Grattage test aids in its diagnosis. Scratching (grattage) scales in psoriasis makes the scale appear more silver in color by introducing \nair–keratin interfaces. When the scales are completely scraped off, the basement membrane is \nexposed and is seen as a moist red surface (membrane of Bulkeley) through which dilated \ncapillaries at the tip of elongated dermal papillae are torn, leading to multiple bleeding points. \nThis classical pinpoint bleeding is known as the Auspitz sign. Auspitz sign is due to the elongated, dilated, tortuous vessels in the dermal papilla along \nwith supra papillary thinning of the epidermis.
