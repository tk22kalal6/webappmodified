      "explanation": "The given image shows characteristic target lesions of erythema multiforme. This most commonly \noccurs following a herpes simplex virus infection. The common triggers are: • Herpes simplex infection • Mycoplasma infection • Bacterial infections • Fungal infections • Vaccinations • Malignancy- carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia • Drugs- sulfonamides, rifampicin, penicillins, hydantoin derivatives • Miscellaneous- lupus erythematosus (Rowell Syndrome), sarcoidosis, polyarteritis nodosa Erythema multiforme is best regarded as a self■limiting cytotoxic dermatitis resulting from \ncell■mediated hypersensitivity. It presents clinically with a spectrum of macular, papular, or urticarial lesions, as well as the \nclassic acral iris or ‘target lesions’. Target lesions are less than 3 cm in diameter, rounded, and have three zones: • Central area of dusky erythema or purpura 228 \nSold by @itachibot • Middle paler zone of edema • Outer ring of erythema with a well■defined edge Lesions may involve the palms and the trunk. Oral and genital mucosal membranes lesions are \nassociated with erosions The image below shows target lesions.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Erythema multiforme minor (papular or simplex form) accounts for approximately 80% of cases \nand is the most common form. Clinically erythema multiforme presents as macular, papular, or urticarial lesions, as well as the \nclassic iris or ‘target lesions’, distributed preferentially on the distal extremities. Raised atypical \ntarget lesions having only two of the zones may also be seen and mucous membranes are rarely \ninvolved. Koebnerization accounts for some bizarre clinical distributions. Photoaggravation of erythema multiforme is well recognized. The lesions appear in successive crops for a few days and fade in 1–2 weeks, sometimes leaving \ndusky discoloration.

Option A: Fixed drug eruptions present up to 8 hours of drug intake. These are erythematous \nlesions that heal with hyperpigmentation. Mucosal involvement is rare. Option B: Erythema multiforme shows typical target or raised atypical target lesions, that develop \nover few days and resolve in 2 to 3 weeks.

      "explanation": "The characteristic lesion healing with hyperpigmentation following drug intake is consistent \nwith fixed drug eruption. NSAIDs are the most commonly implicated drug. Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a cutaneous adverse drug reaction characterized by recurrent \nwell■defined lesions occurring at the same sites each time the offending drug is taken. It typically \npresents 30 min to 8 h after drug exposure. The most common drugs that act as triggers are: • NSAIDs (25%) • Paracetamol (15%) • Cotrimoxazole • Tetracyclines FDE is a form of classical delayed■type hypersensitivity reaction. Typically, FDE presents as a sharply defined, round, or oval erythematous and oedematous \nplaque, which evolves to become dusky, violaceous, and occasionally vesicular or bullous lesions. \nLesions are usually solitary or few in number. Commonly affected sites include the lips, genitals, palms, and soles; 5% of cases may have an \nexclusive mucosal involvement. Overall, the most common site involved is the genitalia. The majority of FDE is self■limiting with an excellent prognosis. 234 \nSold by @itachibot Note: The generalized bullous form of FDE should be differentiated from toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis by prior similar history, absence of target lesions, and no involvement of mucosal \nsurfaces.",
