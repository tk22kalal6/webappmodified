      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The above image shows nucleated stratum corneum suggestive of parakeratosis commonly seen in \npsoriasis and actinic keratosis. Parakeratosis refers to abnormal keratinization in which the cells of basal layer divide rapidly \nreaching the stratum corneum faster and do not have time to shed the nucleus. As a result, \nthe nucleated stratum corneum is observed on histopathology. Hyperkeratosis refers to the increased thickness of the stratum corneum. This is observed in \npsoriasis, lichen planus, and ichthyosis.",

This structure is \nfound in various lichenoid tissue reactions. Option A: Copper penny bodies are seen in chromoblastomycosis. Option C: Donovan bodies are seen in granuloma inguinale.

Acanthosis is commonly accompanied by other histological changes such as hypergranulosis, \nhyperkeratosis, and papillomatosis. It is seen in verruca vulgaris, chronic eczema, lupus vulgaris. Kindly note that this should not be confused with the term acantholysis.

Option B: Parakeratosis can be defined as the retention of keratinocyte nuclei within the stratum \ncorneum. It is commonly seen in psoriasis. Option C: Saw toothing refers to the pattern of the dermal-epidermal junction where dermal \npapillae are expanded and the tips of the rete pegs are pointed. It is seen in lichen planus and \nother lichenoid reactions. Option D: Villi refers to elongated dermal papillae usually covered with a single layer of epidermal \ncells, which form the base of a blister cavity as a result of suprabasal acantholysis.
