      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Pinch purpura is diagnostic of primary systemic amyloidosis. Purpuric macules and ecchymoses, especially in the periorbital area, develop with minor \ntrauma due to fragility from amyloid deposition around cutaneous vessels. The common feature of these diseases is the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins of \nmostly light chains (isotypes  and ) serving as amyloid precursors (AL = light chain type/Bence \n˜ones amyloid). Amyloid precipitation within the oral cavity mucosa may present as macroglossia. The given image below shows macroglossia associated with amyloidosis. 585 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Sclerodactyly and Raynauds phenomenon are seen in scleroderma (not scleredema). The symptoms of scleredema are due to a thickened dermis, deposition of mucin, and \nreplacement of subcutaneous fat with coarse collagen fibers. The dermis is 3–4 times thicker than normal due to an increase of type 1 collagen synthesis by \ndysfunctional fibroblast. However, fibroblast proliferation is not seen. Erythema and a peau \nd’orange appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristically \nspared. Diabetic scleredema is the most common type. Here, the accumulation of collagen may be due to \nirreversible non■enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation by \ncollagenase. It can also occur post-streptococcal infections. The image shows scleredema in a diabetic patient with firm non■pitting edema and induration on \nthe upper back, neck, and shoulders on an erythematous background. 586 \nSold by @itachibot",

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare chronic and granulomatous skin disorder that affects \nonly 0.3% of diabetic patients. The average age of onset is 30 years, with females being affected \nmore commonly. Its postulated etiology is microangiopathy. Most rashes are located on the legs, especially above the tibiae. It may present as red papules that \nenlarge to form patches or plaques with an atrophic yellowish-brown and slightly depressed \ncenter.The lesions may resolve spontaneously or become persistent chronic lesions, that can \nulcerate. Option A: Granuloma annular is most commonly found in children and females &lt;30 years. It \nmanifests as groups of 1-2mm papules that range from skin colored to violaceous, in an annular \narrangement over distal extremities. There is no confirmed association with diabetes. Option C: Reactive perforating collagenosis (folliculitis) has been reported in patients with \ndiabetes. It is attributed to collagen glycation. Option D: Rubeosis is a peculiar rosy reddening of the face, and sometimes hands and feet. In \nlongstanding diabetes, it is attributed to microangiopathy or decreased vascular tone.",

      "explanation": "Lupus pernio (cutaneous sarcoidosis) is the most likely diagnosis. Cutaneous sarcoidosis or presents as red■brown or red violaceous nodules or plaques, generally \nmultiple. It is usually asymptomatic. Diascopy reveals the subtle brown■yellow or ‘apple jelly’ \ncolor characteristic of granulomatous diseases but usually more opaque than in lupus vulgaris. At \ndiagnosis, at least 60% of patients have an increased serum angiotensin■converting enzyme level. Lupus pernio is the most distinctive manifestation of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Infiltrated \nerythematoviolaceous plaques involve the nose, cheeks, ears, lips, forehead, and fingers. On the \ncheeks, a prominent telangiectatic component is characteristic. The clinical appearance is due to \nthe presence of epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis. Lupus pernio is usually painless and, as it does not tend to ulcerate, is not as mutilating as lupus \nvulgaris.In more than half of cases, lupus pernio is associated with sarcoidosis of the upper \nrespiratory tract, especially in patients with involvement of the nasal rims.

Which of the following statements 581 \nSold by @itachibot regarding the cutaneous lesion is false?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Pathergy is seen in this condition",
        "b": "Cribriform or wrinkled paper scars are seen at the sites of healed ulcer",

        "d": "Treatment is with oral and topical antibiotics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). It is an autoinflammatory \ndisease (excessive response to an internal antigen) due to neutrophil dysfunction and hence \nantibiotics have no role in its management. It commonly presents on the anterior aspect of the lower limbs. The disease starts as a \npapule/pustule/bulla and rapidly progresses to an ulcerative lesion. The undermined edges of the \nulcer show neutrophilic infiltration. Deep ulcers heal with a characteristic cribriform or criss-cross \npattern of scarring. The pustular form of PG is associated mainly with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis \n&gt; Crohn's disease), the bullous form with hematological malignancies. Pathergy is the phenomenon whereby skin trauma provokes lesions at the site of injury. It is seen \nin pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease. The image below shows a large purulent ulcer with violaceous undermined borders which is a \nfeature of pyoderma gangrenosum. 595 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis indicates one of the diseases under neutrophilic \ndermatosis. Sweet's Syndrome presents as an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis which \nis characterized by non■itchy, sometimes tender, erythematous plaques and papules. The plaques are often oedematous and as the process develops they may become studded with \npseudovesicles or pseudopustules (no fluid collection present). The lesions in Sweet's Syndrome are most commonly distributed on the arms, upper body, head, \nand neck. An associated fever and peripheral leucocytosis are commonly seen and females are \nmore frequently affected. Histological findings include a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with edema. Three subgroups \nare recognized: • Classical • Malignancy-associated • Drug-induced Option A: Behcet's syndrome is also a neutrophilic dermatosis but presents as recurrent oral and \ngenital aphthous ulcers with an erythematous halo. Option B: Pyoderma gangrenosum, another neutrophilic dermatosis presents as painful ulcerative \nerythematous plaques or papules with undermined violaceous borders. Option C: Kasabach-Merritt's syndrome shows hemangiomas with thrombocytopenia. The image given below shows Sweet syndrome- pseudovesicles may occur within the \ninflammatory plaques. 596 \nSold by @itachibot",

The \nunderlying mechanism is thought to be an inflammatory process. They can be: • Idiopathic, due to exposure to cold that present within 12-24 hours. • Secondary to hematological disorder (paraproteinemia), autoimmune disease, viral hepatitis or \nmalignancy. The latest guidelines suggest patients presenting with new-onset, pernio-like lesions that have no \nother clear cause should be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n(SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are no treatment guidelines for \nCOVID-19-associated, pernio-like lesions of the feet or hands.
