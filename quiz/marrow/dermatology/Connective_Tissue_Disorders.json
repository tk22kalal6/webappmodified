      "explanation": "The given image shows nail-fold capillaroscopy findings. The image shows giant capillaries, \nhemorrhages, and reducing capillary density suggesting an active pattern in systemic sclerosis. The most important tests for systemic sclerosis are ANA reactivity and nail fold capillaroscopy. \nInvestigations to exclude or confirm other autoimmune rheumatic diseases including arthritis or \nother forms of connective tissue disease are also done. Nail-fold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive, easy, and safe diagnostic technique designed to evaluate \nthe general architecture of capillary rows and fine details of small vessels of the microcirculation \nin the nail fold. The most important indications for performing capillaroscopy include differential diagnosis of \nprimary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, as well as the assessment of scleroderma \nspectrum disorders. In systemic sclerosis, capillary abnormalities appear and evolve in a clearly defined sequence \ncalled the scleroderma pattern, which correlates with internal organ involvement. Nail fold capillaroscopy is also listed as a systemic sclerosis classification criterion recognized by \nthe European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). 544 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The history along with the image showing calcinosis cutis and sclerodactyly are suggestive of \nCREST syndrome. In limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis or CREST syndrome, anti-centromere antibodies are the \nmost commonly found antibodies. All other options are true for diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, not CREST syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Autoantibodies such as ANA, anti-histone, and anti■ssDNA may be present in morphea, but the \nsystemic sclerosis specific autoantibodies such as anti-topoisomerase, anti-centromere and \nanti■RNA polymerase are rarely found. Morphoea, a term used in preference to ‘localized scleroderma’, encompasses a group of related \nconditions characterized by varying degrees of sclerosis, fibrosis, and atrophy in the skin and \nsubcutaneous tissues. It is distinguished from systemic sclerosis by the absence of sclerodactyly and nail-fold capillary \nchanges. Overall, plaque morphea is the commonest subtype. Morphoea en coup de sabre: Blaschkoid linear induration affecting the face and scalp, may involve \nunderlying muscle, bone, eye, and the brain. 545 \nSold by @itachibot",
