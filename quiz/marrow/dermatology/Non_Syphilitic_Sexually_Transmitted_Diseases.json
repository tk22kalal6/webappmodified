      "explanation": "The given image shows esthiomene, a feature of lymphogranuloma venereum. In the tertiary stage of LGV, there is lymphatic obstruction due to chronic inflammation and \nfibrosis. This results in genital lymphoedema and inflammation which causes ulceration and \nchronic granulomatous fibrosis, resulting in esthiomene in women and elephantiasis in men.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The deformity shown in the above image depicts a penis that is twisted along its long axis, which \nis called saxophone penis. It is a late complication of lymphogranuloma venereum, penile \ntuberculosis, and primary lymphedema. It does not occur in donovanosis. It occurs as a complication of long-standing inflammation, which causes fibrosis of lymphatics \nand connective tissue. The dorsal surface of the penis has a poor blood supply compared to the \nventral surface and undergoes more fibrosis. This leads to a dorsal bend of the penis. Gonococcal urethritis can lead to periurethral abscesses, which result in urethral strictures. In \nmales, this may cause a saxophone penis deformity. 491 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Acidic pH is not a feature of the Amsel criteria, which are used for the diagnosis of bacterial \nvaginosis. 3 out of 4 of the following criteria are needed for a positive diagnosis: • Homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls. • Vaginal pH &gt; 4.5. • Positive whiff-amine test - Fishy odor when a drop of 10% KOH is added to vaginal discharge. • Clue cells on saline wet mount: Vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent coccobacilli at the \nedge of the cell. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by a reduction in lactobacilli, and an increase in anaerobic organisms \nsuch as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Prevotella species. Nugent scoring system is highly sensitive and is considered the gold standard for bacterial \nvaginosis. It is calculated using Gram-stained smear findings and observing the number of \nlactobacilli and morphology of anaerobes. High scores of 7–10 indicate bacterial vaginosis. 492 \nSold by @itachibot Genodermatoses & Nutritional Disorders",
