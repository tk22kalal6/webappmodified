      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Comedones are the specific lesions of acne vulgaris. Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Comedonal lesions are the \nearliest lesions of acne. They represent the keratin plugs of the pilosebaceous duct. When the keratin plug is inside the follicle, it is called a closed comedone (whitehead). When the keratin plug is exposed to the environment, it gets oxidized by the air and turns black \nwhich is known as open comedone (blackhead).",

      "explanation": "The patient comes with erythema and papules on facial convexities (central face), a characteristic \nfeature of acne rosacea. It is triggered by exposure to sunlight, spicy food, alcohol, or emotional disturbances. Patients \nalso develop telangiectasia later. They also have a tendency for developing rapid flushing due to \ntemperature change. Rosacea is more common in women of age 30-50 years. The innate immune response in rosacea appears to be altered. There is increased Toll■like \nreceptor 2 (TLR2) activity and increased protease activity. Demodex mite proliferation in the pilosebaceous follicles of the face has also been suggested as a \npossible aetiological factor in cutaneous and ocular inflammation. The pathogenesis of ocular \nrosacea seems to be closely associated with meibomian gland dysfunction. The table below shows the 4 subtypes and the corresponding treatment options.

Acné excoriée is regarded as a self■inflicted skin condition in which the sufferer compulsively \npicks real or imagined acne lesions predominantly on the face. It is mostly seen in adolescent \ngirls. Other psychiatric disorders associated with acne are: • Body dysmorphic disorder - Some patients have acne as their prime symptom. The perceived \nacne is out of proportion to physical signs. • Eating disorders - reported in anorexia nervosa. Acne itself may be a predisposing factor for \nanorexia in vulnerable teenaged age groups who adopt a diet in an attempt to control their acne. Option B: Acne fulminans or acne maligna is a rare and severe destructive form of acne presenting \nprimarily in adolescent males. It most frequently affects the trunk but can affect the face and \npresents acutely in association with systemic symptoms. Options C: Acne conglobata represents a rare and severe form of acne characterized by multiple \nand extensive inflammatory papules, tender nodules, and abscesses which commonly coalesce to \nform malodorous draining sinus tracts. Option D: Acne mechanica describes acne that occurs at the site of repeated mechanical trauma \nand/or frictional obstruction of the pilosebaceous outlet resulting in comedo formation.

      "explanation": "Glycolic acid is the preferred chemical peel agent in dark-skinned individuals. Dark skin (Fitzpatrick type IV to VI) has a tendency for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation \n(PIH) after procedures like lasers and chemical peel. Deep chemical peels cannot be used in \ndark-skinned patients. Even medium-depth peels need to be used with extreme caution. Chemical peels are believed to promote desquamation which reduces corneocyte cohesion and \nkeratinocyte plugging, so enabling the extrusion of inflammatory contents. Light chemical peels \nare used with the aim of helping to remove comedones as well as superficial scarring and \nhyperpigmentation. Other peeling agents are: • Pyruvic acid • Lactic acid • Maleic acid • Citric acid 91 \nSold by @itachibot • Tartaric acid • Mandelic acid • Jessener's Solution - lactic acid + salicyclic acid + resorcinol",

It mostly \naffects men past middle age. Patients seek advice because of the distorted appearance of the \nenlarged nose, or obstruction in breathing and vision. Rhinophyma may be diagnosed clinically, but a skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. On \nhistology, rhinophyma shows sebaceous gland hypertrophy, hyperplasia and fibrosis.
