      "explanation": "The image shows punched-out anesthetic lesions characteristic of the borderline spectrum of \nleprosy. The most unstable form of leprosy is the borderline-borderline type. This type is rarely seen as it rapidly upgrades towards tuberculoid or downgrades towards \nlepromatous, based on the immune status of the individual. However, clinical features may lag \nbehind the immunological and histological findings. This leads to numerous skin lesions and with \nfeatures of both ends of the spectrum. Lepromatous and tuberculoid types are the most stable.

Histoid leprosy is a rare type of multibacillary leprosy where the bacilli are confined to the lesions \nand hence, globi are relatively few. The name arises from the microscopic finding \nof spindle-shaped histiocytes forming interlacing bands and whorls.

The likely drug used in this immunosuppressed young woman is clofazimine, \nwhich causes deposition of crystals in the intestinal mucosa, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen, not \nrenal tubules. Clofazimine is a brick red, fat■soluble crystalline dye with a weak bactericidal action against M. \nleprae through an unknown mechanism. It also has an anti■inflammatory effect, which is useful \nin the management of ENL reactions. 340 \nSold by @itachibot The most noticeable side effect is skin discoloration, ranging from red to purple-black, the degree \nof discoloration depends on the dose and amount of leprous infiltration. It generally fades within \n6–12 months after stopping clofazimine, however, traces of discoloration may remain even for up \nto 4 years. Urine, sputum, and sweat may turn pink. It also produces scaling and ichthyosis of the shin and forearms. Crystal deposition in the wall of the small bowel occurs as the drug is excreted into the bile.

At \nend of 21 days, if there is a nodule &gt;5mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. The test is used for the following purposes: • To classify the lesions of leprosy patients. • To assess the prognosis and response to treatment. • To assess the resistance of individuals to leprosy. • To verify the identity of candidate lepra bacilli. Option A: Sensory testing is useful to detect hypoesthesia and nerve involvement of leprosy.
