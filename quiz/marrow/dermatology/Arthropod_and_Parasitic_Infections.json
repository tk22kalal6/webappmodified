The scaly patch on the \nleft was caused by the scratching and it marks the mite's entry point into the skin. The mite has \nburrowed to the top-right, where it can be seen as a dark spot at the end. Burrow is the \ncharacteristic lesion of scabies. Scabies is an ectoparasitic infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The characteristic symptoms include intense itching and superficial burrows. In most people, the \ntrails of the burrowing mites appear brownish linear or s-shaped tracks in the skin and occur as a \nresult of excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis. These are found in the webspaces, feet, \nventral wrists, elbows, back, breasts, buttocks, and external genitals. Larva currens and cutaneous larva migrans presents as pruritic erythematous papule at the site of \npenetration of the hookworms with an erythematous serpiginous larva track. Pediculosis lesions present as erythematous papules with maculae cerulae.",
