      "explanation": "A painless and indurated ulcer in a sex worker is characteristic of primary syphilis. It is caused by \nTreponema pallidum. Treponema is a corkscrew organism. The coils are very close and regular with around 7 to 8 coils \nper diameter of a red blood corpuscle. It contains a flagellum and its graceful movements are \npathognomonic. It rotates along its long axis and appears to screw slowly forwards and \nbackwards. Option A: Listeria is a rod-shaped bacterium. 460 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Helicobacter pylori is spiral or rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium. It■■ has two to \nseven unipolar flagella. It is smaller than spirochetes. Option D: Leptospira is also spiral and highly motile. They can be distinguished from other \nspirochetes by their unique question mark hook at the end of the bacterium. It is more tightly \nwound than Treponema with 18 or more coils per cell.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a painless ulcer with indurated margins is suggestive of primary \nsyphilis. It is Secondary Syphilis that causes non-scarring alopecia that appear as moth-eaten \npatches if left untreated The incubation period of syphilis is 9-90 days and varies inversely with the size of the Spirochaete \ninoculum. Primary chancre: Painless, indurated, button-like ulcer with painless lymphadenopathy. Secondary syphilis: Roseolar rash is the earliest sign, but it is hard to see in dark-skinned people. \nWhen it fades, it leaves depigmented spots. This is called the necklace of Venus as it commonly \noccurs around the neck. Generalized papular lesions also occur. Sometimes these papules form a \nline along the hair margin called Corona Veneris or crown of Venus. In latent syphilis, there are no features of active disease, but serological tests are positive. It can \nlast up to 20 years. Tertiary syphilis: Begins with skin nodules or the characteristic gumma which occurs 3-10 years \nafter infection. The name arises from the necrotic center which may turn into a slimy, stringy \nmass.",

      "explanation": "The Dory flop sign is described in an uncircumcised male with an indurated lesion of primary \nsyphilis on the underside of the coronal sulcus. Here, prepucial retraction causes the foreskin to \nflip suddenly. Hence it would only be seen in the middle-aged man with the indurated lesion on \nhis penis. The Dory flop sign can help distinguish chancres from other nonindurated causes of genital ulcer \ndisease, such as Herpes simplex virus infection and chancroid. It is named after the movement of a dory, a small wooden fishing boat, which flips suddenly when \noverturned. Option A: This young woman has granuloma inguinale, which is a non-indurated lesion. Option C: This circumcised teenager has herpes genitalis. Option D: Though this lady has an indurated lesion (chancre), the dory flop sign can be \ndemonstrated only in uncircumcised males. 461 \nSold by @itachibot",

The features of secondary syphilis include the following: • Macular / roseolar rash is the earliest rash. It fades leaving hypopigmentation around the neck \ncalled leucoderma syphiliticum or necklace of Venus. • Papular rash involves the palms and soles. • In later stages, nummular lesions with scales are seen which resemble psoriasis.

Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum. It is usually acquired through sexual contact and \nco-exists with other sexually transmitted diseases except for congenital syphilis. Primary syphilis commonly presents as a papule on external genitalia that rapidly ulcerates to \nform a primary chancre. Secondary syphilis is the stage when generalized manifestations of syphilis appear on the skin and \nmucous membranes. Serological tests in immunocompetent patients are always positive. Tertiary syphilis commonly presents as superficial or nodular punched out ulcers or \ngummas(granulomas appearing as cutaneous plaques or nodules with central ulceration) Late syphilis is the stage when there are no clinical stigmata of active disease but serological \ntesting for the disease is positive Clinical features: • Primary genital sores appear 3 weeks after exposure • Enlarged inguinal lymph nodes are palpable 5 weeks after exposure • Macular rash appears 8 weeks after exposure • Condylomata appears 6 months after exposure Serological testing is done using a standard non-treponemal antibody test (VDRL, RPR) and a \nspecific treponemal antibody test(TPHA, FTA-ABS). 464 \nSold by @itachibot Microscopically, Treponema pallidum is identified with a characteristic wave-like appearance on \ndarkfield microscopy. Parenteral penicillin G is the drug of choice for all stages of syphilis. If the patient has a history of drug allergies, it is advisable to keep the patient under observation \nfor 15 to 20 mins after injection.
