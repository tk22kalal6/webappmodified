The pruritis occurring in obstructive jaundice is due to cholestasis. The bile salts deposit in the \nskin, causing saponification of the fat surrounding the nerve endings. This leaves the nerves \nexposed, producing the sensation of a severe itch. It involves loss of skin substance till the level of the epidermis or upper dermis. Almost all pruritic \nconditions (except lichen planus) cause excoriation. The image given below shows excoriations. 61 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The test depicted in the given image is diascopy. It involves pressing a glass slide or a stiff, clear, colorless piece of plastic onto the skin to cause \nblanching by compressing blood out of small vessels. This allows other colors to be evaluated. Some uses of diascopy are as follows: • Apple jelly nodules - Yellow-brown lesions seen in lupus vulgaris and sarcoidosis. • Spider naevi - Compression of radiating arterioles is noted. • Differentiation of erythema (disappears) and purpura (remains unaltered). The image given below shows apple-jelly nodules on diascopy. 70 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given image shows a photo-patch test. Skin reaction is seen on the uncovered side that \nis exposed to UV rays. Photo-patch test is useful in the diagnosis of photosensitive rashes and photoallergic contact \ndermatitis that are typically localized to the sun-exposed areas of the skin. UV light is used at a dose sufficient to trigger the photoallergic response, without causing a false \npositive phototoxic reaction. It is performed like a conventional patch test, except two sets of \nallergens are applied over the back. The control set of allergens and the rest of the skin \nare covered with an opaque material. The patient is positioned 15 cm from a UV lamp and the test \nsite is irradiated with UV light. This test is best read after 48 hours. In the case of a positive test indicating photoallergy, the \nexposed side shows a reaction. 72 \nSold by @itachibot",
