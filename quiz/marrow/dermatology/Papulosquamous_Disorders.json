      "explanation": "Basal epidermal cell degeneration/destruction is characteristically seen in lichen planus. It occurs because of the basal keratinocytes being destroyed by dermal CD8+ T \nlymphocytes. Degenerating/apoptotic basal epidermal cells are known as colloid bodies \n(cytoid/Civatte bodies), which may appear singly or in clumps. Other histopathological features of lichen planus: • Hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis • Pigment incontinence - melanin gradually moves into the dermis as a result of keratinocyte \ndegeneration • Dermal melanin is then engulfed by the macrophages forming melanophages \n(melanin-containing macrophages). • The degeneration leads to the formation of spaces in the epidermis known as Max-Joseph \nspaces. • The rete ridges are pointed at their lower end giving them a saw-toothed appearance. • Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate is present at the dermoepidermal junction.
