Smallpox is caused by the variola virus and was eradicated from the world in May 1980. Fever, headache, and malaise appear 10-14 days after infection. Lesions are monomorphic (lesions \nwithin an area are at the same stage) and initially vesicular/pustular which then dry, scab over, \nand finally, heal.

      "explanation": "The above image shows shiny, pearly white, umbilicated papules which are suggestive \nof molluscum contagiosum. The peak incidence is between 2-5 years. The incubation period is around 14 days-6 months. It is \nmainly caused by type-I molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV-1) in children and type-II (MCV■2) \nin adults and HIV patients. New lesions develop along the line of trauma (pseudo-Koebner \nphenomenon). Sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum may be present over the genital area. Microscopic examination of the lesions shows eosinophilic inclusions called Henderson-Patterson \nbodies. The condition is usually self-limiting but treatment is required for non-resolving symptomatic \nlesions. Destruction with cantharidin, trichloroacetic acid, diluted liquefied phenol, or surgical \nremoval are a few options. 384 \nSold by @itachibot",

The most common cause of which worldwide is coxackievirus A16. Spread is by droplets or faecal contamination and the incubation period is 7 days. The fever is \ngenerally mild, and is followed by the appearance of lesions. The characteristic lesions are slightly \noval, with a grey blister roof and a narrow rim of erythema.

Recurrent herpetic lesions are vesicular and ulcerative and tend to occur in the \nsame region. Treatment: Oral acyclovir 200 mg and topical 5% acyclovir can be used for treatment. In case of \nresistance to acyclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir can be used.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of active primary genital herpes in the mother. In the case of \nneonatal transmission, the mortality is high. Herpes simplex infection of a baby within 28 days of birth is called neonatal herpes. HSV-2 is \nmore commonly implicated than HSV-1. It is usually acquired vertically from the mother or \npostnatally by contact with non■genital sites. Features of neonatal herpes: • Vesicular eruption • Inflamed and ulcerated mucosae • Disseminated disease: • Lethargy • Seizures • Respiratory distress • Hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis • Thrombocytopenia. Primary genital herpes infection in the mother at the time of delivery is associated with a high risk \nof transmission to the baby during vaginal delivery. Hence cesarean section is indicated and \nprophylactic aciclovir should be considered for the neonate. Neonatal herpes is treated with high■dose intravenous acyclovir followed by oral acyclovir for 6 \nmonths. 386 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows neonatal herpes.

      "explanation": "The above image showing multiple vesicular lesions on the trunk is suggestive of chickenpox or \nvaricella caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is non-contagious after the lesions have crusted. Most infections occur before the age of 5 but can occur in older children and adults. The lesions \ndevelop in 3-5 crops and are polymorphic (present at different stages in each site). In 2–4 days, a \ndry crust forms leaving a shallow pink depression which, in the absence of secondary infection, \nheals without scarring. Most common complication is secondary bacterial infection. Varicella confers lasting immunity \nand second attacks are uncommon.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The above image shows unilateral, painful, grouped vesicles in a single dermatome suggestive of \nherpes zoster or shingles. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved in \nshingles. Herpes zoster/shingles is an acute cutaneous segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent \nvaricella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential \nbefore zoster can occur. The first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. Occasionally, \nthe pain may not be followed by the eruption (‘zoster sine eruptione’). The patients are infectious, \nboth from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx. The most commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt; \ncervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The incidence of ophthalmic zoster increase with age. \nThe posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a variant of zoster involving the ophthalmic division of the \ntrigeminal nerve (V1). Herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome is another variant involving \nthe geniculate ganglion and presents with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, otalgia and vesicles over \nexternal ear. Zoster is a self-limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and \npost-herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild \ninfections. Indications for antivirals in VZV (Acyclovir 800 mg): • Painful zoster infections in adults • Facial zoster at any age • Immunocompromised",

      "explanation": "Post-herpetic neuralgia is most frequent when the trigeminal nerve is involved. The commonest and most intractable complication of zoster is post-herpetic neuralgia. It \nis generally defined as persistence or recurrence of pain more than 1-3 months after the onset of \nzoster. The pain may be a continuous burning pain with hyperaesthesia or a spasmodic shooting \ntype or pruritic paraesthesia may also occur. Allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuous \nstimuli) is often the most distressing symptom and occurs in most people with post■herpetic \nneuralgia.

      "explanation": "The given image shows cryotherapy which is used for the treatment of certain conditions like \nwarts. The main disadvantage of this procedure is pain. Cryotherapy is a physician-administered treatment modality and it uses dimethyl ether spray, \ncarbon dioxide snow, or liquid nitrogen to produce cold thermal damage to the skin. Liquid nitrogen produces the coldest freeze and is most commonly used in practice. It is applied \nusing a cotton wool bud or a cryospray until a rim of iced tissue (seen as a white discoloration) \ndevelops around the lesion. The freeze is maintained for 5–30 sec. Scarring is unlikely with \nfreezing times under 30 secs. Cryotherapy is considered relatively safer in pregnancy.",

It evolves in three phases: • First phase - sudden onset diffuse and macular, asymptomatic erythema of the cheeks, (slapped \ncheek). Prodromal symptoms may or may not be present. • Second phase - begins after 1–4 days, with discrete erythematous macules and papules on the \nproximal extremities and later the trunk. • Third phase - Recurring stage, the eruption is greatly reduced or invisible, only to recur after the \npatient is exposed to heat or sunlight, or in response to crying or exercise. Only about 7% of children with erythema infectiosum have arthralgias, whereas 80% of \nadults have joint involvement. 392 \nSold by @itachibot",

It begins with a prodrome of pain, burning, and tingling followed by the \nappearance of erythematous papules. The papules then become vesicular and may ulcerate. It is treated with oral acyclovir 200 mg and 5% topical acyclovir.
