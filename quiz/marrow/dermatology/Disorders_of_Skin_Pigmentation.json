      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The ratio of the epidermal melanin unit is 36 keratinocytes : 1 melanocyte. The color of the skin is due to the pigment melanin synthesized by melanocytes. Melanocytes are \ndendritic cells derived from neural crest cells and are present in the epidermis' stratum basale. \nEach melanocyte synthesizes melanin and packs it in cell organelles to form melanosomes. These \nmelanosomes are transferred through dendritic processes to 36 keratinocytes forming the \n‘epidermal melanin’ unit.",

Well-defined irregular hypopigmented macules with an absence of melanocytes are seen. \nLeucotrichia is associated with the depigmented macules. Small spots of hyperpigmentation are \nalso seen within hypopigmented patches or on normal skin. It is often associated with a V-shaped \nleucoderma on the mid-forehead. Epidermal cell or skin grafting is the treatment. Piebaldism can be distinguished from vitiligo because of the neonatal presence of white patches.

It is an acquired condition resulting from the autoimmune destruction of \ndopa-positive melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. Vitiligo can begin at any age but in the majority of cases becomes apparent in the third \ndecade. The prevalence is most probably the same in both sexes or a slight female preponderance.

The most frequently-used oral 163 \nSold by @itachibot psoralens are 8■methoxy psoralen (8■MOP) and 5■methoxy psoralen (5■MOP). The mechanisms of action of PUVA: • Inhibition of DNA replication - DNA cross■linking by psoralen photoadducts • Langerhans cell depletion • Immunosuppressive effects on T■lymphocyte function • Stimulation of melanogenesis • Migration and the restoration of Th1›/regulatory T-cell imbalance in psoriasis Indications of PUVA therapy: • Psoriasis • Atopic eczema • Vitiligo • Polymorphic light eruption • Cutaneous T cell lymphoma The UVB part of the spectrum is 280-320 nm. Lamps utilizing the 311-313 nm frequencies are \ncalled narrow■band UV (NBUVB). UVB phototherapy has anti■inflammatory, \nimmunosuppressive, and cytotoxic properties.

Chloasma is very common in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes. It is due to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, stimulating the activity of melanocytes. \nHistopathology shows no increase in number but hyper-functional melanocytes. It resolves on its \nown after pregnancy. Melasma is the most common cause of chronic facial melanosis. It is manifested by \nhyperpigmented macules that become more pronounced after sun exposure. Hypermelanosis \naffects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and chin. It is more common in women \nbetween 20-40 years. It is frequently seen in women on oral contraceptives. Wood's lamp examination is useful to differentiate the level of pigmentation and \ntreatment response: • Epidermal melasma- shows enhanced color contrast • Dermal melasma- shows less color contrast (more resistant to treatment) • Mixed melasma. Melasma is more chronic and requires treatment with depigmenting agents like: • Kligman's triple combination - topical hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid compound \ncream (first line) • Hydroquinone (reduces tyrosinase activity) • Kojic acid (tyrosinase inhibitor) 176 \nSold by @itachibot • Chemical peels",
