Impetigo is a contagious, superficial pyogenic infection of the skin. The face, especially around the \nnose, mouth, and limbs, is most commonly affected, but lesions may occur anywhere. Superficial intraepidermal bullae are formed as desmoglein-1 is targetted by the exfoliative toxins \nproduced by S. aureus. After the bullae rupture, they leave behind varnish crust. Central healing \nand peripheral extension may give rise to circinate lesions which are eroded. Treatment involves topical fucidin or mupirocin, retapamulin in resistant cases.
