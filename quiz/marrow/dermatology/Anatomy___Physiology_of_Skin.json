      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Development of skin includes activation of Wnt signaling. The lack of Wnt signaling promotes \nthe neural fate of the neuroectoderm cells. A single layer of neuroectoderm forms the nervous system or the skin epithelium depending on \nthe molecular signals it receives. Activation of Wnt signaling blocks the response of ectoderm \nto fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the cells express bone morphogenetic proteins \n(BMPs). This leads to the epidermal fate of the neuroectoderm. 13 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The ratio of type-I to type-III collagen in the adult human skin is 8:1. Type-I collagen is the predominant collagen in the human dermis. Type-III collagen is known to \npredominate in the human skin during embryonic development, but during the early postnatal \nperiod, type-I collagen synthesis accelerates. This results in the ratio of type-I to type-III collagen \nin the adult human skin being approximately 8:1.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The area marked is the reticular dermis. It is made up of dense irregular connective tissue. It is found in the regions that are under considerable mechanical stress and where protection is \ngiven to ensheathed organs. It is usually present in: • Reticular dermis • Superficial connective tissue sheaths of the muscle and nerves • Adventitia of large vessels • Capsules of various organs and glands (e.g., testis, sclera, periosteum, perichondrium) On the other hand, dense regular collagen fibers are found in tendons. 24 \nSold by @itachibot 25 \nSold by @itachibot Dermatopathology of Skin Lesions",
