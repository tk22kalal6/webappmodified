It may also be caused by M. furfur and M. sympodialis. The KOH mount reveals fungal hyphae that are short and thick (like spaghetti or banana) and a \nlarge number of variously sized spores (like meatballs or grapes) referred to as 'spaghetti &amp; \nmeatballs' or 'bananas &amp; grapes'. Option A: Pityriasis alba is not a fungal infection, associated with eczema. Option C: In tinea corporis infection, microconidia and macroconidia are seen under a KOH \nmount. Option D: In candidiasis, spores and pseudohyphae of candida are seen in the KOH mount.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows multiple hypopigmented macules and patches with fine scales \n(branny/furfuraceous) suggestive of tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor). Hypopigmentation is due to azelaic acid produced by Malassezia species that causes competitive \ninhibition of tyrosinase and a direct cytotoxic effect on hyperactive melanocytes. Under Wood's lamp examination, lesions show a pale yellow fluorescence. Besnier's sign (coup d'ongle sign or scratch sign or stroke of the nail): When the fine scales are not \nvisible, an important diagnostic clue may be the loosening of barely perceptible scales with a \nfingernail, which is called the scratch sign. The most commonly affected site is the upper trunk. Relapse is very common. First-line treatment: • Topical azoles twice daily for 2–3 weeks • Terbinafine 1% cream twice daily for 2–3 weeks • Ketoconazole shampoo twice weekly for 2-3 weeks • 2.5% selenium shampoo alternative days for 2-3 weeks Second-line treatment: Oral itraconazole, 200 mg daily for 5 days The image below shows the pale yellow fluorescence of Tinea versicolor under Wood's lamp.",

Approach to the case: The patient hails from a kala-azar endemic zone—Bihar. The rash appears 1-2 years after a history \nof prolonged fever, which suggests visceral leishmaniasis. There are 2 other differentials—leprosy \nand tinea versicolor. • The presence of hypopigmented macules over the trunk and face, suggests a differential of \nleprosy, but the nerves and sensations are normal, hence ruling it out. • There is no scaling visible in the lesions, ruling out tinea versicolor. In kala-azar, after a variable period of years or months, diffuse nodulation begins to develop in \nthese macules. The rash is progressive over many years and seldom heals spontaneously. As it \nmay persist for up to 20 years, these patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection.
