Mycosis fungoides is characterized by erythematous, polymorphic patches and plaques which \nare fine, scaly, and slightly atrophic (wrinkled) usually involving limb/girdle, breast, and especially \nthe buttock area. Analysis of TCR genes is now a standard approach that has diagnostic, prognostic, and \ntherapeutic implications.

      "explanation": "Extracorporeal photopheresis is a systemic therapy used for mycosis fungoides. The procedure consists of three stages: • Leukapheresis 561 \nSold by @itachibot • Photoactivation (with psoralen and UVA) • Reinfusion of buffy coat After exposure to UVA, psoralen binds covalently to DNA in separated leukocytes leading to cell \ncycle arrest and apoptosis. These apoptotic leukocytes when reintroduced into the peripheral \ncirculation are phagocytosed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs then produce tumor \nsuppressor cells against the malignant cells responsible for mycosis fungoides. Skin-directed therapy is preferred in the early stages whereas advanced stages require systemic \ntherapy. Skin-directed therapies: • Topical corticosteroids • Topical chemotherapy: nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine) and carmustine (BCNU) • Topical rexinoids • Phototherapy and photochemotherapy (PUVA) • Radiotherapy and electron beam therapy: Mycosis fungoides and variants are highly \nradiosensitive Systemic therapies: • Immunotherapy: Pegylated IFN■ • Oral Retinoids and rexinoids • Combination therapy • Systemic chemotherapy • Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) • Toxin therapies: Denileukin diftitox • Monoclonal antibody therapy • Histone deacetylase inhibitors. 562 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The above image depicts melanoma. Only about 20–25% of melanomas arise from pre-existing \nnevus others arise de novo. The number of naevi will be proportional to the risk. Risk factors for melanoma are as follows: • Family history- a positive family history is associated with a two-fold increased risk of melanoma • Melanocytic nevus- may be congenital nevus or atypical/dysplastic nevus • Genetic mutations- mutations of CDKN2A gene (major susceptibility), MC1R gene (moderate \nsusceptibility), TYR gene (low susceptibility) • Skin pigmentation and tanning abilities- skin type I in Fitzpatrick’s classification has two-fold \nincreased risk as compared to type IV. • Sun exposure- intermittent sun exposure during childhood is considered to be an important risk \nfactor. • Artificial sources of UV- sunbeds and therapeutic UV increase the relative risk for the \ndevelopment of melanoma.",

      "explanation": "The above image shows a flat, brownish, irregularly shaped lesion suggestive of melanoma. The \ncyclin■dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A), located on chromosome 9p21, is the \nbest established high■risk locus for melanoma susceptibility. CDKN2A mutations are found in approximately 40% of individuals with familial melanoma. In melanoma, tumor suppressors that play a protective role against melanoma are mutated. \nCDKN2A encodes via alternative splicing for two proteins involved in cell cycle regulation: 569 \nSold by @itachibot p16/Ink4a and p14/Arf, both act as tumor suppressors through the Rb and p53 cancer pathways, \nrespectively.",
