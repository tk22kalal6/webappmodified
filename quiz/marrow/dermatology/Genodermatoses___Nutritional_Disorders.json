      "explanation": "The neonate is most likely suffering from Harlequin ichthyosis, as evidenced by the presence of \narmor-like skin. It is the most devastating type of autosomal recessive congenital icthyosis. It is due to mutations \nof the ABCA12 gene. The gene plays a role in lamellar body formation in the stratum granulosum \nand desquamation of the stratum corneum. It presents in the neonatal period with armor■like skin (truncal plates with fissuring). It can \nimpair body movement and breathing. Bilateral ectropion and eclabium are present. Respiratory \nproblems are the major cause of death due to alveolar collapse in neonates. They are also prone to \nskin and lung infections. Defective lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum seen in electron microscopy are pathognomic \nof Harlequin ichthyosis. In early life, constant supportive care is required. Treatment includes \nmoisturizing cream, antibiotics, etretinate, or retinoids. Other options - Option A) Ichthyosis vulgaris - The most common type of ichthyosis, involving mutations in \nfilaggrin protein. Filaggrin is an epidermal protein that helps retain moisture in the stratum \ncorneum. Ichthyosis is not present at birth but develops during the first months of life. The \nscaling usually involves the extensor surfaces of the extremities with flexural sparing. They are \nstrongly correlated with atopic dermatitis and other forms of atopy such as allergic rhinitis, \nasthma, etc. Option B) Bathing suit ichthyosis is a type of congenital ichthyosis caused by mutations in the \nTGM1 gene. It presents as a collodion baby at birth where the neonate is encased in a shiny \nparchment■like membrane. Shedding of the collodion membrane is followed by the development \nof large dark grey/brownish scales affecting the trunk and the scalp, but sparing the face and \nextremities resembling a bathing suit. The disease tends to become worse in the summer months \nand improves in winter. 518 \nSold by @itachibot Option D) Lamellar ichthyosis is also a congenital ichthyosis, involving mutations in the TGM1 \ngene. It is characterized by large plate■like dark■brown hyperkeratoses covering the entire body \nwith mild palmoplantar involvement. The extreme spectrum of lamellar ichthyosis is congenital \nichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE) which is similar to erythroderma seen in psoriasis.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows pili torti seen in Menke's syndrome or trichopoliodystrophy or steely hair \ndisease. Pili torti refers to hair showing 180-degree twists under the microscope. Scalp and eyebrow hair \nappear short, sparse, lustreless, tangled, and depigmented. Hair changes can be the first sign of \ndisease at 1–2 months of age. It is an X■linked recessive disorder. At 2–3 months of age, children with Menke's disease present \nwith: • Loss of developmental milestones • Hypotonia • Seizures • Failure to thrive • Cherubic appearance - depressed nasal bridge, pudgy cheeks, ‘cupids bow’ upper lip, and doughy \nskin. Option A: In kwashiorkor, hair develops a lustreless, red■brown color that may show alternation \nwith more normal color; this so■called ‘flag sign’ corresponds to alternating periods of significant \nundernutrition and improved nutrition. Option B: Selenium deficiency presents as brittle hair and may be associated with exfoliative \ndermatitis on the scalp. Option D: In zinc deficiency, hair is dry and brittle, and large areas of alopecia may arise.",
