      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The image shows multiple wheals in acute spontaneous urticaria. It is mediated by immunological \nand non-immunological mechanisms. The primary mechanism of urticaria is mast cell degranulation triggered by immune \n(IgE-mediated) or non-immune (cytokines, complement) mechanisms, which cause the release of \nhistamine. This increases vascular permeability and vasodilation. It can be acute (&lt;6 weeks) or chronic (&gt;6 weeks). Acute spontaneous urticaria can be \ntriggered: • Hypersensitivity • Viral infections • Food allergy • Drug allergy • Blood transfusions. However, the actual cause is unknown in nearly 60% of cases. It is characterized by wheals, which are evanescent, well■defined, pink, or pale swellings due to \nreversible dermal edema. It usually fades within hours without pigmentation. Wheals are usually \nvery itchy and associated with a surrounding red flare when they arise. They may occur anywhere on the body, including the scalp, palms, and soles, in variable numbers \nand sizes.",

It refers to the development of urticaria and \nerythema around the lesions after mild trauma, including scratching or rubbing of the lesion. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common pattern of cutaneous mastocytosis, which occurs due to \nan increased number of mast cells in the skin. It presents with reddish-brown or pale \nmaculopapules, plaques, nodules in symmetric distribution, sparing the palms and soles. Darier's sign is not specific for mastocytosis as it is also rarely seen in juvenile xanthogranuloma \nand acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Note: Pseudo-Darier sign is seen in soft tissue hamartoma, with piloerection and transient \ninduration after stroking the lesions.

Type I HAE is the \nmost common form (85%). There are three types of hereditary angioedema (HAE): • Type 1 (85%): C1INH deficiency • Type 2 (15%): Dysfunction of C1-INH, but normal levels • Type 3 (rare) : Normal C1-INH levels and function HAE occurs due to a mutation in the SERPING1 gene, which codes for the C1 esterase inhibitor \n(C1INH). It is also called angioneurotic edema or Quincke's disease. C1INH enzyme normally inhibits the following: • Complement system • Kallikrein system • Factor XII or Hageman factor In HAE, loss of C1INH activity leads to loss of inhibition of these above processes.
