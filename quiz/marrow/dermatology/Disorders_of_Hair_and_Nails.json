      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "80-90% of hair follicles at a given time are in the anagen phase. The hair cycle has three phases: Anagen: It refers to the period of active hair growth. Anagen can continue for several years and the \nduration of this phase is responsible for determining the final length of the hair. Normally, \n80–90% of hair follicles on the human scalp are in anagen at any one time. It can be identified by \nthe presence of angulated roots. Catagen: 114 \nSold by @itachibot At the end of anagen, epithelial cell division slows and stops, and the follicle enters an \ninvolutionary phase known as catagen. The proximal end of the hair shaft keratinizes to form a \nclub-shaped structure and the lower part of the follicle involutes by apoptosis. It lasts for about 3 \nweeks. Telogen: It is the resting phase between catagen and the next anagen. Clubbing becomes more prominent. \nIt lasts for about 3 months. Club hair is eventually shed through an active process called exogen. In the human scalp, hair follicles may remain in a state of latency, also known as kenogen, for a \nprolonged period after the club hair is shed.",

      "explanation": "This man has male-pattern hair loss. Finasteride selectively inhibits type 2 5 ■reductase within \nthe hair follicle. Hence, it is used in the treatment of male-pattern hair loss. The 5 ■reductase enzyme converts testosterone to the more potent form of dihydrotestosterone \n(DHT). 5 ■Reductase exists in 3 isoforms. Type 1 and 3 are widely distributed in the skin and not \ninvolved in hair growth. 115 \nSold by @itachibot Type 2 is present in androgen-responsive tissues such as the dermal papillae of the hair follicle, \nprostate, epididymides, and seminal vesicles. Type 2 5 ■reductase also plays a key role in \nregulating androgen-dependent hair growth. Hair growth in the following areas is androgen dependent: • Beard, chest, and extremity hair in males • Scalp, pubic, and axillary hair in both sexes Male-pattern hair loss: Male-pattern hair loss causes thinning of the vertex and an M-shaped receding hairline, as shown \nbelow. High levels of circulating androgens stimulate hair loss in certain sites by a process called \nminiaturization. Finasteride reverses this process.",

      "explanation": "The dermal papilla is the primary target of the action of androgen in the hair. This is because the \ndermal papillae have two important features, namely • Androgen receptors which are present only in dermal papillae • Expression of 5 ■reductase type 2 which regulates androgen-dependent hair growth. Androgens have the following effects on hair growth. • It increases the number of cells in the dermal papilla which causes hair follicle growth and \nresults in pubertal hair growth. • It causes miniaturization of the follicle in other susceptible sites which leads to male pattern hair \nloss. Finasteride inhibits conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the dermal papillae. This \nprevents miniaturization and further development of alopecia. 116 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of male pattern androgenetic alopecia. Finasteride is not the \nfirst line treatment in women. Finasteride use in pregnancy can lead to teratogenic effects on male fetuses. Androgenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by \nfollicles and miniaturization. It is of two types , male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Male \npattern hair loss may occur in female &amp; vice versa is also true. Male pattern hair loss causes \nfrontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex. Miniaturization refers to a reduction in the size of follicles until it leaves behind a remnant called \nstelae or streamers. Elastic staining of the stelae shows Arao-Perkin's bodies. DHT is a more potent form of testosterone. It is responsible for follicular regression and thus \ncauses androgenic alopecia. Finasteride inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT \nand hence is used for treatment. Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator. It is used orally to treat severe hypertension. When used as a \nhair lotion, it prolongs the anagen phase and slows down or prevents hair loss. Drugs used to treat \nmale pattern baldness: • Minoxidil lotion • 5-alpha reductase antagonist - Finasteride Drugs used to treat female pattern baldness: • Minoxidil lotion • Anti-androgens - spironolactone, flutamide, and cyproterone acetate 117 \nSold by @itachibot",

Usually, vertex baldness is absent and frontal hairline is \nmaintained. Male pattern hair loss (MPHL) involves vertex baldness and frontal hairline recession.

      "explanation": "Chemotherapy causes hair loss known as anagen effluvium. It is due to the disruption of the anagen or proliferating phase of the hair cycle. Hair shedding \ntypically occurs within 1–3 weeks and it is complete within 1–2 months after the initiation of \nchemotherapy. Most important drugs implicated in the order of decreasing frequency of association causing \nanagen effluvium: • Anti-microtubule agents (e.g., paclitaxel) • Topo-isomerase inhibitors (e.g., doxorubicin) • Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) • Anti-metabolites (e.g., 5-fluorouracil) Option A: Alopecia areata causes patchy, well-circumscribed hair loss, as shown below. 119 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Telogen effluvium is an acute-onset diffuse hair loss that occurs 2–3 months after a \ntriggering event such as high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation or haemorrhage.

It is an acute-onset scalp hair \nloss that occurs 2–3 months after a triggering event such as high fever, surgical trauma, sudden \nstarvation, or hemorrhage. It refers to an increase in the shedding of telogen club hairs due to premature termination of the \nanagen (proliferative) phase of the hair cycle following a period of stress. Chronic diffuse telogen hair loss refers to telogen hair shedding persisting &gt; 6 months. Causes \nof chronic diffuse telogen hair loss are: • Thyroid disorders (Both hyper- and hypothyroidism) • Severe iron deficiency anemia, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and malnutrition. Telogen gravidarum refers to telogen hair loss seen 2–3 months after childbirth. The circulating \nplacental estrogen during pregnancy prolongs anagen phase.

The characteristic features are, • Varying lengths of hair and absence of complete hair loss in the patch • Orentreich or Friar Tuck or Tonsure sign: Loss of central area (easier to pull) and sparing of \nmargins of the scalp. • Broken hair shafts • No scarring. Histopathological examination shows, • No inflammation • Peribulbar, intraepithelial and perifollicular hemorrhages • Intrafollicular pigment casts. Trichotillosis is the newer term as it is not a 'mania'. It shares some features with the OCD \nspectrum of disorders. It is usually associated with other psychiatric conditions. Option A: Alopecia areata shows well-circumscribed patches of complete hair loss with sparing of \nwhite hair, as shown below. 126 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Pseudopelade of Brocq is a scarring alopecia that produces small round or oval patches \nof smooth alopecia, described as footprints in the snow. Option C: Telogen effluvium can occur 2-3 months after systemic stress such as surgery or illness, \nbut it causes diffuse hair loss, not patchy as in this patient.",

It has two \ncharacteristic features, namely: • Ichthyosis linearis circumflexa - a rare form of ichthyosis with scaling and plaques. • Trichorrhexis invaginata or bamboo hair - characterized by invagination of the distal hair shaft \ninto the proximal portion. It is also called golf-tee or ball and socket appearance as seen below. 127 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Trichorrhexis nodosa is associated with trauma to the hair shaft and arginosuccinic \naciduria. It causes node formation and fractures which results in the thrust paintbrush \nappearance seen below as if two paintbrushes are rubbing against each other. Option C: Menkes kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It \nis associated with pili torti or twisted hairs, seen in the first image, and monilethrix or beaded \nhair, seen in the second image. 128 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Uncombable hair syndrome produces a characteristic triangular cross-section of hair \nand longitudinal groove along one side which contributes to its hair stiffness. 129 \nSold by @itachibot",
